1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:17,429
good afternoon besides Manchester we are

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,410
the beer father's welcome to who we are

3
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:35,550
in a sack

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:39,930
quick quick quick massive c-word on the

5
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,580
screen I don't know for me we carry a

6
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,580
parental advisory because that me says

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,160
conference see whether their children

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
there or not so we feel it's appropriate

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,379
to carry a parental advisory I'm

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:59,429
offended I swear a bit f-bombs generally

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:06,840
John never swears and we don't know much

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:08,340
about you yet so we've got to talk fine

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,350
today's the second time we've given this

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,789
talk we'll talk a little bit about the

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,009
first time again this job as well in a

16
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:16,560
few minutes it's called rage against the

17
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:19,740
foot so reg against the fear uncertainty

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
and doubt okay concepts that many of you

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,818
will be familiar with working in the

20
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,159
information security industry often used

21
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,450
by manufacturers and products to scare

22
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,299
you effectively into buying their

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,850
particular brand possible theories yeah

24
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:37,740
scary shit what will die set the

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,419
concepts with dissect the concepts as

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,009
well understand glad you said that not

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,959

28
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,689

00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,999
the three hours before we start can I

30
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,589
just do this you come here if they

31
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:52,259
almost take a photograph at the back of

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:59,299
this app some honey and then translate

33
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,299

[Music]

36
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,420
back really before we get into the main

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,859
content around what we're up to this

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,018
year so we've been pretty bloody busy

39
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,000
actually I see a lot of people here

40
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,000
we've seen various talks around the UK

41
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,440
[Laughter]

42
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,910
the the bed farmers came into existence

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,359
in August last year so we've been on

44
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,890
yeah we came out with a few ideas what

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,390
we thought at the time was going on in

46
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,238
the image security industry was that it

47
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,510
was up its own ass still as a persona a

48
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,950
sport we can see its legs now okay

49
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,260
if you take it so far too seriously and

50
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,760
what a friction or a drama again still

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,169
plugging it up going on there well we

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:05:05,289
came together and thought would put a

53
00:04:26,169 --> 00:05:07,419
few ideas around so we put let's put

54
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,150
talking to conference just catalyzed

55
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,310
speculatively and we put talking to

56
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,400
besides leads and Mark Carney to his

57
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,900
eternal credit said yeah if you like the

58
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,190
idea of the bear farmers we take the

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,620
piss a little bit we're a parody rock

60
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,300
group come along and do stuff and we did

61
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,130
a talk and it went down pretty well

62
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,080
knocked on from that so we've gone

63
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,789
around the UK talking about companies

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,890
that take your security seriously or

65
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:32,260
actually don't take security seriously

66
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,640
that's been quite a popular topic and we

67
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,320
thought the middle of the year will kind

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,580
of turn it on its head a lot they do

69
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,070
talk about something else

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,960
so we've been around a little bit this

71
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,810
talk we gave at steel comp in Sheffield

72
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,250
on the 13th of July and we've modified

73
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,340
the content so there's some stuff we

74
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,200

75
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,570
show house who was a steel comments or

76
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,750
our talk

77
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,750
[Music]

78
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,870
alcohol was a thing and by the way Dave

79
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:14,989
cheers for the whole group yeah so I

80
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:19,610
we got poisoned and still gone so as we

81
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:23,259
were about to literally before we were

82
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,460
due to speak we were still on the stage

83
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,909
and he was on the stage with what

84
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,859
appeared to be a glass of whiskey and

85
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:32,840
then on round robin

86
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,300
you know the co-organizers of Steel come

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,830
and so guys in here I'm whisky with

88
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,889
always got one so this is the same shit

89
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,169
right no it was different shit

90
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:49,610
it was 500,000 scoville noggin right the

91
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:52,128
vodka you saw exactly what happened

92
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,129
right the entire tour fell to shit

93
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,750
I was nervous right now is your drinking

94
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,490
like 30 year old whiskey we were

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,270
drinking the shit was swept out the

96
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,910
toilet floor

97
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,760
argue with the same thing but yeah so he

98
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:10,120
took it well to begin with like a chump

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:18,460
and Shawn fell upon heat then I can

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:20,410
speak for about 10 to 15 minutes acting

101
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,780
I couldn't get anything working in the

102
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,160
ITU all fell apart and it just kind of

103
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,169
bollocks took the first ten minutes I

104
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,430
don't think we found a provision doesn't

105
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:34,660
show the bed oh I talk yeah it's got to

106
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,100
plan so explana also good so that was

107
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,600
that was still conscious building really

108
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,940
well killing a bunch of people in

109
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,760
Southie option and that chooses to

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,830
strategically poison its main track

111
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,550
speakers and they didn't just get up so

112
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,030
they got Scott hell they got who's the

113
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,640
guy

114
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,119
so guys some guy come a couple of people

115
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,120
yeah

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,289
so feral 17 doubts Edvard Munch's scream

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,050
right I'm sorta in for a bit of culture

118
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,810
I know nothing about a particular in it

119
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:18,370
it's knit they got the gun

120
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:19,660
copy back so let's just quickly cover

121
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,550
what the concepts of fear uncertainty

122
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,330
and doubt are so fear is the idea that

123
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,130
your husband told me that you it's an

124
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,380
emotion a chemical emotion that's caused

125
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:33,039
by a threat of danger paying harm see

126
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,330
you ought to love me somebody sticking a

127
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,390
gun at your face is gonna arouse that

128
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,520
particular emotion uncertainty is well

129
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,669
do it left room I take the right room

130
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,319
not entirely sure it's a lack of

131
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,430
confidence in being able to make a

132
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,040
judgment of correct decision and doubt

133
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,969
is the am I being told the truth am I

134
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,620
being told a lie I'm not entirely sure

135
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,360
could blatantly mean to make a decision

136
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,220
couldn't able to make a dangerous

137
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:07,960
decision so who recognizes this concept

138
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:10,510
out here yeah so it's it's Danny Thomas

139
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,800
okay so Thomas was an apostle where did

140
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,460
believe that Jesus could have arisen

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,819
from

142
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,700
from his crucifixion and its shanking by

143
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,290
a Roman soldier in despair what Jesus

144
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,620
did was he said yet fingers in that

145
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,719
proves you that this actually happened

146
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,140
allegedly was what dealt with Thomas's

147
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,870
doubts

148
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,870
okay well the deities are available

149
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,990
there are lots of good books out there

150
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,810
okay

151
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:51,460
so anybody shout out what films this

152
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:52,599
line from so somebody said two people

153
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,420
said The Matrix

154
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,930
no never God said they never got said in

155
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,790
the film it's a Mandela effect that

156
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,560
people believe it was said see when

157
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,560
Morpheus gives the blue pill red pill

158
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,660
thing tanea they never got said itself

159
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,130
but popular culture is perpetuating it

160
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,510
as a thing that actually got said in the

161
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:18,160
movie and people assume I'm asked

162
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:20,770
whether it was said well yeah it's a

163
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,120
falsehood the people let them become

164
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,900
institutionally delete to believe him

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,570
all right

166
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:33,610
all right bullshit so that's what we

167
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:36,610
think I don't normally get laughs so

168
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,710
Bloomberg okay Bloomberg are a really

169
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,530
big US news outlet and they talk about

170
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,210
everything the talk a lot of crap and

171
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,860
here's an example of that so the

172
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,230
publisher I think it was in October last

173
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,960
year and the article was around the the

174
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,760
idea that super mikro of the motherboard

175
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,190
manufacturer was having Chinese

176
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,569
government insert chips implanted onto

177
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,190
their motherboards that would have been

178
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:02,770
sold to Western countries Western

179
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:05,800
manufacturers and the backdoor data okay

180
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:09,400
all about to Beijing Chinese government

181
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,229
it was but some Alex it wasn't true and

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,120
their claim was it affected everybody as

183
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,030
big as Apple and Microsoft and Intel

184
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,460
Iran affected by this problem there was

185
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,620
no evidence at all in support of this

186
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,070
being truth and he would happily come

187
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,310
out and said this is

188
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:29,720
just shit yeah it's absolutely untrue so

189
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:37,310
we released a record chairman in my

190
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:39,440
diffuser I see this was when that just

191
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,930
before we have weekly charts where oh

192
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,490
yeah songs of the performance right so

193
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,989
every way what they do from the bear

194
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,910
farmers Twitter account is publishing

195
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,150
you record that we'd released because it

196
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,969
can % Rock lots and we pick the topic of

197
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,780
that particular wakin with domain that

198
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,000
was amazing

199
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:03,610
associating this particular example of

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,870
bullshit Bluebird pray regularly

201
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,050
headline-grabbing out clicking click

202
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:25,820
make yummy other that's what that the

203
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:35,839
symphony one Billy Ray would you're not

204
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:39,800
in the room Dan school is great very

205
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,410
very solid journalist but therefore

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,969
securing mommy's ear upset magazine

207
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:47,660
close to this article earlier in the air

208
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:51,080
which got us a little bit angry I'm glad

209
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,880
to say the idea that there were flaws

210
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,680
discovered in in popular password

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,300
managers with the flaw was boiled down

212
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,339
to cached credentials if Windows

213
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,609
machines and that could be a problem

214
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,260
that causes any kind of compromise

215
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,230
it's nothing specific to password

216
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,920
managers it was also bollocks but the

217
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,270
actual article had its title modified

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,459
that's what it actually said originally

219
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,800
that using password managers is no more

220
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,900
secure than using a text file now if

221
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,030
that's not a headline grab then I've got

222
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,630
no idea what is I don't know if you can

223
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:26,270
read that there but the change of title

224
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:30,710
but I categorically forgot to modify the

225
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:32,980
URL and that left in half of the

226
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,860
original statement

227
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,720
and so the the research company that did

228
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,710
this kind of that truck in a lot of that

229
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,140
that kind of sound bites and rhetoric as

230
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,660
did the writer of the article here but

231
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,699
because it was absolutely not true

232
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,680
that's where manager is nothing like

233
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,730
using a text file in order to store you

234
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:58,979
could actually spilling secrets yes on

235
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,690
some entity but it was a general point

236
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,270
and it picked yeah it's about that from

237
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,140
a common sense we're trying to bring

238
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,530
this away

239
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,760
try to bring awareness and then just say

240
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,720
password manager is a secure solution

241
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,040
we've been doing that a lot of those

242
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,160
people in there it's like doing that

243
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,349
this kind of articles are that's what we

244
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,969
need and and it's not that everyone has

245
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,580
to use a password management at least

246
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,280
they can form decisions and all the way

247
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,110
the use of a password manager against

248
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,240
reusing best restaurants since that's

249
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,240
what it's all about then password

250
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,980
managers have flaws let's this is really

251
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,740
ridiculous and taken out of context and

252
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,640
what bothers me the most is that is just

253
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,160
yeah

254
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,910
a lot of people just lightly believe

255
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,439
this awareness and and then you get this

256
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,060
kind of articles I think that's that's

257
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,450
not good at all yeah it brings about

258
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,709
behavior yes you say from what you

259
00:14:52,450 --> 00:15:04,630
perceived to be an authoritative source

260
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:07,210
like the media I don't know I don't know

261
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:10,150
to be honest how many foods do they get

262
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,800
that could be was I picked from this

263
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,230
organization because they were the

264
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,620
breaking news outlet but there were five

265
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,200
or six other new that did example of the

266
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,470
same thing yeah but the media influence

267
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,830
is a lot more than you attention he

268
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:30,720
realized so I have a beside job UK

269
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:37,510
spokesman para tech calm last week I

270
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:40,150
gave a comment to media about they last

271
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,620
upgrade that actually unfixed to fix

272
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,329
they've done in the upgrade before I

273
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,590
believe you've heard about it and they

274
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,960
were like werewolf

275
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:50,800
two or three days so I told the Sun

276
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,950
newspaper not on purpose that I was

277
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,260
going to switch off my iPhone and go and

278
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:59,650
get an admin pay as you go for two days

279
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,270
until they fix the thing and I'm pretty

280
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,640
sure that got like 15 million hits

281
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,110
online so out of those 15 million

282
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,120
people's some of them will have actually

283
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:24,250
taken me seriously and ditched their

284
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:30,300
iPhone I didn't because especially an

285
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,300
expert cause your crying out loud anyway

286
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,299
[Music]

287
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:20,280
education right so our FA MFA whatever

288
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:22,290
fa sweet FA this is a debate that rages

289
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,849
deigned out online

290
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,770
all right about the do's and don'ts and

291
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:30,480
rights and wrongs and multifactor off ya

292
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,070
is SMS to FA a good idea right went very

293
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,050
public a few months ago so actually it's

294
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,879
better than not having any MFA at all

295
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,070
which I felt that the time was a

296
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,620
perfectly reasonable argument so for

297
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,350
ordinary users of the services that

298
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,020
supports our FA by our SNS then great

299
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:49,919
switch it on and that wasn't to Ofcom

300
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,139
made change last month to make sim or

301
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,060
account swapping a matter of simply

302
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,000
sending a text to you provider and

303
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,980
they'll take care of everything and for

304
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,080
me that kind of became a bit of a little

305
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,580
pat set off moment around let me see all

306
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,070
the general safety in there so that's

307
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,260
based to a mate and I problem for then

308
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,389
got my original argument and said

309
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,879
actually I'm not so sure it's good idea

310
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:18,120
anymore so chaps any thoughts or not

311
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,980
honestly yeah you're right it still at

312
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,080
least what you're talking about I'm not

313
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,670
aware about Belgium but I think some

314
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,939
swapping and things and we're really

315
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,560
really rare and very targets some

316
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,660
countries in the world as different also

317
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,370
new as I know that's that's a common

318
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,980
practices there's a lot said but that's

319
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,050
still going on a lot so yes as a mess

320
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,080
based not really good but still better

321
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,180
than the one I'm a MFA in my opinion and

322
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,060
if you have just used an Authenticator

323
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,490
app that would be it would be really

324
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,179
great but thing is everything is

325
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,790
hackable

326
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,800
only what we've seen this with Google's

327
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,649
with their own employees they have this

328
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,379
this physical key and no one was fished

329
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,360
and I don't know long time it was that

330
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,370
they that they have done it but they

331
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,830
really no see

332
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:09,539
of effective session that's why using

333
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,210
the physical key so yes that that's the

334
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,158
only that's the best way we know at the

335
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,890
moment but that's still it's also not

336
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,380
feasible for a forget merge user to use

337
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,270
these physical keys it's also too

338
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,820
expensive so we have to deal with what

339
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,700
we have so yet my opinion as a mass base

340
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,950
2 of a if that's the best possible

341
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:33,210
solution

342
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,440
nothing is a complex issues it depends

343
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,750
on the platform using the phone you go

344
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,179
for a bank for example if I use MFE

345
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,590
perhaps a we have multi wheels of

346
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,149
aesthetic issue it's not multi-factor

347
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,070
where you have a passphrase and you have

348
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:46,739
your passport so bike will call that a

349
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:50,158
Fe but realistically if you have second

350
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,100
fat phone SMS nearly slow the bearer but

351
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,690
like John says using a thin it's done

352
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,260
depend on well the basis of there are

353
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,570
weeds end but realistically if you're

354
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,610
attempting to be hacked by credentials

355
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,049
office you're a complex solution and

356
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:12,719
there's no second factor that I think

357
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:16,850
adding something thanks very much I

358
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,649
won't sing a song I know some it's

359
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:23,100
looking at the security protocols like

360
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:24,779
that adoption is the hardest bit so any

361
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,908
kind of extra security is clearly

362
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,380
brilliant because criminals are lazy and

363
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,240
criminals are greedy and if they knock

364
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:34,409
on one door and it's locked they'll go

365
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,450
knock on another one but making people

366
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,000
adopt any kind of extra security measure

367
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,740
is incredibly difficult I've been a

368
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,120
magistrate for 12 and a half years and

369
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,260
we have a thing called the judicial

370
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,570
intranet which is a closed internet

371
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,990
platform for judicial office holders

372
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,299
across the UK and last year I think it

373
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,070
was the Ministry of Justice decided that

374
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,799
they would implement two-factor

375
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,139
authentication for access to the

376
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,179
judicial internet and every single old

377
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,799
judge with a wig and a pompous voice

378
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,070
said I'm not remembering another

379
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,570
password bugger off so they didn't do it

380
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,270
they've done it now but they had a long

381
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,530
hard slog to make people adopt it's a

382
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,680
point being you

383
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,740
a brilliant idea is about extra security

384
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:25,080
layers but getting people to use them is

385
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:28,410
probably to my mind - part yes exactly

386
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:42,060
security as an enabler not as a blocker

387
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:44,580
I think we as IT security professionals

388
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,129
we kind of think inside our bubble a bit

389
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,909
too much as well so we can't go on about

390
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,620
the idea of UCF and he became the talk

391
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:59,390
of wax lyrical about how great these

392
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:59,389
things are we got the rollouts my mum

393
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,040
that's one of the barriers to Security's

394
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,580
us as a community of information

395
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,139
security professionals hopefully we give

396
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,010
really simple things really horrible

397
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:23,280
stupid names like penetration tester bug

398
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,920
bounties all these kind of labels we

399
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,960
give to things that preclude the general

400
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,060
population from understanding what we're

401
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,610
saying don't even get me started on

402
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:35,419
packet sniffers and backdoor spammers is

403
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,419
all bobbins

404
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,080
we like to talk about this sort of thing

405
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:58,570
this is about the idea of significance

406
00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:02,919
okay but how secure is a certificate we

407
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:05,350
need Scott his next go to certain

408
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,000
organizations and trustee fry an example

409
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:13,030
of this and well know CAS are examples

410
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,710
of this a certificate is more secure the

411
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,690
more you pay for it in their head so for

412
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,179
the vast majority of people in this room

413
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,830
a domain validation certificate is

414
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,230
perfectly adequate okay

415
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,120
before entering the room deeply okay you

416
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,770
own the domain yes sir

417
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,629
prereq okay sir but since things like

418
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,510
let's encrypt so how's it yet who's

419
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,529
gonna let's encrypt yeah loads of people

420
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,529
[Music]

421
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:56,320
improving security but they're funded by

422
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:59,049
and they're they're funded by very large

423
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,830
organizations Mozilla Foundation a fund

424
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:07,559
their Facebook or a fund they're not

425
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,559
making any money any operating profit

426
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,020
and you get your certificate for free

427
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,000
and you can also renew it using that

428
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,470
protocol set up a widget and it will

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,120
call out get your new certificate and

430
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,400
you can have them as regularly as you

431
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,350
want okay yeah that's kind of cool

432
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,610
though because we know revocations bust

433
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,610
yeah so every body

this was in the pictures off your iPhone

436
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:28,610
so that's secret okay free certs it's

437
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,709
not an issue that's the threat to them

438
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,439
at the CIA industry right obviously so

439
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:38,060
the CIA industry's kind of come back

440
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:40,340
with well let's encrypt not a secure and

441
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,800
free sir how can I possibly be secure

442
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,020
but what about extended validation well

443
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,970
what what about having your name in the

444
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,980
bar at the top that really provides

445
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,350
authenticity proof that you are who you

446
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,350
say you are

447
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:56,659
what's the bollocks okay Evie is no more

448
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,300
secure than deeming from a true security

449
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,660
point of view okay I don't throw them

450
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,129
all that little company name bit there

451
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,690
it's disappearing from all of the major

452
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,180
browsers okay

453
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,850
it went on mobile browsers a while back

454
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,190
I think from the current or next

455
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:17,540
iteration of chrome Chrome and suddenly

456
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,670
Leslie to away where we are okay folks

457
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:24,790
as well the one I also September and

458
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,790
Upton and the IE browsers never mind

[Music]

460
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,870
so it's just further yeah it's just the

461
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,690
idea of paying a little bit more money

462
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,969
will give you a more secure SSL seller

463
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,610
absolute rubbish and you can you get

464
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,290
guarantees where you get warranty work

465
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,360
you gets to demand worry so how is there

466
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,409
who's heard of domain Warren safe box

467
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,229
yeah

468
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,550
security warranty so does that it comes

469
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,990
in to keep we have a baguette if you

470
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,629
know what you get back on where it

471
00:26:53,990 --> 00:27:04,370
covers you for or any other stuff you

472
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:06,440
did so how can they study something that

473
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:48,139
they are in the standard room in the

474
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:51,230
first place because you the fuck is

Scott I've got love stickers but it's a

476
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:59,990
workshop so it's true this tinting heck

477
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:03,230
was it just bad now since we bought in

478
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:05,420
my hairspray right the answer lies in

479
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,040
the blockchain so again I don't

480
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,480
understand what the blockchain is fans

481
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:23,240
in here if you really honestly do

482
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:25,550
understand the block diagram it's just a

483
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,040
bunch of all Orlean together and I've

484
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:31,030
just been holding back from posting a

last year he told me that they found

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:06,120
some wirelessly enabled electronic

490
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,130
nipple to the wirelessly enabled

491
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,510
connections it's not secure because no

492
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,630
one secures anything that they connect

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,720
there our blockchain enabled security

497
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:43,400
ensures that you can live a happy life a

498
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:45,680
free TV on ITV in the UK and dads

499
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,350
watching they would be planning r51

500
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,470
whatever the scores on the fuck what

501
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:54,139
does that mean to my dad and it didn't

502
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,430
mean anything to me I'm a secure a pro

503
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,830
and I've been doing technology thirty

504
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,390
years doesn't mean anything to me and I

505
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,340
founded the Matic project from the home

506
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,360
office for two years on bloody Bitcoin

507
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,129
rather than understand it so it's it's a

508
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,870
mathematical thing that goes beyond my

509
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:12,640
comprehension of mathematics right I'll

510
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:17,500
be the first of many famous ladle Hey

511
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:23,500
it's just shine and excuse my age thing

512
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:23,500
so maybe it's not watching it might be

513
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:40,990
we see these four ten quid from River

514
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,990
Island I'm I'm here all week

515
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,770
so next-gen yeah we're all aware of the

516
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,620
idea that if you buy silence is a really

517
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:54,050
getting next-gen protection of the Navy

518
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,179
retinas are available but silence is an

519
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,800
example companies that use a next-gen as

520
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,890
a concept in terms of quality of the

521
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:29,330
product okay doesn't mean anything

522
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:30,980
nothing because all of the but the point

523
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,659
being is our next year this is a bit

524
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,550
like our blockchain enabled that this

525
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:41,420
doesn't tell you anything it really

526
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:44,210
helps to beyond this yeah and I saw one

527
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:48,490
from some cement idea there was negative

528
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,490
zero game yes yes

529
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:47,980
logical conclusion machine learning so

530
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:55,500
again I actually got ya anywhere a

531
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:57,850
sentient computer in this computer human

532
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,500
so Skynet doesn't exist and all that

533
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:02,230
kind of stuff great in the movies but we

534
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,850
haven't got anything computer why's the

535
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,690
can operate with our tech in its initial

536
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,918
instruction from human oh no so stop

537
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,450
selling it like it's going to be the

538
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:11,589
future decision maker because if we do

539
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,719
that we're going to start seeing it be

540
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,230
in the future decision maker okay

541
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:22,569
anybody got thing to add to that now you

542
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:24,270
know graduating so zero days thanks for

543
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,889
that we're not going to talk about

544
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:31,629
nicely or maybe maybe we could talk

545
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:34,030
about this vendor or found 300 K 0 this

546
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:38,290
and one day so tweet yesterday from I

547
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:45,010
think was Gavin Beaumont are you serious

548
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:54,550
I mean who buys that no one I hope it

549
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:56,380
must be smells of your ardent dogs a

550
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,100
smaller we get paid

551
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:02,770
yeah we're in there every other day

552
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:08,080
change everything but we are kind of

553
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:10,030
like zero days really trendy thing

554
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,460
social media loves a good zero-day us to

555
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,590
media okay I'll stand as defenders

556
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,740
vendors love it and Google's Project

557
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:24,370
Sarah love it okay who's heard of those

558
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:26,950
guys all of you need to go it occurs to

559
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,660
me and it's my opinion that there are

560
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:39,819
certain engineers within project zero

561
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:42,220
that don't like Microsoft very much but

562
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,470
I'm like 46 years old and I'm kind of

563
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:47,169
grown up with technology didn't see jzm

564
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:52,000
have a hard paper yeah yes

565
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:55,150
knowingly okay Beirut's but yeah these

566
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,980
modern cool tech companies acquire a

567
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,130
little bit brush for my liking at times

568
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,690
and Google is no debt no exception okay

569
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,250
physician heal thyself is a little

570
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,870
statement about do you get your own shit

571
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,090
in order before you start criticizing

572
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:10,299
all the people I'm Google's previously

573
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:11,920
situation is terrible okay some of the

574
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,560
technological decisions equally terrible

575
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,600
but they take great delight and Thomas

576
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,890
on Monday being one example a Google

577
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,630
project zero researcher takes

578
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:25,180
serious delight in fine hotshots it

579
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,760
marks off gel direction there was a

580
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:31,710
relatively benign Windows 10 on

581
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:35,470
certificate bug relatively benign in the

582
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:41,410
the article who really own plague the

583
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:43,629
risk to anybody of it but the researcher

584
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,960
played as well or what bothers me that

585
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:49,390
this is Microsoft was responses so he

586
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,060
disclosed it to Microsoft and then you

587
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,350
see the the old timeline it's published

588
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,210
NEC Microsoft

589
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,220
it's not that they ignore them miss it

590
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,040
yes we will fix it we need more time and

591
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,359
then nineteen days of lighting ninety

592
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,400
days are over and they just

593
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,730
okay you can say this is the way we do

594
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,570
it with every company if fair enough I

595
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:13,220
guess but honestly if a company which

596
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:16,250
you disclose a buck to business it's

597
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,919
really working together with you well

598
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,650
Nia Betsy RISM fix it together and it's

599
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,510
better at least it's the end user who

600
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,210
should benefit from it that's my my

601
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,640
honest opinion and give them a month two

602
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,430
months more and then it's all be fine

603
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,290
yeah you're absolutely right

604
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,700
Microsoft did engage people have said we

605
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,200
can't release in this part usually

606
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,970
because we don't think it's aesthetics

607
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,649
recently

608
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,750
yeah give us another Patch Tuesday in a

609
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,190
month's time I'll do it for you there

610
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,370
was another one recently and that was

611
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:50,800
some kind of yeah nothing easy fix for

612
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:54,319
Microsoft it wasn't part of us or some

613
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,380
some I remember anymore it was a few

614
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,620
weeks ago yeah I wasn't in the kernel

615
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,990
that's what yeah and the main way of a

616
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,089
flip was a Windows message and I think

617
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,370
so and yeah then again

618
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:10,430
it's not reasonable that they can fix it

619
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:13,009
in the light II guess so yeah I don't

620
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,609
know as well come through in a couple of

621
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:19,100
days as an intercept professional but

622
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:21,350
cares about security posture my

623
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,480
company's zero days are not actually on

624
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:29,500
top of my product okay there are things

625
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,500
that are because of you growing steadily

626
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,490
is for Annette whoever and it's

627
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,140
vulnerable to stuff you won't think like

628
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:38,779
what take one a cry for example that was

629
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,190
a little thing that was popped imagine

630
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,550
that'd be pretty high up your list to

631
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,840
not have your shit pawned indeed Apache

632
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,220
would have been my parrot and when the

633
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:51,560
cruise released in that particular time

634
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:55,339
true so right do you want to have that

635
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:58,870
government statement well this one's

636
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,870
masters filming me from over there

637
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:06,780
[Laughter]

638
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,540
what would you like me to say about this

639
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:15,869
well give an example the NSA Oh on them

640
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:17,220
and a few miles away bananas about all

641
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:19,200
of your machines globally otherwise

642
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,529
things probably didn't happen this is

643
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,450
guys it's quite rare for the NSA and

644
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,090
governors-general to get that involved

645
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,830
in the rhetoric and the advisories and

646
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,270
stuff that led me to believe that at the

647
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:34,920
time it was because it was a risk to the

648
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:37,350
NSA okay so that's my example my slide

649
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,900
there was one couple of months ago I

650
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:42,950
think it might have been a zero-day on

651
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,260
firefox and then the US authorities

652
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,759
issued as well and you bang on the money

653
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,140
it's not because they're worried about

654
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,730
other people that use those platforms

655
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,600
it's because there's a threat to them

656
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:57,240
and so by encouraging the rest of the

657
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,720
uptaking community to secure the

658
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,020
platform they're benefitting by proxy

659
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,359
because then most of us just the user

660
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,740
community doing their security for them

661
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:12,540
but they also have more I'm gonna say a

662
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:15,180
proper grown-up work company I'm saying

663
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:20,790
this in company holistic view of what's

664
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:24,049
going on and so they have more ability

665
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:28,050
to manipulate the stuff and potentially

666
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:30,420
backdoor themselves as well so that you

667
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,580
know will work hard to patch staff and

668
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,770
bug bounty stuff that actually they

669
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,600
probably you know sort themselves out

670
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,900
first before they've asked us to help

671
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:50,549
them out you might want to just edit

672
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:52,230
that bit censorship in our talks yeah if

673
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,090
we did censorship they are tops they're

674
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,619
not catastrophe at the start still calm

675
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,950
nobody would

676
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:00,749
I'd never be able to speak okay I'm

677
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,308
actually now really proud and pleased

678
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,828
I'm banned from Yorkshire by the police

679
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:06,779
so I wasn't there to see it we're gonna

680
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:10,229
smuggle you in when you gotta

681
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:11,670
inconspicuous right quite bendy as well

682
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:19,368
so you could get me in a suitcase excuse

683
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:19,369
me I can do the crap I won't do it now

684
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,379
[Music]

685
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:32,549
no suitcase oh so that's the reason

686
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:33,839
really that I'm less worried about zero

687
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:35,819
days and then back to my organization

688
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,019
because actually it's the old crap that

689
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:38,759
you've got to worry about the fact that

690
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:44,640
you've got my lifecycle management so

691
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:46,109
iris you don't know Linux machines over

692
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,328
there with SSH open on the internet

693
00:41:46,109 --> 00:42:06,749
because they were built 15 years ago by

694
00:41:48,329 --> 00:42:11,249
engineers this is this is fine it's a

695
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:14,519
few years on there look for any I'm sure

696
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:16,799
you people to go down there so yeah the

697
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,109
point being is that there are things

698
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:21,359
closer to home rather than cool zero

699
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,098
days that you were really going to pay

700
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,808
attention to so you're going to do your

701
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,339
asset management popular because number

702
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,920
one in security is understanding what

703
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:30,479
you your threat posture is and if you

704
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,759
don't know about this infrastructure set

705
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:35,069
over here then you screw okay maybe

706
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:37,319
don't know exists you can't touch it and

707
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:39,890
then you get pop what a cry stop yeah as

708
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:43,739
I said that petition that ask Minister

709
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:45,979
if you love you have correct I'm

710
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:49,769
standing on the money if you ask a

711
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:51,839
particular global supermarket brands

712
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:54,328
that I won't name as I'm being filmed

713
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,190
how many tins of baked beans they have

714
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:58,489
in all of the supermarkets all across

715
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,489
the world

716
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,930
in their entire global estate and every

717
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,609
supermarket that I own other super want

718
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:26,660
to change our available they'll tell you

719
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,660
to the minute exactly

720
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:25,569
you said that you're too busy listening

721
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,980
to us talk shit

722
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:30,380
well not less thing for kind of get to

723
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,540
the end now but just re-emphasize my

724
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,130
point from the previous slide you look

725
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,750
at these particular examples here there

726
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:40,820
that just got dumped I wanna cry and

727
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:44,360
want to cry because like I say with

728
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:51,740
Windows SMB v1 supported and four or

729
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:58,330
five into the internet which was what 15

730
00:44:51,740 --> 00:45:02,240
years my cycle the NHS is still buying

731
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:12,620
20,000 devices on Windows XP even though

732
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:23,379
they've got to know if I won a prize in

733
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:23,380
the Sun token hookers

734
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:30,339
the actual Institute for Health Research

735
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:32,349
for three years okay working on amongst

736
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:35,259
other projects for the National patient

737
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:41,410
registry system which was a four billion

738
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:43,150
an eight billion million pound project

739
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,828
that failed to deliver and paid a hell

740
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,849
of a while contractures a lot of money

741
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,530
okay

742
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:49,049
where's McAfee involved this it sounds

743
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:53,559
like a war yeah I think you've answered

744
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:56,410
let's see Equifax

745
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:58,119
okay so Equifax is we don't need to talk

746
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:00,490
about the story and Equifax because you

747
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:05,280
see very well documented for Apache

748
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:05,279
struts was the problem there existed

749
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:29,309

754
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:48,849
that you seen in the online magazines

755
00:47:44,799 --> 00:48:02,819
and news outlets that's just there okay

756
00:47:48,849 --> 00:48:05,440
simple as that no other reason so

757
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:07,509
immature learning blockchain that's all

that particular vendor product sales but

760
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:15,849
things like the government and probably

761
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,680
bigger news outlets I think it's around

762
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:19,479
behavioral control I think that's what

763
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,759
it's all about it's about scaring you to

764

making decision this in there interested

765
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,630
me to do it and as I said at the end

766
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,879

nothing it wasn't heavy weight stuff it
