we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just briefly cover well</font>

71
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,620
not briefly but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover</font>

72
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,930
what hash functions are and and and why

73
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,640
we were used right so one of the

74
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,900
mathematical functions so we have some

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,208
input that we pumped through this

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,660
algorithm it gives us a flex latest

77
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,700
output<font color="#CCCCCC"> the digest right and the reason</font>

78
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,230
that we like this is it's a compression

79
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,750
function essentially rate so we take

80
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,119
some some data of arbitrary size and we

81
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,090
can compress it down into 160 bits of

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,700
you use my shower<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and 256 bits for a</font>

83
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,430
shot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to right and so you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,459
basically d your digest and some

85
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,040
function and your input and again you're

86
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,340
calling algorithms here sharwan<font color="#E5E5E5"> chateau</font>

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,920
and the West Spanish our family<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot</font>

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,510
three Eric a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat and which is above</font>

89
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,280
adored one because we thought kind of

90
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,760
that Chateau would be much more broken

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,980
than as at this point now and so char

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,720
three was introduced to complement

93
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,390
rather than replace Chateau so that's a

94
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,250
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit odd and but as far as we know</font>

95
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,708
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with fair shot at</font>

96
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,690
the moment right so from a cryptographic

97
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,820
hash functions we expect these things

98
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre image and second fear meet</font>

99
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,430
resistance and crucially collision

100
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,370
resistance right so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly on</font>

101
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,140
these a pre-event resistance Kevin some

102
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,500
hash value<font color="#E5E5E5"> D it's difficult to find</font>

103
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,370
another message and such that<font color="#E5E5E5"> d is equal</font>

104
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,750
to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a right so essentially what</font>

105
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,610
we're saying here is that it should be

106
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult for some definition of</font>

107
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,850
difficult so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> definition of difficult</font>

108
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,890
is basically beyond reach

109
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,680
of the adversary that we want speaker

110
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,320
system and or you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

111
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that p equals NP and get</font>

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">into asymptotic polynomial time which</font>

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,810
we're not going to do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> adds far</font>

114
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,450
too much wrong last night start talking

115
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that back and but basically this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

116
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,920
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and given a harsh it</font>

117
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,650
should be difficult and to find some

118
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,980
other message that and treat the hash

119
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a second few images us that pre</font>

120
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">image resistance is a bit of a</font>

121
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,900
technicality so for some fix em put em

122
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,460
one so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> give the attacker and then put</font>

123
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,640
the it can't change they have to

124
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:10,380
essentially find another input m2 which

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,969
will and produce the same hash right and

126
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,940
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between this and a</font>

127
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,230
collision is that m1 is fixed and then

128
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,200
the one we all know about collision

129
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,820
resistance or given any input m1 and it

130
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,909
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be difficult to find another</font>

131
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,610
input end to such that digests the m1

132
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,350
and m2 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene so this is what we most</font>

133
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,130
people understand that hash functions

134
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,980
right so if you have a file and any

135
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,420
small subtle change and so these were

136
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,670
created pretty much right after each

137
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,230
other so the may<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

138
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,760
different the better way of doing this

139
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,400
with the beam to air going to share some

140
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,840
but when we thought with after and so

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,729
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see here the only difference use</font>

142
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,650
one character but you have a radically

143
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:55,480
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> em hope of the hash right and</font>

144
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,770
so there was quite a war a talk recently

145
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,710
about and sha-1 been fairly broken right

146
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,740
and so the the free start collision

147
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,250
against the fool he runs a sha-1 and was

148
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,170
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first and actual attack</font>

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">stephens and he you know pretty much</font>

152
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,550

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,760
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tool hash class clash and you</font>

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have taken about the</font>

156
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,869
house and you can find<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jannetty air your</font>

157
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,750
own collisions so what are three star

158
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,610
collision basically

159
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,040
the miracle<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dawnguard construction we</font>

160
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,260
have our message block and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our</font>

161
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,800
chin in value or your initialization

162
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,289
vector right so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> block and we</font>

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,270
don't have a chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> in value so the chain</font>

164
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,400
in value is usually the block that comes

165
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">before right but the first walk we need</font>

166
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,960
to supply an IV right so the free start

167
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,120
collision and basically means that under

168
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Samson ally of the attacker control</font>

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,310
can control the IV and if they can

170
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,160
control the IV and then they can create

171
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,950
a collision right so i think the IV that

172
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">they found effort and by like four bytes</font>

173
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:17,490
or two bikes right and I mean it's quite

174
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">a nice attack and it's not it shouldn't</font>

175
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,680
really have us worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-1 and</font>

176
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,680
hugely the<font color="#E5E5E5"> context that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually talk</font>

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,169
about as certificates right so to go

178
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,270
from some arbitrary n1 and n2 collision

179
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:33,030
to a collision involving certificates

180
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,159
the order of magnitude and against

181
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,799
Clayton earth to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certificate</font>

182
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,810
collision and as orders of magnitude

183
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,060
harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

184
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,180
variables at play and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having said that</font>

185
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,180
and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away from sha-1</font>

186
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,620
and the md5<font color="#CCCCCC"> free stock collision was</font>

187
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,620
found in language sex and we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,560
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> field break against md5 till 2004 and</font>

189
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,200
again having said that and the c/e

190
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,810
browser forum right if you ever wanted

191
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,840
to see a clusterfuck of info SEC and go

192
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,220
look at what they debate and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

193
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,200
browser fallen basically wanted

194
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,300
deprecated shall one which we're doing

195
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,729
and but then you have semantic on the

196
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,970
other hand and just meant a new syrups

197
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:17,669
or shower 14 and super special vendors

198
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,860
right and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> having said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

199
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,200
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving away from sha-1 air to shatter</font>

201
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,310
implement right and so one of the other

202
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,549
cool things about hash functions is the

203
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,250
profession right and very very quick so

204
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:38,459
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> your tenth of a second to</font>

205
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,789
generate something right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

206
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,890
here is is that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go buy em</font>

207
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,890
thi an<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and we can compute like</font>

208
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,340
billions of md5 a second or hundreds of

209
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,550
million

210
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,930
shall I make so the the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of state of</font>

211
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> art at the moment if you're looking</font>

214
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,720
and then you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

215
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,820
realms of impossibility even in the

218
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:14,250
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to have a lot</font>

219
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:15,810
of reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go after and someone with a</font>

password<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a latent characters when I</font>

221
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,390
brute force right and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

222
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,190
here is that it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your</font>

223
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,310
underlying function is if your password

224
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,770
is password one or a day of the week 12

225
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,420
and we're going to track it and we're

226
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,930
going to crack it pretty quickly right

227
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,810
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite nice a link this is</font>

228
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">from one passwords or password</font>

229
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,400
generation thing so they've moved from

230
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gavin you adjust in a mishmash of</font>

231
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,650
nonsense to the sort of you know

232
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,780
dictionary<font color="#CCCCCC"> words separated by special</font>

233
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,340
characters and now a third remember

234
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,780
exactly but i'm pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

235
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,460
less the dictionary words is public

236
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:59,130
right so while it's great for memory

237
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,690
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not great in the long term</font>

238
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,270
because you know the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do</font>

239
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,910
password cracking and not myself but

240
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,040
they're generally pretty clever right if

241
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,410
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the crack in forums like</font>

242
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,270
after the fill and<font color="#E5E5E5"> linkedin breach came</font>

243
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,250
out and the cracked like eighty-six

244
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,500
percent that dumped in like four or<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

245
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,750
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and so these people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

246
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,820
pretty clever and this sort of thing I

247
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,680
don't think is going to fly for very

248
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:28,050
long and i'm part of the place ratio

249
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,270
right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a gem in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Disney or</font>

250
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jerry kasnia don't mean Prince's name</font>

251
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,920
and but his company sick air sagathia

252
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,750
and high-performance computing they

253
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,760
specialize in vex built for password

254
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,730
cracking so this is there sort of

255
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,870
monster<font color="#E5E5E5"> rank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every talus so each if you</font>

256
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:49,500
use a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Zeon's like 32 64 gigs</font>

257
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,420
of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> badass ECC ram</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right and say</font>

258
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,610
it back 20 grand but you be able to

259
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">compute 200 billion md5 a second or like</font>

260
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">687 million char 10 seconds</font>

261
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,329
and these actually are the bandages has

262
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,580
weight benches on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gtx 1080 for any</font>

263
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:12,030
graphics cards enthusiasts right and so

264
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,100
that's pretty impressive so we need

265
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,530
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slower so what we</font>

266
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,080
have is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a key</font>

267
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,370
derivation functions so the basic the

268
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,740
fundamental principle here is we just

269
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,990
ate some cryptographic function so it

270
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,600
can be an underlying hash function or a

271
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,980
block cipher and the standard model of

272
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,760
us has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been kicking about I think the</font>

273
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,710
paper and was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce Schneier and 97</font>

274
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,170
a belief and but the standard model is

275
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,030
you have some spare search space 2 to

276
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,209
the X and we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to extend</font>

277
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and by T which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we get</font>

278
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,670
T from our function and so then the

279
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,310
attacker has to search to the ass costi

280
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,620
mate and that's basically standard model

281
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,510
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of my slides from last</font>

282
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,040
year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was like my second or</font>

283
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,770
third last<font color="#CCCCCC"> late on what we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

284
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,949
using so back then<font color="#E5E5E5"> state-of-the-art for</font>

285
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:04,800
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> pbk DF to pass would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be key</font>

287
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:13,229
right and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all off and nest i believe</font>

288
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,450
of standardized pbk tf2 and basically I

289
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,220
said you know if you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be faps if</font>

290
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,410
you need to be compliant for whatever

291
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,660
reason and you probably want to use pbk

292
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,189
tf2 but if your ultra paranoid so for

293
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,610
those of you that use<font color="#E5E5E5"> their key base and</font>

294
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,810
to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> your PGP keys and I think I</font>

295
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,970
don't know if they're you I still does

296
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,910
it but they've used script from day one

297
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and because they obviously take if you</font>

298
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,630

299
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,760
and the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that designed us and colon</font>

ultra paranoid but us somewhat of a

307
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,750
paradox and other self but anyway and

308
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,300
the goal here was to replace pbk tf2 and

309
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,950
at the current time at<font color="#CCCCCC"> V crypt was the</font>

310
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,810
other sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state-of-the-art</font>

311
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key derivation function right</font>

312
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,430
and its primary goal able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> beam am</font>

313
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,920
really hard so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

314
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,270
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mothers quite sure</font>

315
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,339
actually but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to start getting</font>

316
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,520
mathematical formulas<font color="#E5E5E5"> out because quite</font>

317
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,410
frankly I just don't like math and but

318
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,660
basically you want an algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

319
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,569
uses almost as many memory locations and

320
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,100
as it does operations right so for the

321
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,710
number of clock cycles that we're using

322
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,080
para pipe and we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a</font>

323
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,240
similar amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM so that's when I</font>

324
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">random access machines or sequential</font>

325
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,790
memory hardness essentially the same

326
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing and but we don't want at parallel</font>

327
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,790
well item<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so you should use a</font>

328
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,950
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> some larger in trauma my cell are</font>

329
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,349
as you're talking like a kilobyte around

330
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,480
here is what we regard as a significant

331
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:02,070
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM and it shouldn't parallel</font>

332
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,320
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> right having and so this other</font>

333
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,330
requirement and here it was sort of

334
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
introduced with them are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

335
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,530
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that later but</font>

336
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,960
essentially and if there's a warm out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

337
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,329
memory being used we should up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the and</font>

338
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,940
the clock cycles per byte to compensate

339
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,680
for that and I'm one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the one of the</font>

340
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,620
many attacks here is tiny memory

341
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,689
trade-off right so and if your problem

342
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,270
can be solved quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> but requires more</font>

343
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,610
memory and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend more time and</font>

344
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,680
less memory right and or you can use

345
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,070
more memory and solve the problem more

346
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,170
quickly right so the classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font>

347
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,690
type memory trade-off as rainbow tables

348
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,760
and look up tables right you do so on a

349
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,770
pre computation so then you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

350
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
check against your West when it comes to

351
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,510
the crack and rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

352
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,920
computation on the flag right and so at

353
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,170
the time script was pretty

354
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,550
state-of-the-art<font color="#CCCCCC"> compostable a pretty</font>

terms of a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we Lakers</font>

357
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,240
cryptography so what cryptographers like

358
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,980
at just to clarify not a cryptographer

359
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,330
definitely not a mathematician<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

which then caused Rome X which caused

364
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,670
bought max which calls south of waiting

365
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,939
and then we pop that back into PB<font color="#CCCCCC"> gdf to</font>

366
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,919
sew em

367
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:26,978
the beginning here we take our password

368
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,959
we pump it through pbk<font color="#CCCCCC"> tf2 to get that</font>

369
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:31,329
stream we then feed that into ash mix

370
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,449
that goes into romex blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

371
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:36,998
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we run one last phone the pbk df2</font>

372
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:40,899
at the end and to hear a password right

373
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:43,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">now unfortunately for scrap wrong net</font>

374
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,639
wrong net to the side channel so if you

375
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:49,169
have some spy process on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine</font>

376
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,879
that's running and script you can then

377
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:54,879
use in cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> payments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a channels you can</font>

378
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:57,729
basically compute the the passwords

379
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,129
faster by looking at em house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

380
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:01,779
memory locations that script is access

381

and then you can pre-compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> you free</font>

382
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:06,970
and so it has deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahmo's your cpu</font>

383
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:09,609
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs ramp walk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size and then</font>

384
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,039
some parallelization factor and the

385
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:14,199
other nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that em it's</font>

386
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,029
all done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 32-bit math so one of the</font>

387
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,819
sort of requirements of slowing it down

388
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:22,809
and not kerala air paralyzing well as a

389
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:25,809
32-bit masturbate and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think script on</font>

390
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:28,358
the time when you first<font color="#CCCCCC"> benchmark that</font>

391
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,608
and core two processors it was about one

bite of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM for every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 cork cycles</font>

393
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:37,419
right and so password hashing

394
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:42,429
competition and was initiated thinking

395
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:44,709
2012 and the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do anything by</font>

396
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:47,079
consensus for cryptography is to have a

397
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,779
competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's basically like a</font>

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:52,478
ruler therapy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people submit</font>

399
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,149
their candidate and then once we have

00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,739
the list of candidates and all the

401
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:01,059

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:08,470
Garrett off script and and zooskool whoa

427
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,049
coxal Haren who is the guy doing and

428
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,500
that new cryptocurrency looks really

429
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:18,009
cool I forget what's called and so the

430
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,169
basic goals here so they had 24 canvas

431
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:22,269
initially and<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of them with their</font>

432
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:26,889
were withdrawn to the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of twenty two</font>

433
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:29,769
candidates and about<font color="#CCCCCC"> name and finite but</font>

434
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:31,240
the the goals here were wearing anything

435
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:32,649
really wild they basically wanted

436
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,590
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a simple construction</font>

437
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:37,539
and in terms of cryptographic primitives

438
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,389
and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was easy to implement</font>

439
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:42,009
right because as we just saw from<font color="#E5E5E5"> script</font>

440
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:44,769
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colin like eight primitives</font>

441
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:48,009
nested inside each other not a fun time

442
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:49,840
and the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal one terms of</font>

443
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:52,419
security was to be resistant to like

444
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,519
your massive parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

445
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:57,610
application specific integrated circuit

446
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,649
track invite and they want inside

447
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,779
channel resistance and they wanted

448
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:05,139
resistance from tight memory tree doors

449
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:07,269
as well and crucially<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well in terms</font>

450
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:09,820
of end use the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

451
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,950
parameterization to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

452
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,559
right so the only two knobs you can use

453
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,259
that you should be using to Tunis and

454
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,960
our memory and type and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

455
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:23,159
that and again the last sort of

456
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,570
requirement of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that M the</font>

457
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,809
function itself and any underlying

458
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,450
functions and should be patent and

459
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:33,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">boiled free and for the you know the</font>

460
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,840
greater good of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community so</font>

461
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:40,809
initialize in 2012 and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFP ran for a</font>

462
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,649
year close the marks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

463
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:46,649
announce the finalists in q3 2014 and

464
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,129
ironically<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the time I gave this talk</font>

465
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,530
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

466
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,810
version of this talk in 2014 I had no

467
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,000
idea this was going on and which kind of

468
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:58,780
sucks but he'll and then the announce

469
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,250
the winner on their july<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9th of last</font>

470
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:07,629
year so the winner was a function called

471
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:09,810
argan to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aragon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to I was designed by</font>

472
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,880
some lovely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgium Aang and although</font>

473
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,889
the number of primitives that we have in

474
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,510
cryptography designed by Belgians is

475
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,520
really disproportionate right I mean

476
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,650
they keep designing really good trip

477
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,710
though and the current and latest

478
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,810
version nurse is 1.3 and and we're going

479
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk briefly about some of the other</font>

480
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:32,889
end versions and the problems they had

481
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,780
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> N the possible input parameters</font>

482
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,360
with us so we only actually care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

483
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,889
and s for the most part and so your

484
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,949
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing your password in your</font>

485
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,840
nonce so I'm again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're getting to this</font>

486
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,790
bar soul is required but you have your

487
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,889
message string your knowns and your

488
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,590
degree of parallelism so the the

489
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,620
parallelism is what defines so many

490
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,810
independent and compute change you like

491
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,090
rights independent compute change but

492
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,700
but it is synchronized get into this

493
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,429
your air<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the maximum amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM to</font>

494
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,500
be filled and Kelly Bates<font color="#E5E5E5"> and T number</font>

495
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:09,700
of iterations so that's your time

496
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,950
parameter m and then you can you can use

497
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,740
icq keys with us so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use it a key</font>

498
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,050
function as well and and then some

499
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,760
associate<font color="#E5E5E5"> dia up to you know some</font>

500
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:22,510
arbitral and the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> its and some</font>

501
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,490
length like 32 bytes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is me</font>

502
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,810
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand like three papers</font>

503
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,970
have been written<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this on my</font>

504
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,500
whiteboard and then you know now you're

505
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:34,300
just repeating out there cheers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

506
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:38,560
and so I quite a high level how it works

507
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:41,500
and so we set up h0 so each 0 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 64</font>

508
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,649
byte value and we run some hash function

509
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,480
over all these values and so the values

510
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,330
are taken and we we spend the values of

511
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,880
the 32-bit integer a representation of

512
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,250
work with the values and then we run

513
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">some hash over and the case are gone too</font>

514
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,980
they use the break to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function so</font>

515
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,710
Blake<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be was designed by the guy that</font>

516
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">mushy</font>

517
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,700
competition and they've actually just in

518
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,940
the last few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days I names the new</font>

519
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,779
version or produced a new version of

520
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,789
bleak for<font color="#CCCCCC"> EM scrutiny the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

521
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:15,200
so we run a hash function over the

522
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:18,770
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> the soul and all the other</font>

523
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:23,120
planners<font color="#E5E5E5"> em and we get some 64 byte</font>

524
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:26,570
value right and so the the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

525
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">legwork comes in here where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a 2d</font>

526
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:34,580
array so you know a byte array with ing

527
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:36,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">Anna and then we fell n number of em</font>

528
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,220
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM so that is the the memory</font>

529
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,260
that the amount of the maximum ram

530
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,350
defined in the input parameters right

531
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,169
and we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that number of a 1024</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bite</font>

532
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">walks and then we see eventually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

533
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:55,370
sequential dependent and we fill that

534
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:59,390
that rig right so the first bi 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bi</font>

535
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:02,178
1 are dependent on the National 64 byte

536
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,809
value that you get em from hashing all

537
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:07,429
this and then from then on the the box

538
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:11,029
or dependent on what came before

539
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:14,990
ascension so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great and this is</font>

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:35,360
great to go read because they have

547
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,980
lovely diagrams like this helps you

548
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,199
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but so then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Clemente the the</font>

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,750
reference implementation uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> an for</font>

550
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,850
memory slices so this is the slices are

551
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:50,059
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> high we partition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM and then</font>

552
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:52,520
we have penumbral<font color="#E5E5E5"> lanes so again the the</font>

553
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:56,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of lanes is defined in your your</font>

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:59,149
peril<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISM factor right so at each slice</font>

555
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:02,029
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're computed in parallel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

556
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:04,189
they can't reference books and from

557
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:06,620
other slices right and but all other

558
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,600
blocks can be referenced right because

559
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,428
as they could and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I understand</font>

560
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,230
that as the acute reference other block

561
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:14,570
start with them introduce a side channel

562
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:18,380
and a song of some sort right

563
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:20,059
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an when Eragon is doing a</font>

564
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">single pass but we'll all get into that</font>

565
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:24,860
as well and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically we filled this</font>

566
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,009
2d<font color="#E5E5E5"> array over and over again for some</font>

569
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,879

returned the tag again our hash function

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,970
and underlying hash function bleak to

575
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:56,570
over the sea column and then that the

just we've just done some not very

578
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:06,440
complicated math and so it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

579
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,159
family of hash functions so there's two

580
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:16,159
variations so there's 2i and 2d and it's

581
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:18,409
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> memory hard and you can fill a gag</font>

582
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,379
around like a fraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a second right</font>

583
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:23,779
and the the parameterization that we

584
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:26,928
only really care about in terms of the

596
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,169
trying to standardize that's right so

597
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:02,629
the two implementation there to sort of

598
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:06,409

<font color="#E5E5E5">reason so too i am the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> block when</font>

600
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:10,429
we're filling this a 2d array the next

603
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,279
are dependent on the password and salt

604
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,220
so 2i is vulnerable to n 2d sony as

605
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,490
vulnerable to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> channels right because</font>

608
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,678
so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're using I you probably</font>

609
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,110

611
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:40,350
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2d can be used and things like</font>

612
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,809
cryptocurrencies and for proof of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

613
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:45,959
and this sort of thing right and Saudi

614
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:48,299
as the faster of the two but aims for

615
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,730
greater and GPU and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said resistance</font>

616
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,059
so it's far better it resisted an

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:58,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">air-tight memory feet of attacks right</font>

618
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:59,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep just said that that's great and</font>

619
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,649
yeah so if you're using this for

620
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,830
passwords key derivation you want argan

621
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:06,719
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> i right and or even if they're not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing key derivation with it if it's an</font>

624
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,850
the adversary can readily access the the

00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">rom of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu and you want to deploy I</font>

626
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,350
because it's designed to be resistant

627
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:23,939
against these sort of side channels

628
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:27,719
right so the performance is pretty good

629
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,389
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the password type</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">password hashing net and they've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

reference reference implementation and

632
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,850
they also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a nice little</font>

633
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,399
command line tool and you can go and

634
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,809
clear over and you can pump<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RAM up</font>

635
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,820
to like more round than the computer

639
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,689
designed to relieve us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that air</font>

640

<font color="#E5E5E5">about x86 optimization and things like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">penny so if you're the 128 and 256 bit</font>

example if the memory locations don't

650
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,330
implementing this one spare you know

651
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,340
specific hardware and then imposes out a

652
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,399
cork cycle paint later to try and deal

653
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,250
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they also designed</font>

655
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">done tell me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and d processor sort of</font>

656
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,349
quirks memory and memory synchronization

657
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,379
right

658
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:46,139
so they aim for being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to parallel</font>

659
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:48,389
well but for them around to increase

660
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:51,658
because we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of you</font>

661
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:54,330
know the ridiculously<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 core chips that</font>

662
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,899
AMD are making but no one's buying right

663
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:00,389
and so yet again not that draft pretty

664
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:03,449
much about that table pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much tells</font>

refuse you if you don't give it at least

672
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,529
an eight bike salt and what don't you

673
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:24,960
can see yep at the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then acumen</font>

674
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:32,879
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 byte souls but I think it goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

675
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:35,159
to 32 bytes I believe and yeah so it has

676
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:37,168
a couple of nice features tacked on the

677
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,570
end of it as well and so it's got need

678
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:42,570
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shock reasons or harsh of rhythm in</font>

679
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,729
this context is and if you have the

680
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">elation code set of thousands or fails</font>

681

that we use their last part where they

682
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:52,440
let you choose your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own key BTW the F to</font>

683
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:54,570
K and and at some point in the future

684
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,460
that iteration capable come and secure

685
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,439
so we want to we want to upgrade the a

686
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,570
recent code without having to request a

687

thousands of iterations or some random

696
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:26,969

697
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:31,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">use and you can basically compute the</font>

magic to that ship off to your server

701
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:41,908
and your server will do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for you</font>

00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:44,369
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a which again is quite useful</font>

703
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:47,030
and pull from terms of performance and

704
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:51,169
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't want to do that for</font>

705
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,670
for whatever reason right and although

706
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,130
having said that are they implement that

707
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,540
an application and not screwed up is

708
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,800
somewhat more difficult than what I've

709
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:02,810
just described and so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

710
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,120
use this instead of script well it's

711
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:07,490
much easier to parameter a parameters

712
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,639
generally you're only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be Mason</font>

713
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:13,610
with the time and the maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> around be</font>

714
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">filled buttons right and it's far</font>

715
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,110
simpler and as we discussed previously

716
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:20,900
right no script was calling like five

717
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,820
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I let need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pbk tf2</font>

718
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,980
which in turn you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> each Mac which</font>

719
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,560
entirely did<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-256 or you know</font>

720
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,410
whatever shall you using and also needed

721
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,950
salsa 20 equals well right this only

722
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,780
needs itself and Blake to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

723
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,820
actually switch out Blake to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for</font>

724
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:41,090
whatever pseudo-random function you want

725
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:43,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use and by again it was designed as a</font>

726
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,320
package and so you probably just want to

727
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,050
stick with that and unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing</font>

728
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,850
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do and again we've got the data</font>

729
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,889
independent and dependent modes as well

730
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm saying you know your client server</font>

731
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,680
handoff and your native harsh<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgrades</font>

732
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:00,290
right and the security analysis that's

733
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,380
done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and particularly because a</font>

734
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:05,420
point to write as much simpler and it's

735
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,910
much easier to crypt analyze this

736
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,330
function and Blake to be there as to

737
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:14,540
shut down eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> smax you know and we just</font>

738
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,909
saw the room XR the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH an on it right</font>

739
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:24,409
and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> as being trapped analyzed</font>

740
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:27,500
and so the this paper came out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> March</font>

741
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:29,630
a belief and and they basically figured

742
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,600
out a method where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could run art</font>

743
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:35,300
into it about four times less a memory

744
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,730
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we're at version 1.3 of</font>

745
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,050
Argan and so there will be

746
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,000
vulnerabilities and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

747
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,030
problems and your and cryptographic

748
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,190
primitives probably at some point and so

749
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,510
you will have to you know check and make

750
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,150
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running the</font>

751
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,530
current version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right so mhm i</font>

752
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,000
believe the paper was<font color="#E5E5E5"> january because</font>

753
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,040
the tweet according to my presentiments

754
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,940
was done in march so that makes much

755
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,129
more sense

756
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,899
and essentially the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

757
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:03,110
hard was that when they were fell in the

758
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:04,879
2d array and memory and rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

759
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,279
right in the previous walks they were

760
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:10,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply replacing them which introduced</font>

761
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,090
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> essential aside China which allows</font>

762
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,809
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> type memory trade-off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack and</font>

763
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:22,370
so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being kept analyzed and and has</font>

764
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:25,220
been continually improved so you can

765
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,860
pretty much use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever the hell</font>

766
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,649
one and there's bindings<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

767
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,229
basically everything and the reffing the

768
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:36,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference implementation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the</font>

769
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:39,169
github and you can if you're crazy

770
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:40,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google to see and I don't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

771
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:44,409
at sea and thought you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

772
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:48,169
the Python to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but yeah so</font>

773
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:49,960
please go use<font color="#CCCCCC"> argon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you are</font>

774
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:52,490
designing applications that take

775
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,259
passwords and or if you happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

776
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:58,250
designing a cryptocurrency you might

777
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:59,990
want to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right and so the</font>

778
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,620
last sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problem sort of great we</font>

779
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,600
now have some great memory memory hard

780
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,210
hash function for storing our passwords

781
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,389
and but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the old</font>

782
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,980
rubbish of md5 and in shower and if

783
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:17,389
you're doing something really crazy like

784
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:20,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">adobe em to the new one right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

785
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:23,060
the Gathering Hall a big shadow here and

786
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:26,598
he actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me about this steel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> con</font>

787
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:29,060
so and the python django web framework

788
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:32,149
and basically nails this you basically

789
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the old sha-1 hash then you run</font>

790
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:37,520
that through your new function so argan

791
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:41,328
to PB<font color="#CCCCCC"> kdf to and our waiver and you get</font>

792
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,310
free puppy in a bag and basically how

793
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,639
this works is when your user logs in and

794
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:49,310
you check the Argan two of the password

795
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you don't have the Argan two of</font>

796
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,929
the password you then fall back<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

797
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,359
chicken for the origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the sha-1 of</font>

798
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,190
password right so that's without user

799
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:00,470
logon so obviously once your user logs

800
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,210
and gives you the password and again you

801
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">can then just run that through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Street</font>

802
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,299
argument and eventually over time you

803
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,460
rule from have an amex to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

804
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">predominantly more and at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point you</font>

805
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:17,140
can call the time and on your old hash

806
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:20,710
function right and so yeah I think that

807
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:23,019
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where the last late yes so if</font>

808
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:36,579
anyone has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions or just general</font>

809
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:38,740
insults and please fire away oh I didn't

810
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">really look into that much and it's lest</font>

811
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,769
it is a feature and but the believe the

812
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:48,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">IFC expands with slightly more and it's</font>

813
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:51,220
not an entirely new concept I believe

814
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:53,740
argan tues the foxtrot<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement it but</font>

815
00:35:51,220 --> 00:36:02,970
and it's been sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kicking about is</font>

816
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:12,700
my dear for for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi any questions</font>

817
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:16,538
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> right well oh yeah so it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simile</font>

818
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:21,160
against using hachey<font color="#E5E5E5"> restore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

819
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:24,369
password so you will stay in the

820
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,558
scenario something he<font color="#CCCCCC"> breeds happening</font>

821
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:28,900
password is going up there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

822
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,089
scenario so most of these breeds that

823
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,309
tackle is able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the like a</font>

824
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:37,359
web server or database server and and

825
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:39,279
the database maybe he run<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hashcash or</font>

826
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,390
whatever his tool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they he cracked</font>

827
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:45,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the password but reality when be like</font>

828
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,940
consider linkedin example you have a

829
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:51,579
Logan function so even if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> harden</font>

830
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,500
200 attacker is not able to crack the

831
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:55,599
password with his haircut during the

832
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,809
proof so what will be custom rules he

833
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,180
can customize the authentication control

834
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:04,960
the way of linking function and he can

835
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,879
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you sir password equal to</font>

836
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,250
the input password equal to the half

837
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said a logo said he'll do that of</font>

838
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:14,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">his people that's a plainness so he can</font>

839
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,359
even you know he may<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to wait some</font>

840
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:18,250
time to restore it<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the data but</font>

841
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,810
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's able to</font>

842
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,570
it's a password so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

843
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:24,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what Hashem agonism they are</font>

844
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,680
you see if it is a powerful hacking I

845
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,799
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack the password I can</font>

846
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,169
same time in custom function store the

847
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,780
password printers in somewhere file or

848
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:38,020
have a voice or in so yeah do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

849
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">any better protection mechanisms in</font>

850
