33
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,990
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> does gender diversity in cyber</font>

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,490
security matter and how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I come to do</font>

35
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,640
to do this it was a question actually

36
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,619
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you asked earlier all of the work</font>

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,219
that I'm doing in gender diversity came

38
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:44,259
by chance it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very topical subject</font>

39
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:46,689
right now it's almost every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I</font>

40
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,060
openly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 there's an article on gender</font>

41
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,770
diversity inside the security or hat how

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,299
to try and get more women into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

43
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:59,499
industry for me it happened by chance i

44
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:01,450
read an ayah<font color="#E5E5E5"> c squared report and it it</font>

45
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,640
showed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of women in the</font>

46
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,079
industry globally and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,969
didn't bother me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what bothered me</font>

48
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,070
was the fact that the numbers are

49
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:11,500
decreasing year upon year that was a

50
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,420
huge concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me having been in the</font>

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry for so long I know lots of</font>

52
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,890
women in the industry so I really didn't

53
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,579
think it was

54
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,069
as bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it was and so what i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did i was</font>

55
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,370
shocked enough to write a blog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

56
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,920
spent a whole weekend writing that I was

57
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,720
absolutely scared stiff that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get crucified when I published that</font>

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,070
on linkedin but I was courageous and I

60
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,959
press that press the button<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that and</font>

61
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,640
I thought this is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> view having been in</font>

62
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the industry for so long and it is the</font>

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,799
view of an entrepreneur but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

64
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it out there and LinkedIn went mad</font>

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,420
in a good way so I had loads of people

66
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,610
commenting on the blog it's still there

67
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,290
for you to read if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to and I had</font>

68
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of people reaching out and this was</font>

69
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,489
all over all over the world and when I

70
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">did that when that happened I realized</font>

71
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:01,310
actually this was a huge issue and I

72
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,100
actually hadn't done up until that point

73
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,090
so it was asked to write more about that

74
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,440
so I wrote a big piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> for forensics</font>

75
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,030
towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,950
over Christmas time I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my</font>

77
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,430
kids for about a week and a half and i

78
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,470
thought i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do more research so I</font>

79
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,380
did that and ended up writing a 15,000

80
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">wild report on the global state of women</font>

81
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,180
in cyber security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stage</font>

82
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,360
or left foot was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font>

83
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,670
to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in like 10 and help and</font>

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,160
then something stopped me and I suddenly

85
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,160
thought this is half a<font color="#E5E5E5"> burka 15,000</font>

86
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,470
Vlad's it's half a book if I can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

87
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,329
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can interview more women and men</font>

88
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,120
in the industry and tell more stories I

89
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,709
can add more value and so I got into

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,209
LinkedIn again and put this in fact

91
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,920
actually before getting on to LinkedIn I

92
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,200
found a publisher friend and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,238
this is what I've done is it was me

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,149
doing this and she said you'd be crazy

95
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,730
not to so I then went to LinkedIn put it

96
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,500
out on linkedin everyone were<font color="#CCCCCC"> sites yes</font>

97
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,920
please do this this is going to be great

98
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,079
and then I had the the challenge of how

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,230
do I raise the funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this book</font>

100
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,260
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to publish it so I got him to</font>

101
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,119
kick a starter and did a project my

102
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,789
first project on that I raised the money

103
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,789
got sponsorship bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> america response</font>

104
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:22,760
ring and and then said about lighting

105
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,289
right in the burgh so right now the book

106
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,330
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be published at the end of</font>

107
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year by the end of the year I'm out</font>

108
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,120
there interviewing women and men

109
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:34,700
globally and the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

110
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,950
coming back is absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> fascinating</font>

111
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,729
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible so some of that I'm</font>

112
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:44,120
going to be sharing with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so</font>

113
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">put so like I said the numbers you can</font>

114
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,480
see on the graph here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

115
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,180
what the numbers are looking like

116
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,090
they're declining year upon year and

117
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,920
it's not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough the reason</font>

118
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,270
why it's so important really comes down

119
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,950
to two things the first is economics so

120
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,010
McKinsey & Co reported that actually

121
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:07,610
gender<font color="#CCCCCC"> equality would add twenty six</font>

122
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,640
percent or 28 trillion to global gdp by

123
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,800
2025 if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve that that's</font>

124
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,570
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if you can make more</font>

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">money we can do better things in the</font>

126
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,430
world we can do more<font color="#CCCCCC"> good when women are</font>

127
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,500
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any business profits to increase</font>

128
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,650
there's more production there's more

129
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,030
innovation we stay on schedule in

130
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,909
accordance<font color="#CCCCCC"> with budgets much more</font>

131
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,729
compared to the modulus teams and when

132
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,340
women are politically and economically

133
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,900
empowered societies on the stable so for

134
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,979
me that's really good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

135
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">really make much the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

136
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,870
security it's just we are another

137
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,910
industry but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance side</font>

138
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,270
when we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at our industry</font>

139
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,010
specifically this is what's key for me

140
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,680
women see risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a different way to men</font>

141
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,770
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wired differently and that's</font>

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,210
because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that we are</font>

144
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,810
whether or not we do or don't it doesn't

145
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,600
matter we see you risk in a different

146
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,720
way and when we want together with men

147
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,030
we can do a better job when it comes to

148
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,120
fighting cybercrime and actually

149
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,250
assessing what I risk posture is so for

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,400
me it's all about bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that together</font>

151
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,100
bringing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doug varsity of thinking</font>

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,929
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talent pool and working</font>

153
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,030
together so we can up our game because

154
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,900
right now the cyber criminals are

155
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,400
winning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that cannot continue and</font>

156
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,349
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a report here if you</font>

157
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,940
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this link here on a wee forum</font>

158
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,350
there's a report<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can play with</font>

159
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so you can look at the differences</font>

160
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,240
between everybody working together<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

161
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,080
we see risk and if you look at men only

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,729
how they see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

163
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting so as part of</font>

164
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,080
the book what I've come to see is that

165
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,509
really we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have five challenges to</font>

166

address with this and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

167
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">through these with you now the first</font>

168
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,110
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about developing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talents</font>

169
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,150
and whenever I talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this everybody</font>

170
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,090
always says you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into the</font>

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:07,438
school<font color="#CCCCCC"> to earlier we do have to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> schools Aria and we are if i look at</font>

173
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:15,120
the UK and they are doing some fantastic

174
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:17,129
work in in UK schools they have they

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,349
haven't enforced it yet but they have

compulsory for schools to do this and

181
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,120
until that happens we're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

they found was that sixty-two percent of

men and seventy-five percent of women

for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just give you a story here</font>

197
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,620
actually might but three kids my

198
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:17,069
daughter is 14 and she recently she had

199
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,310
to choose her GCSE options she is very

200
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:22,139
artistic and she chose<font color="#E5E5E5"> our Cheetos</font>

201
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,479
history and she also chose computer

202
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,339
science I swear there's no pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

203
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,008
me or her father who are both in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

204
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,990
industry to do that she narrow it down

205
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,339
she had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few elders like drama and</font>

206
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,130
things like that that she was teetering

207
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,870
on but she<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked those when I went into</font>

208
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,269
school she goes to an all-girl school

209
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,179
when I went into school<font color="#CCCCCC"> and her teachers</font>

210
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,190
asked her what she chosen she mentioned

211
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,829
those three subjects when computer

212
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,810
science was mentioned three teachers

213
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:51,660
pulled a face and one even leant forward

214
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,609
and she said do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I can't</font>

215
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,670
understand anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that so</font>

216
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,250
object and I leant forward having just

217
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,410
delivered a panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that morning on why we</font>

218
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,730
need more women in the industry and said

219
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,439
I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong person that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

220
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,360
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I welcome technology</font>

221
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,790
principally<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

222
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,230
why we need more women in the industry

223
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,329
it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take long literally it was a</font>

224
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,579
minute or two minutes someone she heard

225
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:16,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she said thanks so much now I</font>

226
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,180
understand where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come in and speak</font>

227
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the girls and of course I said yes</font>

228
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,359
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> has another teacher a lesson teacher</font>

229
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,040
who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool she definitely</font>

230
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,910
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like my old lesson future</font>

231
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,550
and she said when she asked her asked my

232
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,110
daughter what are you doing she said you

233
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,089
know what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should do what you</font>

234
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">laugh what gets you out of bed in the</font>

235
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,110
morning which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that I</font>

236
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,720
completely agree with she said if if you

237
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,220
do pick computer science I think that's

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">really smart because it is the future</font>

239
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,410
this is the now technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the future</font>

240
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,450
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there now and I know</font>

241
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,910
attitudes like that will change as

242
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,940
teachers get younger and they're using

243
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">consuming technology much more but right</font>

244
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things like this are going on in</font>

245
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:08,010
schools today I heard from someone in in

246
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,810
in the room about his daughter who

247
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,540
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future sighs she still</font>

248
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,819
does and her plan is to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martha for</font>

249
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,790
Google when she's older but her school

250
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,160
had had an issue with the curriculum

251
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,319
they were still teaching ICT and ICT is

252
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,760
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> into computer science the school</font>

253
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,470
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the</font>

254
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,350
school was and they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it</font>

255
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:32,149
so she wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do that so there</font>

256
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:35,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">are huge issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in schools in the UK</font>

257
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:37,410
globally is a different kettle of fish I

258
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,689
can't go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now but signing the</font>

259
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,079
book I do look at other countries like

260
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,990
India who have a completely different

261
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,569
culture and program for getting women in

262
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,990
into the education system and building

263
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,490
the pipeline and Israel as well so some

264
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,300
really exciting things actually that are

265
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:00,390
being done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in both those countries and</font>

266
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,670
let me look at universities we have to

267
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,230
build the talent now so if you can work

268
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,360
on the school's get them into the

269
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">universities that</font>

270
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,029
great where we are now go is that

271
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,479
universities are failing by and<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

272
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:16,970
the students that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time I'm</font>

273
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,829
mixing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs that she says will tell</font>

274
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,450
me they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not prepared they're learning</font>

275
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:22,310
out of date technology if they are

276
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,500
learning technology it could be 10 to 15

277
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,390
years out of date it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case of the</font>

278
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,880
technology is moving so fast that they

279
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,089
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up they are not being being</font>

281
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:37,459
my elders has graduated I know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

282
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,760
it cost him and the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

not coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the workforce ready</font>

into the industry but find it really

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,810
hard I spoke to a girl the other day

339

she's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nna in intelligence she's</font>

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,460
doesn't get anywhere she's done

344
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,040
she's not getting a job offer again

345
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,690
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some many many more examples</font>

346
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,020
that I can give you both men and women

347
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,820
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just a gender issue but for me</font>

348
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,040
when we hear about stats that we have

349
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,440
low numbers of women or declining

350
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,189
numbers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an issue and it's</font>

351
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,260
unacceptable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the girl that</font>

I was speaking about a minute ago is an

355
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge is marketing and for me when I</font>

356
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,950
look at this there's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

357
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,410
going on here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first thing I see</font>

358
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,480
is that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not marketing effectively</font>

359
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,120
we're not being targeted with it with

360
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,340
our marketing coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cells and</font>

361
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,200
I same sales and marketing a business

362
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,200
development background for me I look at

363
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,850
it in terms of profiling so who do we

364
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,860
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attract what do they look like</font>

365
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,490
when they hang out how are they speaking

366
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,200
and really getting specific about what

367
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,430
they look like so we can attract

368
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,780
attracts them the with this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

369
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,000
three buyers

370
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,709
we have CISOs who have a completely

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">different need to to suppliers</font>

372
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,510
consultancies and vendors and then we

373
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:45,109
have employees so typically what happens

374
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:47,290
is CISOs tell me that they need creative

375
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,600
thinkers project managers good

376
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,099
communicators those that can mostly deal

377
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,460
with the stakeholders and the vendors

378
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,950
and then the suppliers have to satisfy

379
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,140
the sea salt so they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

380
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,180
being accredited so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the sea says</font>

381
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:06,530
we'll look in try to differentiate

382
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:08,900
between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the and then the</font>

383
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,030
employees have different needs and they

384
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:15,110
vary in accordance with whatever level

385
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:17,240
that they are so we're not doing that we

386
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,570
haven't i've never seen anything that

387
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">has gone on strategically and said we</font>

388
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:29,240
are marketing specifically to Gen Y or

389
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,800
this level or this sexy ver I haven't

390

conversations image is massively

392
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,380
important so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time when I</font>

393
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,660
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people if they don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

394
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,939
our industry and I say what industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

395
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,280
in they'll say oh you got to be really

396
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,140
clever to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and</font>

397
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,600
usually I say actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know a load of</font>

398
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,140
thick people in the industry where there

399
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,120
are many many types in in our industry

400
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,010
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a perception of being nerdy or</font>

401
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,890
being geeky of being you've got to be a

super brain to be in it this industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:08,089
so diverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so go</font>

fantastic and encryptions super brains

408
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,119
we have good communicators we have

409
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:26,149
analysts you can examine the data it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

410
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,699
so diverse and it is so welcoming and we

411
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,530
are not getting that message over we

412
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,200
have so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different faces and we have</font>

413
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,600
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large ecosystem so we're not all</font>

techies in this industry we're not

415
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,990
techies so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing a good job of</font>

416
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,630
showcasing what we look like and that's

417
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,440
even without bringing gender into it so

418
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,200
when we do

419
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,909
you approaches from a gender perspective

420
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,289
we need to show that there are women in

421
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:56,019
the industry so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you that the</font>

00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,519
next slide action so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

423
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:01,429
perception is reality so right now

424
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,250
typically with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry we know that</font>

00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:06,529
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have many women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the industry</font>

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,690

00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:11,809
lot of women off coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into our</font>

429
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:18,168
show this in a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> manner as a</font>

00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:22,940
would that would help so instead of

432
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing one women now we were to show</font>

433
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,639
there were more women there so you are

434
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,070
not alone he cares again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of how</font>

435
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:33,139
we're wired we don't particularly like

436
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,658
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand out from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the crowd unless you</font>

437
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:37,219
are come entrepreneur or rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaker</font>

438
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:40,370
and things like that which so there are

439
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,029
plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> off but typically we want to feel</font>

440
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,889
welcomed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> state stay with a hard so</font>

441
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,029
perception is reality we need to show

442
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:51,080
that there are more women in the

443
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:53,360
industry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will really help language</font>

444
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,070
is also important again like coming back

445
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,959
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that who are we targeting are we</font>

446
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,178
doing a campaign that is for men and

447
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,840
women or is it specifically for women of

448
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:05,929
the men of this generation or whatever

449
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,360
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunny in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the u.s. there's a lot</font>

of programmers language when we are

451
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about language typically we're</font>

452
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,820
talking about cyber warfare taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

453
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:20,480
the bad guys and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about if</font>

454
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:23,240
we're posting job ads we're using was

455
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,019
like ambitious leading decisive

456
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,669
competitive cyber warrior and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

457
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:32,059
all that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all language that is</font>

458
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:35,659
particularly attractive for men women

459
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,580
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this brought into context</font>

460
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:40,820
so we need to know why we why we're

461
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,009
doing this for the benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people in</font>

individuals companies countries

economies and things like that things

464
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:50,779
like that turn women on more than you

465

know talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about taking down the bad</font>

466
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,190
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> in cyber warriors know that from a</font>

00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:57,199
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research that's been done words</font>

that are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> women</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are particularly</font>

support interpersonal<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships</font>

471
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,530
complimentary so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

472
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,450
targeted with the language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

473
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,800
we're using and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that</font>

474
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,810
we're doing we need to be testing the

475
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,240
whole time because nobody has got a

476
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,610
perfect formula for this it's let's see

477
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,200
what's working as<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests let's retest</font>

478
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,639
let's retest let's retest let's get

479
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,680
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversion numbers and things</font>

480
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:27,570
that not stem I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that</font>

481
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,070
stem is not good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our industry and</font>

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,310
science technology engineering and maths

483
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:37,689
I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to evolve into</font>

484
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:39,250
steam the a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ours again I know so</font>

485
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,790
many people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our industry that have</font>

486
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:45,340
come in from fine arts background I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

487
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,550
in from art design i've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

488
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,409
industry for 19 years this November I've

489
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,659
been welcomed into it it's a very

490
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,090
welcoming industry I love it I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

491
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:58,300
passionately about it but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in with</font>

492
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:01,720
art I know there are plenty more like me

493
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:05,340
you've come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with from drama from arts</font>

494
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,220
or design or sociology or philosophy or

495
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,709
law there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many different</font>

496
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">aspects to to this and we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

497
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">much more welcoming right now we have an</font>

498
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:20,889
issue with regards to<font color="#E5E5E5"> barriers and I'll</font>

499
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,510
talk about that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later but</font>

500
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,890
we need art and one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

501
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,220
we need eyes because we need to think

502
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,380
creatively we need hackers can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

503
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,270
stairwell thinking creative creatively

504
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,640
they don't have any barriers it's just

505
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,340
like can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what we want however</font>

506
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,220
you do that in order to do a better job

507
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,520
we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

508
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,680
requires a creative thinking ability so

509
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,230
it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome in those</font>

510
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have that and some of those come</font>

511
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:55,540
from an arts background if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

512
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:58,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second most second-most degree</font>

513
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,180
actually that is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> or taken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> art</font>

514
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:04,720
in our industry it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

515
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">English literature so again I know so</font>

516
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,960
many who come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a language</font>

517
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,389
background some of them have gone into

518
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:14,690
coding or other areas

519
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:16,789
one actually when Tina's are a business

520
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,909
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business reporter reply to the</font>

521
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:23,719
writing reports and then has moved into

522
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the industry and is being accredited so</font>

523
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:28,609
we do need to welcome it more in and get

524
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,879
that creative thinking again looking at

525
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:35,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole conception issue we have to</font>

526
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:36,949
proceed with caution because again we

527
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:39,829
can be tricky as women we can be really

528
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,529
tricky and in the UK i think we are

529
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:46,519
their game lets going to say in the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

530
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:48,440
think we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

531
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,119
choose my words carefully here I think

532
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,579
it's different it's different in terms

533
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:56,869
of the world so some countries are very

534
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:58,309
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> militant with some of this</font>

535
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:00,139
they're less robust a<font color="#CCCCCC"> theme</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

536
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">came a fairly robust with all of this we</font>

537
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:06,649
can take quite a bit but this campaign

538
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:08,809
here by IBM created an uproar to the

539
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:11,029
extent that they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font>

540
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,070
women got to Twitter and were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unhappy without the hacker</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hair dryer</font>

542
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:24,320
campaign that they run so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> casar</font>

543
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:28,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">proceed with caution and but give it a</font>

544
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,570
go this the third challenge is about

545
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:33,349
standards and professional I

546
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:35,570
professionalism and this is my son my

547
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:38,599
other son he would kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he knew</font>

548
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out solo big video</font>

549
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:42,889
but anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you a story</font>

550
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:46,129
about my son so he graduated in

551
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:47,418
philosophy and that summer he got a

552
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:51,228
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-class honours degree from</font>

553
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:53,509
nottingham university he is so bright

554
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:56,239
that he took immense a test and they he

555
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:58,849
got a night he's got 1958 he was invited

556
00:23:56,239 --> 00:24:00,349
to join Mensa he doesn't say that and

557
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:03,859
again he would kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for saying that</font>

558
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:06,619
but I'm his mom so I can do that and he

559
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a job with it with a company and he</font>

560
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:11,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">was really excited about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he did an</font>

561
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:13,639
internship before graduating and was

562
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:16,489
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to go and move to chop them</font>

563
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,668
and start this job for working 70 hours

564
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:24,049
a week and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an efficiency analyst</font>

565
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:24,860
and he wasn't being developed so the

566
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,570
company

567
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,580
he knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what the business model</font>

568
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,189
was once he got there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see</font>

569
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,070
that graduates were coming and going

570
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,440
pretty pretty fast with no room for

571
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">department for him it was a dead end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

572
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,970
on a low salary away from his girlfriend

573
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,530
he was in London he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought as</font>

574
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,030
their future here I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

575
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,970
able to progress and most of all hand in

576
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,100
my notice go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in do my gardening job at</font>

577
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,200
painting the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money that I</font>

578
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,459
had before doing this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer and</font>

579
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,429
then look for a job that actually

580
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,160
excites me and can develop me with this

581
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:01,669
generation with Millennials and also the

582
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,980
generation below it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> centennial's or</font>

583
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:07,010
the gem whys and the gens ease it is so

584
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,290
important to to know thats they need

585
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,790
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need feedback if you</font>

586
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,220
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to develop them we can't</font>

587
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,639
keep them and again if you read a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

588
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,770
reports about these two generations

589
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,630
companies will be frustrated because

590
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,970
they are leaving after<font color="#E5E5E5"> two two or three</font>

591
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">years one of the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why is there</font>

592
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,740
not being developed there is also

593
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,780
another issue that's going on with

594
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,570
graduates compared to apprenticeships

595
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,809
and that is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have time to</font>

596
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it's again they have</font>

597
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,830
different needs they've got different

598
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,750
cultures one is working better than the

599
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,610
other so again it comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

600
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,070
University side of things in terms of

601
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,770
are they preparing them for the

602
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:52,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">workplace I've gone into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and</font>

603
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,139
and companies have told me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

604
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,720
graduates were not even completing the

605
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,419
application forms they didn't know how

606
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,830
to answer basic interview questions like

607
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,010
why would you like to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and study</font>

608
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,770
here that's to work here which is a

609
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,320
basic one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like come on so they're</font>

610
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,290
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being prepared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the wild</font>

611
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,040
horse so back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to my son so he</font>

612
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:18,139
said so he did all this and he said came

613
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,659
back at Christmas time last year and he

614
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">said mom I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like leaving</font>

615
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,950
doing all this work looking anywhere

616
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop me and I</font>

617
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">said okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a chat about this</font>

618
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,760
so don't hand in your notice whatever

619
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,080
you did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand in you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice and let's</font>

620
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see day let's figure</font>

621
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,149
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and I said what</font>

622
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,380
about these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

623
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,720
he wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn he wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be with</font>

624
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,730
good thinkers in an environment that

625
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,400
would develop him he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hire lots</font>

626
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,950
of lots of money he wanted to have a

627
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,430
family at some point and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> around for</font>

628
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:57,140
his his children and he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very he's a</font>

629
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,870
very good thinker and he's a very good

630
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,730
communicator and he's very all-round

631
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,500
actually so he's very skilled in tons of

632
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,350
the stem side of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> formats and</font>

633
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">physics and all of that and and the</font>

634
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">English quite unusual oh she but he did</font>

635
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,760
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had this conversation and I</font>

636
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,770
said well what about our industry what

637
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,230
about cybersecurity he said absolutely

638
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,570
no way so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a degree in in IT</font>

639
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,730
and I said like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue people</font>

640
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,570
like you are needed so he said okay

641
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about it and I said</font>

642
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,899
he said how how would I get into it how

643
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,850
would I start how would I progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

644
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,310
knew you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a techie I knew that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

645
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a Penta so he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not not like</font>

646
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:40,280
that and so for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would be much more</font>

647
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,379
management or consultant I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

648
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,030
tell him or that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like and I thought</font>

649
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,280
okay right fine I've only been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

650
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,139
industry for 18 years let me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask</font>

651
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,170
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> see so friends what does it look like</font>

652
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,850
and they can tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> either and I</font>

653
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,890
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they can't tell me and I</font>

654
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:58,100
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why needs to remain flexible</font>

655
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:01,160
but the issue that we have is if we are

656
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,919
competing for hot talent we need to be

657
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,930
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some root there to be able</font>

658
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to explain it and show what it looks</font>

659
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:12,140
like because we're out there competing

660
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:15,200
with law with with like an honest with

661
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:19,190
law with banking with potentially

662
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,580
teaching and accounting we need to pull

663
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,110
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in those are kids who have</font>

664
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,149
transferable skills you can come and

665
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,060
work in our industry we don't want them

666
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,830
to have them counting is a dying it's a

667
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,960
dying sector it's been replaced by

668
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,120
technology let's get them into tech

669
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,560
let's get them into cyber security but

670
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,090
in order to do that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

671
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,620
to show what it looks like

672
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,480
accreditations are a huge issue there is

673
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,550
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place for accreditations</font>

674
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,520
but right now I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do feel like it</font>

675
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,649
is the tail wagging<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dog there's such</font>

676
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,330
an issue with job

677
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,090
some things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so there's a big</font>

678
00:28:53,330 --> 00:29:00,139
emphasis on accreditations again when I

679
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,639
spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the ma graduate I had her</font>

680
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,800
saying to me do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that I should</font>

681
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,950
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a cissp course and I said</font>

682
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely no no way if there's a point</font>

683
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't have any experience it's a</font>

684
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,130
waste<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your time and it's a waste of</font>

685
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">your money the other thing with that is</font>

686
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,870
that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those who have been</font>

687
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry for four or five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

688
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,949
so it's not serving the partners in

689
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,320
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> employers looking at these</font>

690
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,960
these things all they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see is</font>

691
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,060
someone who's who's got qualifications

692
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,830
but hasn't got the experience so<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font>

693
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,260
the time that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't going to get</font>

694
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,939
any further on then I get a little bit

695
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,830
further up the ladder in terms of an

696
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,360
interview but most of the time they're

697
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to get anywhere so it's a</font>

698
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,560
waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time doing things like that but</font>

699
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,000
it invariably graduates and people

700
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,129
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into the industry or</font>

701
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,840
finding it hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job will ask me</font>

702
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:56,630
should I go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an accreditation</font>

703
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,810
challenge ball is recruitment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font>

704
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,760
recruitment again all of these are huge

705
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:05,149
challenges but there are some quick wins

706
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,680
that we can become<font color="#E5E5E5"> made with recruitment</font>

707
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,590
there are three stakeholders we have

708
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,090
recruitment agencies and I don't think

709
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are any recruiters in this</font>

710
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,350
audience are there any recruiters in New

because usually there are and

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,840
recruitment agencies what can I say

714
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,030
about them there are a few that are good

715
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,129
usually it comes down to individuals and

716
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,410
usually I can name them on one hand I'm

717
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,440
sad to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's usually the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">being lazy they doing keyword searches</font>

721
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,490
how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I get asked about</font>

722
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,950
coming to their pen test or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company I</font>

723
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,200
built pen testing company I've managed

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:52,430
pen testing teams I am NOT pen tester

725
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,590
and with my LinkedIn profile says that

726
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,660
no it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like come on Toby an</font>

imbecile go read my LinkedIn stop being

728
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,520
lazy and so I can throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that back at</font>

729
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,080
them and I'll also throw throw it back

730
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,809
at their managers why have you not

731
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,519
taught them

732
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,019
to do this properly and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

733
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,059
there are a few that are good and there

734
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:11,830
are some companies I'm hearing more than

735
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">others who are doing a better job but</font>

they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a better job it's it's</font>

737
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:20,769
it's terrible the second stakeholder

738
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,379
really are human resources so most of

739
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:26,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time when I speak to CISOs they will</font>

740
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:28,449
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that human resources get in way</font>

741
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,100
they block they'll say I've got a window

742
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of opportunity here in like three months</font>

743
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,949
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> help and very occasionally I</font>

744
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,480
speak to HR pilots who are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

745
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,249
job and I have come across a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

746
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,600
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the book but most of the</font>

747
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:42,940
time they're blocking they are

748
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,730
incredibly powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they are not</font>

749
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:49,299
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to do the job that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

750
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,980
and then we have hiring managers hiring

751
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:54,100
managers typically haven't been taught

752
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,990
how to how to hire and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to interview and really if you want</font>

we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make inroads so just to</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is but this is she know</font>

770
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:59,889
what that is the beauty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this every</font>

771
00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:02,049
time I say it is every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say it it</font>

772
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:04,899
exposes several things it exposes

773
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:08,279
unconscious bias and it's a reference

774
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">points so think is nineteen percent of</font>

775
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Surgeons in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK or us I'll have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

776
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">check figures but it's roughly about</font>

777
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,360
that so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time our reference</font>

778
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:17,180
points are surgeons on our men so it's

779
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,879
no wonder that we

780
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,010
like that I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this at all so to</font>

781
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,230
so many and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many bright people and</font>

782
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,020
that the creativity that comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

783
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I said oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just so much fun for</font>

784
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,600
the other thing that it demonstrates his

785
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:35,030
diversity of thinking and that's what's

786
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,340
needed if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> up our game then</font>

787
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:40,160
your answer is just as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much right as</font>

788
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,500
yours we need that diversity of thinking

789
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,150
and usually what I find when I ask this

790
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,130
is there are the reference points

791
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,350
according to gender and that does dip

792
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:51,380
that is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercourse with the</font>

793
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,699
countries involved but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also can show</font>

794
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,830
the difference between a tech more

795
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,980
technical thinker and a more creative

796
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,480
thinker that's what's beautiful about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

797
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,980
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this industry</font>

798
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:06,500
so no no wrong answers this is what we

799
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,750
need so when everyone's banging on about

800
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,130
equality and things like that we

801
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,860
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want at the moment we've</font>

802
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,510
got inequality with this fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> pitcher</font>

803
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,790
here where everyone standing on boxes

804
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,280
little pass and can't see over can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

805
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the game then we have got a solution</font>

806
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,860
whereby and a couple of boxes stacked up

807
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,320
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little person is is the</font>

808
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:30,590
minority of a woman they can see over

809
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,930
what we have insecure insecurity in our

810
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:36,440
industry is we have an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> where by a</font>

811
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:39,440
lot of men are feeling bypassed because

812
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,060
there are the metrics or the goals and

813
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,590
targets because more companies are

814
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,380
saying we've got a forty percent or

815
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,940
thirty percent goal or target to

816
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,240
increase gender diversity in the

817
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,770
workforce and some men are feeling

818
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,500
bypassed and then some women<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

819
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,929
thinking I got that because of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

820
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,780
merit<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because I'm a woman so don't</font>

821
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:03,230
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me thinking like that so we have</font>

822
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,420
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really challenging workplace issue to</font>

823
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,490
solve right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after is the</font>

824
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,230
third box when nobody feels they're

825
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,149
getting special attention and what we

826
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,010
have is best person for the job because

827
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">whilst I go on about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this gender</font>

828
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,120
stuff on women in the industry what I'm

829
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,830
really trying to do is help the industry

830
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,230
help me indistinct<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature it's still</font>

831
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,330
really young it's new it's been born

832
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:26,030
from IT and by doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'll get more</font>

833
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:30,319
women into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry this is a people</font>

840
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,460
when it comes to recruiting for jobs a

841
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,900
lot of talent is there but some are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

to her why have you not put<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

857

859
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,860
it's it's nice cybersecurity I don't do

860
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that she said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the skills</font>

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,680
process and she did get the job so for

864
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:42,110
us out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there when we're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

865
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,109
talent it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about being vigilant it's</font>

866
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:48,200
about looking really at the skills that

867
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,120
we need instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking at by 12 to</font>

868
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,910
three years experience in some cases we

869
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,620
don't need that some places we do for

870
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,529
what can we do in terms of supporting

871
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,779
and developing that talent internally

872
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,540
just like when I talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my friends</font>

873
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,790
who've been in the industry for who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

874
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,980
in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> forties that's let's say and I</font>

875
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,250
say to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> look we all came into this</font>

876
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:12,020
industry roam around our 20s we got in

877
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,360
we were welcomed many in the industry

878
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:17,540
got in with a few qualifications a few

879
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,150
lousy grades and they're in top

880
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:22,190
positions now why are we putting the

881
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,080
barriers up when we need talent when got

882
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,480
a shortage supposedly of talent why

883
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,009
we're putting the barriers up why we not

884
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,450
looking this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this in a more</font>

885
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,280
comprehensive way and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do that</font>

886
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,160
through through methods through things

887
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,300
like blind auditions through processes

888
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,960
and through technology so blind

889
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,660
auditions are really interesting as in

890
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,510
really seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shorts at that</font>

891
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,569
music program that's on son I TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

892
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:55,060
they do blind auditions and they all

893
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:57,040
sweetly got will.i.am he's that the boys

894
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then they do that so they cant hear</font>

895
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,720
the singer they don't know what they

896
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,320
look like but all they can hear is the

897
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,569
sound so do go like a sound there was a

898
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,180
there was a survey done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes</font>

899
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and they</font>

900
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,560
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced that they weren't</font>

901
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:18,430
recruiting based on gender when they put

902
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">up a curtain in between so they couldn't</font>

903
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,839
see who they were actually recruiting

904
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,609
all they could do was hear the music

905
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,520
they increase the numbers of women in

906
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:29,410
New York astre by<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty-five percent</font>

907
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were</font>

908
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">convinced that no they won't do another</font>

909
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,560
to lead and that oh it's just about the

910
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">music thirty-five percent increase you</font>

911
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:43,779
can do things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in our industry</font>

912
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:45,490
quite simply so<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenged fight is</font>

913
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,500
about the wild place culture and this is

914
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:51,790
the hardest and this is going to take

915
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:54,099
years to change so we have Howard and

916
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:57,480
Heidi Howard and Heidi Rosen is a case

917
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:00,210
study that's taught at Harvard and

918
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,310
essentially what what we have is

919
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,650
students are presented with<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the two</font>

920
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:09,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">individuals they're both in fact there</font>

921
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:13,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one person the person is is Heidi the</font>

922
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:16,210
real person<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Heidi a real life example</font>

923
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,849
but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Weber is</font>

924
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">powered or Heidi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is highly networked so</font>

925
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,440
build company before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're</font>

926
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,480
friends with Bill Gates they used to

927
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,839
know Steve Jobs they sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> boards</font>

928
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,820
they're a pretty awesome amazing person

929
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:33,700
when the students are asked to rate

930
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,720
either one of them how it is someone

931
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,109
that they want to walk with he's

932
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,839
competent and efficient and amazing but

933
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:42,359
with Heidi they don't like her they can

934
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,320
see that she's confident but she's not

935
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,240
they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to walk that they don't</font>

936
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to employ her I don't like her she</font>

937
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,959
comes across as being selfish and what

938
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:54,279
their demonstrates is that in most cases

939
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,930
leadership is still being viewed

940
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:01,720
as a male and male things when they're

941
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,180
not supposed to be nurturing and there

942
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,200
can't be competent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> likeable at the</font>

943
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:11,470
same time so it's we have that issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

944
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,230
to address which will take time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

945
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:17,020
me what I say is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really where I</font>

946
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:21,190
think we are now so when I stand up at

947
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,170
events and present i'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a</font>

948
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,810
woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> that builds a seven-player global</font>

949
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,430
penetration testing company I don't

950
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I'm a woman that did</font>

951
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:33,250
that I'm a person but and in here's an

952
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,280
example the reason that I do is not to

953
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:38,710
be arrogant or boastful or anything like

954
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,170
that is to show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is possible I'm</font>

955
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">standing up as a woman saying you can do</font>

956
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,970
this too it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what your sex</font>

957
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,160
is and being a role model and

958
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,689
approachable role model as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

959
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,450
there are many women<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there in our</font>

960
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,330
industry who are not visible and if they

961
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:57,640
are visible<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are not helping people</font>

962
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,319
whether it's men or women out there in

963
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,210
the industry so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I get</font>

964
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">approached a mentor and so many times I</font>

965
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,850
I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who say well you've</font>

966
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,220
replied to me that's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you I</font>

967
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:12,009
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you would why would I not</font>

968
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:14,919
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not acceptable so we need</font>

969
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:18,130
visible role models and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> women to</font>

970
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,740
show that we are in the industry we also

971
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,690
need more mentoring and sponsoring so

972
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,450
the mentoring can help with development

973
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,970
and the sponsoring can actually help

974
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:31,270
with getting them into into jobs so

975
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:33,850
again challenging and say I've got a job

976
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you or I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who is let me</font>

977
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:41,589
introduce you because like that can

978
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:44,860
really help so what next ok well there's

979
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:47,260
loads to do so there are 4 i'm pretty

980
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,090
much wrapping up here there are four

981
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,980
important shifts that are happening for

982
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">us and these are going to happen over</font>

983
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:57,070
the next 10 years the first is that

984
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to advance at speeds</font>

985
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:03,670
that you have never<font color="#E5E5E5"> witnessed before and</font>

986
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:05,580
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about this by 2025 we're</font>

987
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,340
going to have five billion people online

988
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,190
seventy-five percent

989
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,660
from emerging countries markets and

990
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,650
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 billion</font>

991
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:17,270
connected devices technology will

992
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,220
technologies will increase we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

resources and applications can be built

999

because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will enable enable us</font>

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,950
to work in different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1001
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,380
theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is happening an</font>

1002
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,790
atom sectors on the markets we're going

1003
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,730
to be working more on project by project

1004
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,020
basis we could be walking by the hour

1005
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,640
look at it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be competing with</font>

1007
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,529
interesting environment that we're going

1008
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:58,130
to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in artificial intelligences is</font>

1009
00:42:54,530 --> 00:43:00,230
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming and machine learning so</font>

1010
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,350
we had the diaper challenge in the

1011
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:06,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">States the other week so interesting I</font>

1012
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:08,720
find it fascinating I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do but it's</font>

1013
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,970
also a threat to us so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1014
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,640
important is that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of that</font>

1015
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:16,700
and we carry on learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings me on to</font>

1016
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,160
the second point education is going to

1017
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:22,149
grow our needs our need for growing so

1018
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,430
by 2025 we're going to have 262 million

1019
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,620
enrolled students at universities all

1020
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,000
around the world and let's get a lot of

1021
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,490
them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come from enlarging</font>

1022
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,700
markets like China and India we're going

1025
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,700

1027
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:46,359

00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:49,190
free many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them will be massive online</font>

massive online courses we're going to

1030
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:56,270
have so many different learning methods

1031

and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to walk we're</font>

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,420
auditory or visual we're going to be

00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:11,450
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to satisfy them in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way and do</font>

1037
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:16,430
a better job<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analyzing what their</font>

00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:26,160
merging markets I think it's 16 million

1041
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:30,480
by 2025 that's that's I to me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1042
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,560
like wow it's incredible to think me

1043
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,609
that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:37,020
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> emerging markets by in terms of the</font>

1045
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third shift is all to do with</font>

1046
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:45,300
demographics<font color="#E5E5E5"> our longevity so by 2025</font>

1047
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">815 million people will be over 65 years</font>

1048
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">old so at the moment we have developed</font>

1049
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,420
countries who have declining birth rates

1050
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,150
due to increasing female educational

1051
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,790
personal choice and enhanced child metal

1052
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,260
medical provisioning we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> aging</font>

1053
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,230
populations so people are living longer

1054
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and some of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are going to be</font>

1055
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,170
reliant we're going to be retiring and

1056
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,140
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be reliant on people</font>

1057
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:12,930
working and then some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them would also</font>

1058
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,250
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because their pensions have</font>

1059
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,160
been affected due to the financial

1060
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,990
crisis so we have a big issue with

1061
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,259
regards to this and in a world place

1062
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:24,118
it's gonna change the culture because

1063
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,310
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be out there</font>

1064
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:29,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">having to or just look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after our</font>

1065
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:31,020
children but look after I aging parents

1066
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,420
as well so the workplace<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

1067
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,970
have to adapt in order to satisfy that

1068
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,170
because you've got more older people and

1069
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:40,140
the emerging markets<font color="#CCCCCC"> they put the</font>

1070
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:43,410
reverse so they have high birth rates

1071
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,270
and more working adults so when you

1072
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,640
bring all these things together along

1073
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:50,430
with the last shift which is about

1074
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,859
globalization the world is more

1075
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,890
joined-up if by 2025 we're better

1076
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,810
connected we are consuming and

1077
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:59,430
developing low cost and thrifty

1078
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:01,230
innovation that is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1079
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,839
these emerging countries so that we can

1080
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,750
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things faster and cheaper and then</font>

1081
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:09,240
we've got India and China growing these

1082
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:12,090
massive talent pools the other thing

1083
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:15,689
that we have is an issue with resources

1084
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:19,140
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have an issue with consumption of</font>

1085
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,490
resources and as a result the costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1086
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase and people aren't</font>

1087
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,709
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be as as mobile so we're going</font>

1088
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,000
to be slightly more isolated but we're

1089
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to work because we're</font>

1090
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,640
connected so all of these all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

1091
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are coming and what's in</font>

1092
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:38,330
is that you're aware of those because

1093
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,990
they too have to know where you are now

1094
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:45,770
and to know what's coming can affect the

1095
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:49,250
choices that you make I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

1096
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:52,820
now really<font color="#CCCCCC"> where's something that I want</font>

1097
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:55,160
you to imagine having hired what I would

1098
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:59,140
have said today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really want you to</font>

1099
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:04,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine a world where by we are not</font>

1100
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:08,750
looking at people based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on gender on age</font>

1101
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:10,910
and ethnicity well we actually look at

1102
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,310
people there's been people because why

1103
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,759
whilst I talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> gender</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

1106
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:26,450
we're to move and change things then men

1107
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,520
men are the key for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we have</font>

percent of our industries man things

1110
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,490
aren't going to change unless that

1111

unless the guys get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> board and when</font>

a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> working environment it's</font>

1115
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,609
going to be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more fun with women in</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really want you to imagine a</font>

1182
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:21,980
company and stay so it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

school then but they had a they were

1184
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:27,110
talents bottom so they had they were

1185
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:28,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15-minute conversations</font>

1186
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:31,480
with those that have been identified in

1187
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,980
the company as potential<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi pliers and</font>

1188
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,540
what they were picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up or was</font>

1189
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,570
actually some people were not

1190
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:41,779
approaching their managers because they

1191
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:43,370
were afraid they were too high up so

1192
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,280
it's almost side that you're near enough

1193
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:50,420
and approachable<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that i can i can do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i can do that so it is and the other</font>

1195
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,180
thing with mentoring that is really

1196
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,299
important to know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentoring is a</font>

1197
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:59,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">two way thing so I i mentor a lot that i</font>

1198
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:01,880
learn as much but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mentees as I as</font>

1199
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,129
they do for me sometimes it small but

1200
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,220
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a two-way thing so it's not</font>

1201
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:15,340
one is the Guru close of the Guru's they

1202
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:15,339
both share yeah yeah

1203
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:33,209
that culture you<font color="#CCCCCC"> love it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever please</font>

1204
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:35,129
thank you we can somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> written you</font>

1205
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so now get to let that group of</font>

1206
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:42,420
people laughing at me you raise a really

1207
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,040
good point<font color="#E5E5E5"> man so I many of them are</font>

1208
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,880
institutionalized so right now we have a

1209
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:50,160
big drive with the armed and horses get

1210
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,780
them in all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and it's</font>

1211
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I love working with in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1212
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,940
amazing fantastic skills but invariably

1213
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,190
what I all here is that out-of-the-box

1214
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,480
thinking they're so institutionalized

1215
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,250
that all they can do is take orders and

1216
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,290
follow protocol and things like that and

1217
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:06,840
there is a need for that in our industry

1218
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:09,000
but there's also i need not to so to

1219
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:12,420
challenge and think creatively and some

1220
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,390
of them can make that change and then be

1221
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:17,760
less institutionalized than others but

1222
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:19,650
it is it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to that inquiry the</font>

1223
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,390
whole stem thing if we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1224
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,970
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of pass and whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1225
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:26,430
is those from the services or those with

1226
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:28,709
stem you're going to be just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like focus</font>

1227
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,020
like that oh and then someone who comes

1228
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:33,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">in humane done after drama or whatever</font>

1229
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,590
but can think well because that's what

1230
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want we want good thinkers and comes</font>

1231
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,550
in and says it is what our and

1232
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:40,500
everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of going oh yeah didn't</font>

1233
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,050
think about that your suicide the

1234
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:46,080
example with the unconscious diets is

1235
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,880
that beauty of diversity that enables us

1236
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,119
to be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we just go for the</font>

1237
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,060
same time that's a huge issue it's it's

1238
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,730
it's a threat to us in our industry was

1239
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,460
so varied we need to be really dumb ass

1240
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:04,859
with really welcoming what's important

1241
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what you have good thinkers great</font>

1242
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:07,790
well thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>
