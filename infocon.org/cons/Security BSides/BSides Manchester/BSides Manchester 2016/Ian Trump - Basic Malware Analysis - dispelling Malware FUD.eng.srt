00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,689
goon but I've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to DEFCON</font>

free feeding frenzy by cybercriminals<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

70
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,810
want to share a really seminal event

71
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,390
that happened at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Def Con</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

72
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,299
you saw coverage anyone here go to

73
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,488
DEFCON all right good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sorry if I</font>

74
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,340
yelled at you and my role is it good but

75
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,380
it happens um so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

76
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,290
interesting because autonomous work

77
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,290
there has now come to the security pen

78
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,530
testing environment what we're seeing is

79
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,850
essentially on computers that are

80
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,970
building exploits and patching systems

81
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:53,450
autonomously now the fact that it was at

82
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">DEFCON and there is a 22,000 handies</font>

83
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,100
roughly and more attendees was really

84
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,269
important because this sent a very

85
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,650
powerful message to nation states that

86
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,150
the united states now have the

87
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,370
technology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Canadian by the way</font>

88
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the United</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> States has the technology</font>

89
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,989
to retarded swing hoc networks now the

90
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,420
good news is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is a pen</font>

91
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,880
tester badass novel writer who are those

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,310
people in the audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no one puts</font>

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,340
their hands up thats good bop stack

94
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,880
y'all but the point here is is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

95
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font>

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,300
message saying listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are building</font>

97
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,570
the capability to unleash how on a

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,280
nation-state adversary<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay autonomously</font>

99
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,800
so it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind now</font>

100
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,659
the good news is is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine went up</font>

101
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,940
against some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those skilled hackers</font>

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are allowed to travel to the United</font>

103
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,580
States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> news here was that</font>

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">they soundly takes this machine's ass</font>

105
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we're not in a situation where</font>

106
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine won against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the humans yet</font>

107
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,230
but they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up against IBM Watson</font>

108
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,890
now this was presentation was designed

109
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,720
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> engage and talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware but my</font>

110
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,570
opinion is backed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the numbers from</font>

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the FBI our biggest problem in cyber</font>

112
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,040
crime hasn't anything to do with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

113
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,470
folks you would think from you know

114
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,780
Gavin's presentation this morning you

115
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,050
would think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about you don't</font>

116
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,330
ransomware denial service this stuff in

117
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,250
red that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but look at what our</font>

118
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,810
top victims are at least in the United

119
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,310
States non payment on delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay ah</font>

120
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,230
419 overpayment that's where i sent you

121
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,910
a check and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep some of the</font>

122
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,270
check to test to make sure your bank

123
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,430
accounts working identity theft and

124
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,310
auction certainly identity theft as a

125
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,160
result of malware okay but the biggest

126
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,720
loss is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here now at auction is</font>

127
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,900
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put a picture of a tractor</font>

128
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,750
up you pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it and then i will resent</font>

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,400
you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tack tractor so one of the</font>

130
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,310
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really interesting whoops</font>

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,679
let's go back is we're seeing a trend

132
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,870
where business email compromised that's

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,840
the hackers asking nicely for you to

134
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,210
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> money okay no malware really used</font>

135
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,789
in this type of attack so when you think

136
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the security stock the technology</font>

137
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,230
piece that's designed around

138
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,150
anti-malware one of the biggest things

139
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,910
that we could do collectively to win

140
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,280
against cyber criminals is do that user

141
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,870
security awareness training because user

142
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,849
security awareness training doesn't just

143
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,610
work inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business it works in the</font>

144
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,320

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,210
building excellent business bunkers but

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,640
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the home pcs and</font>

152
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,960
to the media hysterical reporting around

<font color="#E5E5E5">Brad somewhere think about the</font>

individual experience of Brad somewhere

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,500
what is it it's generally how do you

156
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,500
think it's a brick through your car

160

compromise is now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sure the</font>

161
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,390
other problem that we have with these

162
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,040
statistics is that are you really going

163
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,750
to call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police and file a police</font>

164
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,330
report for something that's considered

167
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,900
right you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even get a police</font>

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,720
constable of once your home is broken

169
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,929
into so i would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably</font>

170
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,710
the ransomware issue is underreported

171
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:35,320
overall so which brings us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how are we</font>

172
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,659
going to combat this<font color="#CCCCCC"> fight well we have</font>

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,820
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move away from sensationalism who</font>

177
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,400
initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was what 3.2 million</font>

178
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,229
dollars for the ransom and then when

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,109
somebody looked up how much an actual

180
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:58,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost it went down to 17 grand</font>

twenty thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ransomware</font>

183
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,040
these are the sensational things that

184
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,610
were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in general what is</font>

185
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,340
the cost of a ransomware attack 150 200

186
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,720
300 dollars right the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost now</font>

187
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,030
there's in cleanup costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some other</font>

188
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,970
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that a couple of problems</font>

189
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're having is we're having</font>

190
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,350
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation by to the top</font>

191
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,169
security researchers at Kaspersky that

192
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,570
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the problems with attribution</font>

193
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:30,460
to finish the argument on attribution

194
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,010
I'll just say it right now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

195
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people qualified to do attribution is</font>

196
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,150
the various Department of Justice's

197
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,419
because once they have enough

198
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,728
information to lay down they can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

199
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,260
court and the court will actually say

200
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,410
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think these are bad people</font>

201
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,380
right the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had is we have</font>

202
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,360
a lot of administrative talking heads in

203
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,540
the media that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pin things</font>

204
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,639
on the Russians because it's politically

205
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,099
convenient to do so and that the

206
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,260
attribution again is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to</font>

207
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the other thing that we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">especially in the small/medium business</font>

209
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:11,109

210
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:13,570
from like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco and from verizon they</font>

talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise struggles but are</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the small/medium</font>

213
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,138
business experience and what is the

214
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,319
difference the bottom line difference

215
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,449
between an SMB SME getting attacked by

216
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,880
cybercriminals is it's an

217
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,969
extinction-level event potentially for

218
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it is not an extinction-level</font>

219
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,639
event for Lockheed Martin right and we

220
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,010
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about Titan rain the attacks</font>

221
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,790
that went on now close to what 15 years

222
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago we're walking mark got breached as a</font>

223
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,010
result of the RSA hack and they lost

224
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,310
hundreds of millions of dollars in

225
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:54,040
intellectual property<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they are not</font>

226
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,500
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business so that's something to</font>

227
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,630
consider so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do some</font>

228
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,550
malware research<font color="#E5E5E5"> really basic malware</font>

229
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,910
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> where is the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place to find</font>

230
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,310
out where it's sewing content sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

231
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,290
so this is one of those slides I like to

232
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,029
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up if you're on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

233
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,699
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at things like drive-by</font>

234
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,490
downloads with hopefully a vehement not

235
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:17,349
your actual own PC these are great

236
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,449
places to find malware and script based

237
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,120
attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript injections and</font>

238
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:25,719
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this which absolutely tells</font>

239
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,209
me that preventing users from going in

240
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,670
places like this with their work pcs and

241
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,888
with their home pcs is probably in the

242
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,260
best interest of all of us that perhaps

243
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,810
don't like you know getting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

244
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,709
call saying hey something's renamed all

245
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:44,439
my files to loc KY on the end of them

246
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:47,380
what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

247
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,290
place to actually find malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also</font>

248
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,640
email not surprising these are some

249
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,760
stats that just blew my

250
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">line that 93% of phishing emails contain</font>

251
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,620
around somewhere pal right so if you

252
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of mail gateway</font>

253
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,920
filter and you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> an unpatched</font>

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,720
old exchange server or send mail<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

255
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,750
you're just asking for a world of pain

256
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so really if you're in front of</font>

257
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,740
your customers or business and you want

258
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,740
to make a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more of an</font>

259
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,630
investment in security mean email at the

260
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,960
perimeter some sort of filtering device

261
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:26,750
or into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud first and grab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

262
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,420
actually funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> story--</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here office 365</font>

263
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,570
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google are getting a lot better at</font>

264
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,969
detecting malware embedded into emails

265
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a lot better I mean you know one</font>

266
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,390
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of five okay it's not exactly a</font>

267
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,370
tremendous amount so here's the threat

268
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,330
actor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

269
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:50,090
time you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that this was delivered</font>

270
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,120
bought by a visual<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic script so the</font>

271
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,120
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes in malware if this is</font>

272
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to be delivered by a visual</font>

273
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">basic script what is the exploit the</font>

274
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,800
exploit is the human the exploit is the

275
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,089
human that perhaps wasn't paying

276
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,250
attention during security awareness

277
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:11,300
training or in the last presentation

278
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:13,910
about enabling macro content<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

279
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,490
this is where we as security

280
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,949
practitioners rely too heavily on our

281
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,330
technology stack and you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

282
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,170
different layers that this threat

283
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:27,470
bypassed right and essentially it hos

284
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,170
the end point with ransomware<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so my</font>

285
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,420
point is this is the number one takeaway

286
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,540

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,430

this is a great example look at number

reiterate it the reader it reiterated

finally to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where major vendors</font>

we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been left out okay so apple</font>

install itunes which sir dishes lee

these 20 de advisories came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple's</font>

the install base out there has quicktime

clear and present danger which kind of

IT depressions why we drink too much

possibly why we don't get enough

exercise a whole bunch a personal

343
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,550
reasons go into that the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

344
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,310
to look at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

since<font color="#CCCCCC"> four Reds where it's a free</font>

347
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,040
aware of the organization's lack of

348
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,230
investment in security now I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

349
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,140
recommend pointing the finger saying I

350
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,029
told you so when it happens but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

351
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into a constructive dialogue</font>

352
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,100
about this kind of stuff and say well it

353
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:40,670
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot worse and here's why</font>

354
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,279
right so look at it as an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

355
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,040
also think that cybercriminals really

356
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,680
enjoy ransomware because they know that

357
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">they could actually end that business</font>

358
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,290
and it is more profitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them to</font>

359
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,969
revisit that business occasionally maybe

360
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,130
every six months they have a little

361
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,660
outlook reminder saying hey we should go

362
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,130
and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys have cleaned up</font>

363
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,189
their rents aware and tighten their

364
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,740
security from last time so that's the

365
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to approach this the</font>

366
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,029
other thing that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we</font>

367
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,490
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand fundamentally how</font>

368
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:16,010
malware gets on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and it's not</font>

369
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,990
magical okay it all has to do something

370
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,260
has to exploit a system vulnerabilities

371
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,600
for a user vulnerability for access it

372
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,810
has to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing has to install some</font>

373
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,640
code in the system memory modify the

374
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,800
registry or w live for persistence

375
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,110
generate network traffic to command and

376
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,550
control node possibly drop files on the

377
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,399
system although there is violence

378
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,529
malware and run an encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> protest</font>

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,110
against your files if if the payload

which were pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly in the SMB</font>

381
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,050
SME space is going to be some sort of

382
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,930
ransomware attack if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing the</font>

383
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,520
above it's not malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's a</font>

384
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,649
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to keep in mind when</font>

385
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,010
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at malware and</font>

386
00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:00,740
specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber kill chain</font>

387
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,689
brought to us by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lockheed Martin so I</font>

388
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,669
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this a little</font>

389
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,980
bit so that you understand when we're

390
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:10,579
picking apart a piece of malware where

391
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,520
we can see the opportunities and look at

392
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,849
what is failing at our business now I

393
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,569
tend to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that recon or weaponizing</font>

394
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,458
unless you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> big dollars to get</font>

395
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,470
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like dark trays for a threat</font>

396
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,839
Intel feed for type of squatting or

397
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,789
something like that recounted

398
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,190
weaponization aren't things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

399
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:33,070
really do much about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

400
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:36,370
all happening how they're in the cloud

401
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,039
or whatever we call it but delivery

403
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,110
resulting actions we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do something</font>

404
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,750
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have tools and</font>

405
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,729
technologies that belong that part of

00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,340
about that situation so that this slide

410
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,950
is up here to suggest you that we should

411
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,129
not become demoralized but in fact we

412
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,620
have odds are the opportunity to

413
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,929
interdict the malware using a variety of

414
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">different technologies in each of these</font>

415
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,580
categories and some of them do overlap

416
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,799
and we'll talk about what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

417
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,230
with seven-time<font color="#E5E5E5"> Grammy award-winner</font>

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,360
mentioned the hacking team hack right

421
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:35,200
well look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pricing on how</font>

422
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:39,668
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 days go for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were</font>

425
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,649
numbers and now we know what they were

426
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,770
selling this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for we understand the</font>

427
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,320
relationship between the cost of these

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,650
down the road of criminality okay and

437
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,658
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's a direct</font>

438
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,370
correlation between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what hacking team</font>

439
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:27,120
build and to what we're

440
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:30,340
here in terms of the exploit so this is

441
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,379
recording futures data eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

442
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,649
the exploit kits that are in use today

443
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,500
are targeting adobe flash either

444
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,260
unpatched or zero games so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our</font>

445
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,200
first lesson uninstall adobe flash and

446
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:48,340
we have a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent defense</font>

447
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,740
against attacks attacking adobe flash we

448
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,659
have a few internet explorer attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,340
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ten percent and who's the</font>

450
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,940
super nerd that knows what that symbol

451
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,580
is silverlight installed by default for

452
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,309
no goddamn reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can figure out other</font>

453
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,290
than to login is Emmett to an msdn

454
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,300
portal because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody told me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

percent sure if not or not but

457
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,320
the point here is is it's lurking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

458
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,209
air on all of our machines and I can't

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,399
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out at least in our enterprise</font>

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,620
what the hell anyone would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a full</font>

461
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so I would like to get rid of</font>

462
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,270
silverlight which<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings us down to</font>

463
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:27,730
about a ninety percent defense now<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

464
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,700
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want but i really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see you</font>

465
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:33,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys is it's really funny that this one</font>

466
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,920
relatively obscure company comes up with

467
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:39,160
this kind of stuff by does this gap

468
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,650
mainstream media attention no not at all

469
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,570
and we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

470
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:47,080
effective defense than any of the

471
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:50,200
security stock we can get the far more

472
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,990
common problem that we have in malware

473
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,100
builds is malware that specifically

474
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:59,350
targets the lack of a patch<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

475
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,830
think about this we have burned<font color="#E5E5E5"> monday</font>

476
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:06,399
where i push all of my exploits that our

477
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:09,189
road to the bug bounty people we have

478
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,860
patch tuesday and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have i to pro</font>

479
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,860
wednesday where I figure out what the

480
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,260
actual patch fixed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can write an</font>

481
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,689
exploit for anyone that doesn't have a

482
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,090
patch so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

483
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,100
have matching<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is every time</font>

484
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,740
Microsoft issues out a patch it's

485
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,169
actually a blueprint for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exploit okay</font>

486
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,900
so the point here is is that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

487
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,390
catching orderly or monthly we

488
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,700
behind the times folks we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look</font>

489
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">at patching weekly our infrastructure</font>

490
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because the problem is the reverse</font>

491
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,919
engineers out there are going to build

492
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,800
the exploits or the lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a patch in</font>

493
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,050
record time because guess what they use

494
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,570
agile development like many of you dubs

495
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,610
do they all sit around saying how are we

496
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,100
going to host<font color="#E5E5E5"> people this week so</font>

497
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,370
they're all kind of doing that and it's

498
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting because this is where</font>

499
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:04,479
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> two folks making a lot of money</font>

500
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">in cyber crime and it's not who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

501
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,440
think it's not these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> there reverse</font>

502
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,820
engineering hatches all that takes is a

503
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,130
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time without a pro in a</font>

504
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,350
test lock the guys making big money are

505
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,920
the bloggers and the money launderers

506
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:20,909
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks that are really are</font>

507
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,040
really making out like gangsters so

508
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:26,740
exploit kits for<font color="#CCCCCC"> salecheap the cyber</font>

509
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,159
underground is filled with folks pimping

510
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,840
their exploit cats<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

511
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,480
really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because remember when</font>

512
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,730
we talked about commanding control ccnc

<font color="#CCCCCC">notes cyber criminals are collecting</font>

analytics about the success of their

515
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,560

516
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:50,440
they are marketing their products<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

517

other want to be cyber criminals<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

518
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,830
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things about</font>

being compiled and as you see sometimes

525
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,860
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> kits go dark right angular and</font>

fact went dark the targeting of law

stuff to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to when you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking of your defenses so exploit</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reduced</font>

the software uninstall it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it makes</font>

539
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,630
a lot of sense there's lots of good

540
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff that's free out there on the</font>

541
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,460
internet to prevent malware to prevent

542
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:55,100
ransomware I do a little bit of research

543
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,289
and look at what those tools are there's

544
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,240
also now a lot of online services that

545
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:02,450
you can upload a file that's been

546
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,190
encrypted and if it's possible for them

547
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,100
to either brute force or they already

548
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:10,700
have the key ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to decrypt your</font>

549
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:14,270
files so do everything you can to never

550
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,110
pay a ransom okay because the money the

551
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,970
decipher criminals make goes into

552
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,010
iterations of their malware to make it

553
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,740
more and more dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very</font>

much NSA for leaking a whole bunch of

about lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of great resources including</font>

your own UK government for user

560
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,770
awareness training this is the biggest

the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> stock unfortunately will</font>

566
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:00,649
let us down so again we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

567
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,600
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with Taylor Swift</font>

568
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:06,559
care and we're going to take a look at

569
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,678
an example payload of<font color="#E5E5E5"> crip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x three point</font>

571
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,240
a Rams more attack but what was

572
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,850
interesting is that it also dropped a

now want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull your credentials and</font>

578
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,679
find any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way to make a mess out of</font>

your life<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

580
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,640
saying is it once you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

581
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:41,000
ransomware incident it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue</font>

582
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,309
we restore the files we're all good no

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,330
there's a lot more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done when</font>

584
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do I are for ransom or now how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did we</font>

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of come</font>

591
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,530

592
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,199
that gets access to system with medical

593
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:17,010
records is going to monetize that attack

594
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,720
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to holding you at ransom so</font>

595
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,660
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat that I talked about</font>

596
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and we're gonna we're going to talk</font>

597
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,150
a little bit about this this was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nike</font>

598
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,920
provider in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK who got phone call</font>

599
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,110
after phone call Monday morning and

600
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,400
discovered that about 40 of their

601
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,889
clients have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> infected with</font>

602
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,950
ransomware all at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

603
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:44,760
that's known enit as a shitty day<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

604
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:48,000
so they asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some help and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

605
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,790
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of engage and help out and</font>

606
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,980
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ongoing investigation we got a</font>

607
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:57,659
hold of the Trojan that was used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

608
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:00,780
entire and it pushing it through

609
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,820
virustotal yielded a detection rate of

610
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,760
about seven out of 54 commercial

611
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,980
antivirus engines<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay not awesome and</font>

612
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,870
the hilarious thing is is that a

613
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft actually detected it and</font>

614
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:16,409
Microsoft doesn't detect so I was

615
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,680
like wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is uh this is not</font>

616
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:22,170
good um later on I'll kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the big</font>

617
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,490
reveal but I'll do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the sad thing</font>

618
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:31,020
is is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan was from 2012</font>

619
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay 2012 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 out of 54 not cool at</font>

620
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:37,980
all now later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I ran it so look at the</font>

621
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,610
dates there that's 2016 124 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> January</font>

622
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:46,970
by um i guess it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

623
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:49,530
may right we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 37 on a 56</font>

624
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,440
commercial antivirus engines to tacking

625
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's something to consider</font>

626
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,710
if your approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to security none of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

627
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,149
here are of this mindset because

628
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,190
you probably wouldn't be at<font color="#CCCCCC"> bsides</font>

629
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:03,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Manchester if you were but if your</font>

630
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,820
approach is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kidding you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

631
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:09,210
rely on like thirsty and I'm good to go

632
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,250
for security it's not good freighter

633
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,919
your odds of hitting something are

634
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,899
pretty bad because this is again keep in

635
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,789
mind a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan that delivered the</font>

636
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:21,719
ransomware payload to these end points

637
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:24,029
from 2012 so I got to playing around a

638
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,770
bit if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a little bit of</font>

639
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,270
a ransomware there are a whole bunch of

640
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,940
people up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that know a heck of a</font>

641
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:33,120
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than me check out Graceland</font>

642
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:36,809
security is a good example but I was

643
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:41,820
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rename the file to not that and</font>

644
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:43,500
then edit it and this is like using a

645
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,658
hex editor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because I'm not a</font>

646
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,120
programmer northern I stay at a Holiday

647
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:51,539
Inn last night but I just copied some

648
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,360
tax from the binary and put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

649
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:57,779
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this file where all the zeros</font>

650
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,658
were and that's how I got it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 22</font>

651
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:03,450
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 53 commercial antivirus engines</font>

652
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm not a hacker right there are</font>

653
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,740
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write this from</font>

654
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:10,649
scratched that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to put it</font>

655
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,070
through iteration and iterations of

656
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:16,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">virus total until they get something</font>

657
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,928
that passes right through their targeted

658
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,179
attack okay so keep that in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

659
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,760
anybody with a hex editor all of these

660
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">zeros in here are what excellent kids</font>

661
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,210
will use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text or extra</font>

662
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,610
binary information into to again change

663
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:35,130
those virus definitions to bypass it

664
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:38,850
also introduces some entropy in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

665
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:41,190
so that if it's encrypted binary you put

666
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,740
the entropy and now doesn't look like an

667
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,840
encrypted binary you've got you now have

668
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,809
another way of getting past antivirus

669
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sole point here is that antivirus is</font>

670
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:56,220
not particularly good so this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

671
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:59,039
as an attack do so the attack came the

672
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,679
Trojan was landed from this IP addresses

673
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,720
in a European country<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a friendly</font>

674
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,210
European country so let's be clear there

675
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,830
and then again 2012 it was a trojan

676
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,590
designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver a cryptolocker</font>

677
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:15,199
payload it wasn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> cryptolocker</font>

678
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:18,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's an important thing we had</font>

679
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a program that then called the</font>

680
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:24,710
malware from someplace else from that

681
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,780
server there and the encryption key was

682
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,610
a one-time key generator is the first

683
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,800
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did was run it and thought well</font>

684
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,719
maybe if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Saints the same we can</font>

685
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,500
just quickly write a Python script get

686
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,510
everything back<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so working with a law</font>

687
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,270
enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found different IP</font>

688
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,550
addresses using the attack and rather

689
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,800
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> put out a grandiose report about</font>

690
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,200
this the only thing we have to suggest

691
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's Russian cybercriminals was an</font>

692
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,310
IP address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the was the origin of a</font>

693
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,340
great deal of spam for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ransomware</font>

694
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,320
campaign ok so again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not rushing off</font>

695
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,360
and saying that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Russian</font>

696
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,210
cybercriminals what I am saying is that

697
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was obviously a cybercrime group</font>

698
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,260
that had a pretty elaborate

699
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,810
infrastructure that used a whole bunch

700
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different IP addresses all over the</font>

701
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:17,690
world in an attack on that particular

702
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:20,870
customer so um we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that slide thank</font>

703
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so basic malware analysis what</font>

704
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,909
are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really doing here essentially</font>

705
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's two ways to look at malware</font>

706
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis one is run damn thing and see</font>

707
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,490
what happens the other is a look at the

708
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,920
actual binary and do some really nerdy

709
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,670
stuff and I'm more of a let's just run

710
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:43,190
it and see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> so platform to</font>

711
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,170
use XP service pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 you can use</font>

file converters don't install AV on your

I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use here are Wireshark and</font>

722
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,930
something called red shot ok Wireshark

723
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,810
who here knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what wire truck is all</font>

00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,220
the hands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rooms you go hard cool</font>

725
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,780
red shot you might not have heard of it

726
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,760
but you can use anything what you're

727
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,399
looking for is something that shows you

728
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,830
the registry before the malware is right

729
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,539
and then the registry after<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

730
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:34,100
just to see what some conclusions are

731
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:38,629
here so um this was a file that was sent

732
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:41,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us and it was named as the person zip</font>

733
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,610
okay so little stealthy they're pretty

734
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,590
pretty cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you're gonna</font>

735
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,360
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that has your name on it</font>

736
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:51,549
I guess is what that what they thought

737
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,740
as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the file has a detection</font>

738
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:57,860
3556 commercial antivirus engines

739
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,690
detected you know now at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

740
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,939
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought it not so much you'll see that</font>

741
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:05,120
the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control URL is</font>

742
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,150
hard-coded hard-coded into the binary

743
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,459
and again six out of 68 web standing

744
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:13,669
engines<font color="#E5E5E5"> are only throwing out that</font>

745
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:16,549
binary or that URL as being dangerous

746
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:19,100
which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's damn dangerous I'm</font>

747
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:21,650
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit and just some stuff on that</font>

748
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,399
pulled out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more of an advanced tool</font>

749
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,460
kit that will talk about but basically

750
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,010
cuckoo sandbox shows that you know it

751
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,380
performs some HTTP crests it does

752
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,500
process injection who hears going to a

753
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:40,970
computer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked how come there's like</font>

754
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 notepads spawn in cast manager but um</font>

755
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,590
no pad is that running on the machine

756
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,880
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a sign of our because</font>

757
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,178
what they've done is they've injected

758
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are processed into notepad to to</font>

759
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,210
maintain persistence or doing whatever

760
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,030
they're doing you can also see it as

761
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:59,150
explored on<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and any sort of other</font>

762
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:02,210
app and then again it installs itself

763
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:05,510
for auto run at windows startup<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

764
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've got a short video here that I'm</font>

765
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,639
just going to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to pay I</font>

766
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:12,740
think I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> click this okay and this is</font>

767
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">just basically what we did here so the</font>

768
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:17,810
first thing you want to do is really

769
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:20,659
check out to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your network</font>

770
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:23,810
stock is working properly okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

771
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:25,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're also in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DMZ or better yet on</font>

772
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,460
an IP address that is not inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

773
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:32,899
corporate network okay

774
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:35,000
up here uh and and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your binary</font>

775
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,339
is and that's why you do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

776
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,460
research on first if it is aware of a

777
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:42,560
virtual environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're then be</font>

778
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,399
very careful because that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you blow</font>

779
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,799
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a macbook pro so first thing we're</font>

780
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,469
doing here is we're taking a snapshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

781
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,480
the VMS registry before we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

782
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:57,490
run it so there we go and that way we

783
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:01,280
can compare the compare the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and then</font>

784
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:05,299
because i'm a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a not here i'm</font>

785
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,890
going to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i know that i</font>

786
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,810
know my network stack is working

787
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:12,859
properly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm very</font>

788
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:15,140
interested here in is what does this zip

789
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:17,598
file actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do from a network</font>

790
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,049
perspective because malware will reveal

791
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,000
itself at the network layer generally so

792
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:27,800
here I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying and look at that</font>

793
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wow icmp words yay me ok and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

794
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,730
we're seeing the echoing replies which

795
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,070
is really great so we know everything's

796
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:37,250
ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go we go to our live malware</font>

797
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:40,550
and there's a few selections there but

798
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,200
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up that one this is</font>

799
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,390
other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

800
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,520
morning and check it out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

801
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,770
JavaScript so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't require user</font>

802
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,080
interaction the idea here is the zip

803
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:54,200
files received gosh she clicks on it she

804
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,270
clicks again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then nothing right but</font>

805
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,410
something so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can see what</font>

806
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:03,859
happened is it checked with dns and it

807
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:07,250
found the IP address of that server

808
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:10,098
which tells us that at one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> nasser</font>

809
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,780
was probably compromised and working as

810
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,710
the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control for the bad guys</font>

811
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:18,650
now you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice the HTTP GET request</font>

812
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I don't come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up again</font>

813
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,869
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is because I think a</font>

814
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">really short out now we're doing our</font>

815
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">second shot so we've got two things</font>

816
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:31,339
we've got the network capture and we

817
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,900
have what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we ran the</font>

818
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:35,150
binary and what it did to the registry

819
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:38,420
now let me ask you this question if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

820
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:41,060
receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a document is it reasonable that</font>

821
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,980
you would have 60 set

822
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,830
registry changes happen when you open

823
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dog right no okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz the answer</font>

824
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:51,660
including a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font>

825
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:54,810
things including a windows script call

826
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,580
right there okay so this is just one of

827
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,009
those things where if you take a regular

828
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,529
word document you open it up you may see

829
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,720
some registry changes but nothing like

830
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,490
this right so you you definitely have a

831
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,100
feeling that you've got some malware

832
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,830
going on and then here I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing a</font>

833
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,980
quick tour of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I want to go</font>

834
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:17,100
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that get request so please</font>

835
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:23,580
scroll down so we can see it thank you

836
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:26,190
okay this Geor sgod etsy is the actual

837
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,710
ransomware payload okay that is the

838
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,560
actual thing it is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download and</font>

839
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:35,250
crimp your files so that's kind of the

840
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the basic malware analysis and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

841
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,840
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'll take us to the next slide</font>

842
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,750
here because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

843
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,370

and also cover the whole Randy part of

846

around with that yeah kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool right</font>

849
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:59,640
I'm thug I'm really great for analysis

850
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:03,390
of drive-by download attacks okay bro

851
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,850

855
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,520
want to maybe go down to the packet

856

capture layer and really look at the

857
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:20,280
packets coming across the volatility is

858

869

you grow fresh p.m. absolutely and one

870
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:58,160
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

871
00:38:56,269 --> 00:39:01,098
first thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you snapshot your</font>

872
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,200
vm that's not infected first<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay kind</font>

873
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:05,930
of been other<font color="#CCCCCC"> recipe of restoring your</font>

874
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,470
vm but really good point the other thing

875
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,328
go and this is the one caution about

876
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,519
using somebody elses young for this is

877
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you'll find that you'll want to</font>

878
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,769
fine tune it so a good example is if

879
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,289
your vm has chrome installed on the

880
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:23,689
first thing chrome does when it launches

881
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:26,150
is checks with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google to see if there's</font>

882
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,589
an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> for chrome and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of apps</font>

883
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,690
are like that so you'll want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

884
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:33,710
customize your malware analysis platform

885
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:35,420
with wireshark on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine tune it so</font>

886
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,039
that you don't get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this extra</font>

887
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,950
network traffic that's going to confuse

888
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,170
your analysis so VM snapshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> read shall</font>

889
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:45,980
run wireshark on we infect all the

890
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,660
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> red shot to compare observe the</font>

891
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,430
Wireshark traffic trace the IP address

892
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,049
the host country just for shits and

893
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,720
giggles see where the attacks coming

894
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,210
from a post base and the restore the vm

895
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:00,230
from snapshot that's kind of what

896
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:04,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens so uh right malware dependencies</font>

897
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:07,940
so the number one thing for malware and

898
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:11,809
it's dependent on you not backing up

899
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:14,539
your pops<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so my advice is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

900
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:17,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have solid solid backups</font>

901
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:20,480
this is the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that keeps your job</font>

902
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:24,980
when everything else hits the proverbial

903
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,799
fan super important um this is a major

904
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:31,339
problem right now with malware command

905
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:34,670
and control<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress is basically the</font>

906
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:37,220
old way of exploiting a website was I

907
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put up my</font>

908
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,589
banner and I'm super cool right<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh what</font>

909
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:45,180
those cyber criminals are doing now is

910
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:47,279
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after WordPress</font>

911
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,558
site specifically to hide their

912
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,319
command-and-control to use it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> blast</font>

913
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,730
out tons of spam<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what I'm saying</font>

914
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,770
to you guys I'm pleading with you guys

915
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:59,160
here don't be part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and</font>

916
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:02,400
and absolutely if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

917
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,740
inside your organization this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

918
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,079
um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment it off in the</font>

919
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,618
network so that you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font>

920
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:14,099
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control and logging about</font>

921
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:16,890
for this box it's so bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

922
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,339
threat Intel fee just for wordpress

923
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:23,430
blogging<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute forces</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you do</font>

924
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a website a wordpress site this</font>

925
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:30,000
will tell you at least who is attacking

926
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:33,868
it in so it comes up on twitter and you

927
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,180
can follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or right there so um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> duka</font>

928
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:39,510
2.0<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this one a</font>

929
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:42,660
little bit this was these<font color="#CCCCCC"> raleys it was</font>

930
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:45,900
a pretty serious advanced persistent

931
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:48,540
threat actor type of attack it was use a

932
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,400
whole bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 days okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

933
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:53,339
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always get well if that's the</font>

934
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">case like it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 days what can we do to</font>

935
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:57,029
defend myself against<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you know</font>

936
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a not-for-profit and I have no money</font>

937
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,930
or I have a for-profit business and I

938
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,819
don't want to spend any money which are

939
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,098
the two types of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we hear</font>

940
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:08,930
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time so what's really</font>

941
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:13,380
interesting here is that the attackers

942
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:16,410
figured out servers to generally act as

943
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,119
command control and they also gated the

944
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,368
command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control through different</font>

945
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,040
protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when we think about</font>

946
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:25,290
malware and the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of</font>

947
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,808
malware we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking now about</font>

948
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,690
protocol changes for the command and

949
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">control so that we can't see it the way</font>

950
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:35,250
we could hear we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

951
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,440
command and control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over HTTPS right</font>

952
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,540
with a stolen certificate to further

953
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,599
obscures that we can't peek inside

954
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,369
without something like the burp suite to

955
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,700
do a man-in-the-middle attack however

956
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:48,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a couple of things here that</font>

957
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though this is an advanced</font>

958
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,149
persistent threat could have given up

959
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:56,990
the fact that something here was

960
00:42:53,150 --> 00:43:00,730
if we had some egress filtering<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

961
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:04,098
that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> work stations inside my domain</font>

962
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:08,240
cannot communicate directly to the

963
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:10,730
internet through DNS we would have

964
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,910
caught these guys right because one of

965
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">their tactics was descent fake tcp/ip</font>

966
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:20,930
pockets to ip8 Dottie Dottie now who

967
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,640
here can tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> when 88 days right</font>

968
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,160
pretty much everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right</font>

969
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:30,410
Google's DNS service would you be

970
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:33,529
sending IP to Google's DNS servers no

971
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:35,390
you would be sent in DNS right so think

972
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:37,819
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a number of different</font>

973
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,430
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an opportunity to catch</font>

974
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:42,770
these guys at your firewall right so you

975
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,618
have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> workstation in one VLAN</font>

976
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:48,460
segment that says DNS traffic can only

977
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:52,250
go to my active directory domain

978
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,750
controller with chives DNS on<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

979
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,640
there are opportunities to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get these</font>

980
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,720
guys the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is these IP</font>

981
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:02,450
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you when if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

982
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:05,000
some logging on your system you would

983
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:08,480
see connections being made out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

organization to these IP addresses even

985
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,279
when the humilation had gone home for

986
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,650
the day and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at your logs</font>

987
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:18,890
from say one o'clock and warrant<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

988
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:21,470
a.m. in the morning and you see browsers

989
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:26,150
that you won't have installed on any of

have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so there are ways to</font>

992
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:33,559
combat these advanced persistent threat

993
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:35,690
actors and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

994
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,390
optimistic that from the technology

995
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:40,940
perspective we actually can win against

996
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,970
these guys fairly easily we just have to

997
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> black networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and if</font>

998
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:49,430
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment our different pieces of our</font>

999
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and if we put in firewall rules</font>

1000
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,990
to catch those indications and

1001
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:56,390
compromise like DNS from a workstation

1002
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:59,180
directly in Pakistan who here thinks

1003
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,700
that's a good idea or normal no right

1004
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,370
but and who here thinks putting printers

1005
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,230
on

1006
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,080
is an awesome idea directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1007
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:10,050
internet right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because then we've</font>

1008
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,680
gets to send you anti-semitic messages

1009
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:16,680
to all your universities so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1010
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,899
really feel that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though I rail</font>

1011
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,870
kinda against that security technology

1012
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,430
stack in my presentations there's so

1013
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,680
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more we could be doing at the</font>

1014
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,899
firewall there and looking at our

1015
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,779
traffic and understanding that malware

1016
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,020
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> trained itself add the network</font>

1017
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,600
layer and one of the ways is is really

1018
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at what does business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

1019
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplish its business goals and ask</font>

1020
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:46,080
them what relevant splash and

1021
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Silverlight has for the right um so</font>

1022
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:53,819
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I leave he found a whole bunch of</font>

1025
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:05,490
messages with giant penises on them so

1026
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:09,000
that was not good for not good for your

1027
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">network security so what really do we</font>

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,040
doesn't come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is sort of the</font>

00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,200
run-of-the-mill routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> where is there's</font>

1032
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,970
lots of stuff we can do that user where

1033
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,779
this training program just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really has to</font>

1034
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:30,060
get on board if you don't want to do it

1035
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,270
or you feel that it's not good that's

1036
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,770
what interns are for you bring one in

1037
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:38,190
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you a</font>

1038
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:40,800
cybersecurity internship and your job is

1039

to execute this user<font color="#E5E5E5"> term cyber security</font>

1041
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:49,020
get experience it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> later on in</font>

1042
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,450
life they become jaded and twisted like

1043
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:55,110
the rest of us so give them a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1044
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:57,299
get jaded and twisted right again you

1045
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,340
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number one thing down here is</font>

1046
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,730
just be prepared for the technology sock

1047
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:05,220
to fail I'm not a super<font color="#CCCCCC"> gifty programmer</font>

1048
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:08,460
I cannot right now let from scratch the

1049
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:10,740
reality is nor can most of the cyber

1050
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:14,580
criminals out there a lot there's this

1051
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,359
great study that came out from from the

1052
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,180
University of

1053
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,760
it suggested that sixty percent of the

1054
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber criminals that they arrest have</font>

1055
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,160
had previous criminal history so what

1056
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,290
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it means that they used</font>

1057
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,060
to break<font color="#CCCCCC"> into cars are they used to</font>

1058
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:32,100
break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> houses they got tired of</font>

1059
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,200
being chased by dogs and they much

1060
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,720
rather work from the comfort of their

1061
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,450
living room just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the rest of us so</font>

1062
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,160
keep that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1063
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks and again it</font>

1064
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,240
goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensationalism of the</font>

1065
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:48,420
of the media are not like the lex

1066
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,890
luthor's of cyber crime here okay it's

1067
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,700
pretty low hanging fruit that's out

1068
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:56,549
there and again you're not alone there's

1069
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,310
from comptia there's great training and

1070
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:03,870
support and organizational certification

1071
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:06,390
that you can you can latch on to um the

1072
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:08,640
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that is really good is to be</font>

1073
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:11,400
aware of some of the threats and the

1074
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,560
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are coming out I like the</font>

00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">comptia smartbrief recorded future and</font>

daily Sentinel the first three

1077
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,290
paragraphs of data Sentinel are really

1078
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,730
great and then they try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell you ISO</font>

1081
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,480
now we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like business</font>

1084
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,740
this and somehow they figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to</font>

1085
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:41,399
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in there so i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> created great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

1086
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:43,740
i wrote a pamphlet you can download it

1087
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,530
goes through seven attacks it's sort of

1088
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,720
that companion guide to one of my other

1089
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,280
presentations called meaningful

1090
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,549
measurement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm getting giving up</font>

1091
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,460
44<font color="#CCCCCC"> con I'm super pumped about that but</font>

1092
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,810
this runs through all sorts of attacks

1093
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,340
stuff that you should care about stuff

1094
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:03,390
that you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to hear</font>

1095
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:05,100
about and I do i do kind of think this

1096
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,779
is what happens when marketing gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1097
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">hold of it cyber bullets are a thing</font>

1098
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:15,030
y'all okay yeah um so where are we here

1099
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:19,160
uh yeah we've got um Taylor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Smith and</font>

1100
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:22,050
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a harbinger of destruction hear</font>

1101
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,810
that so we all remember the movie

1102
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,060
hackers

1103
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:31,340
you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so filled with</font>

1104
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:33,650
awesome ah but but we do remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1105
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,290
idea that putting IP addresses on

1106
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,850
nuclear power<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants on boats and honor</font>

1107
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,490
well rigs are really anything

1108
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:43,730
potentially they can go boom is probably

1109
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:46,850
on a good idea so I wrote a piece for

1110
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:50,920
USA<font color="#E5E5E5"> Today on the future of cybercrime</font>

1111
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:53,290
and truly I believe and it is even

1112
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,270
reinforced now with the shadow brokers

1113
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:59,120
exploits what we're going to see our

1114
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:01,480
attacks could be rad to learn to the

1115
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,310
other talks honor Internet of Things

1116
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,800
infrastructure this is I now go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1117
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:09,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">my firewall slide and saying you should</font>

1118
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,470
have a VLAN for your internet of things

1119
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,509
so that you can see what traffic they're

1120
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,910
going to and what type of information

1121
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">they might be sending I think that's</font>

1122
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:21,859
really really important because you know

1123
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:27,589
we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the ship to sink as it</font>

1124
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:31,220
were so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my view of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

about our users land to when we're

1133
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:56,330
talking about egress<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally again</font>

1134
00:50:52,760 --> 00:51:00,290
endpoint stuff that even users can

1135
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:03,410
perhaps assist themselves with so um if

1136
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:06,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to we can have a discussion</font>

1137
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:08,930
around what technologies um you may need

1138
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,200
in your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font>

1139
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,370
in my view is put in a layered defense

1140
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,740
build your security stock around

1141
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,420
proactive reactive and detective with

1142
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,720
user awareness training being the most

1143
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:23,480
proactive manage it from one console or

1144
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,939
a few consoles if you have to use hosted

1145
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,190
services and scalable services so that

1146
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,400
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopt and with that I think we</font>

1147
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:34,070
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like three minutes for Q&A</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or we</font>

1148
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,790
outline we got five minutes for Q&A I

1149
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:39,220
got my yellow card there so I

1150
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:41,470
and you are there any questions and now

1151
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:43,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a little one I apologize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1152
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:46,029
any passing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might have said i</font>

1153
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:49,720
didn't use really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad words but a few</font>

1154
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:59,860
bad words right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right</font>

1155
00:51:49,720 --> 00:52:01,569
nobody's going to jail question yeah so

1156
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:06,000
it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it'd be quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

1157
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:09,640
write some continuing all those tools

1158
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,950
this is a great point so it did and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1159
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,730
blew my mind so I looked at some

1160
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:17,169
commercial antivirus software and I

1161
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:21,130
looked at into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory of it and I</font>

1162
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:23,230
saw some VMware house in the antivirus

1163
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:26,020
software I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what what the what</font>

1164
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:28,360
that makes no sense one of the things

1165
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do to trick malware that is</font>

1166
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:34,870
aware of it being in a vm environment is

1167
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:36,250
for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look and think that it's in a</font>

1168
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,830
VMware environment and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

1169
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,720
execute so you're absolutely correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1170
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:42,580
that's why a lot of folks will jump an

1171
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,770
operating system as well so if it's

1172
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:47,140
windows malware they might be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1173
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:50,230
linux for instance to obscure the fact

1174
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:52,299
that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a vm environment that is</font>

1175
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,710
trying to run and yes it will do an

1176
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,590
inventory that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually one of the</font>

1177
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:59,080
DLLs that draw was they did an inventory

1178
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:01,990
of the software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was installed and</font>

1179
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,940
it's very easy to write to code it to

1180
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:11,140
say if Wireshark is installed do not in

1181
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:15,040
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the vo yes because have to do</font>

1182
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:17,560
that yeah you could do it on windows and

1183
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:21,490
things like tripwire more expensive type

1184
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:24,549
software will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor for</font>

1185
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:27,399
registry changes and alert a good

1186
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:30,960
logging on a monitor operating system

1187
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:34,210
and I mean windows 8.1<font color="#E5E5E5"> or Windows 10</font>

1188
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,760
anytime there is a registry change you

1189
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:39,130
can have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit setting and then that</font>

1190
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,380
can be pushed to your logging or even

1191
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:44,590
you can build your own alert saying if

1192
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:47,420
you know I see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever Microsoft's</font>

1193
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:48,980
error code is you know then you know

1194
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:53,089
hurt me that that is that is taking

1195
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:55,099
place great points though for sure any

1196
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:58,970
other questions I just met olivia

1197
00:53:55,099 --> 00:54:01,790
question sure seems to reduce not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asian</font>

1198
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:03,770
and my where does he carry more about

1199
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:06,710
virtualization to most as a virtualized

1200
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:09,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">dating way with a client so nothing</font>

1201
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:16,849
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> will the window system they do</font>

1202
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:19,299
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah there's some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

1203
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:23,059
couple families and malware that arm are

1204
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:25,430
exploiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ahmet now the and breaking</font>

1205
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:28,579
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with administrative credentials from</font>

1206
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:30,319
that sandbox there's also one of the

1207
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:32,750
first things the exploit kits are

1208
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,910
designed to do is hose whatever brand of

1209
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,579
antivirus you have but keep the icon

1210
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:40,069
down in the corner um so you're you're

1211
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:43,970
right like I'm I was really trying to

1212
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it very easy to follow kind of</font>

1213
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:52,279
demonstration but in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes that's</font>

1214
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,169
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> my experience so far that if I'm</font>

1215
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,980
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what has gone</font>

1216
00:54:54,170 --> 00:55:00,380
wrong or if I suspect on that this is a

1217
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:03,530
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threat putting it through</font>

1218
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:06,200
that will will really help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1219
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:08,240
more advanced stuff absolutely that

1220
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,890
looks to see for the vmware<font color="#CCCCCC"> hooks looks</font>

1221
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,259
to see what type of software is

1222
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:18,670
installed and then says no one I'm not

1223
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to participate I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opted out brexit</font>

1224
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that joke I just hope they don't round</font>

1225
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,309
up all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadians and throw them out</font>

1226
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,930
of the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be very bad</font>

1227
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:33,140
but I'm turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a pole so that's</font>

1228
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:35,558
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good any other questions sure</font>

1229
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,558
at the back

1230
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:52,240
other than cutting and pasting um so

1231
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,790
cook yeah coo coo sandbox does a great

1232
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,890
job of generating kind of a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> rapport</font>

1233
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:59,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you can just pull out four or</font>

1234
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:00,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">five the line saying this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs for</font>

1235
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,000
command and control this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP</font>

1236
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:06,280
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you should blocked</font>

1237
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,260
or two in a business environment in

1238
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,180
general because there are strings of

1239
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,650
malware now that use tor proxies in

1240
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,200
order to get to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> command and</font>

1241
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">control so yeah there's a variety</font>

1242
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things but yeah in general</font>

1243
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I like about recorded future</font>

1244
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:23,770
is they usually give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

1245
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:27,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware IP addresses for command and</font>

1246
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:29,410
control on a daily basis so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1247
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:31,990
copy paste send to<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps copy paste</font>

1248
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:39,120
sent devil eyes gobby<font color="#E5E5E5"> they send to</font>

1249
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:47,350
deadlocks right so cool yes sir yes

1250
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:49,359
analysis yeah absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can it's</font>

1251
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:51,040
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the registry it's also in the</font>

1252
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,550
memory and one of the nice things about

1253
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,430
memory analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um if it's an</font>

1254
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:59,140
encrypted binary in memory it won't be

1255
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:03,220
encrypted so you can actually see what's

1256
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:05,710
going on so I like I said that's this

1257
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:08,620
skill set for me on memory forensics is

1258
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,840
like here right now and it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1259
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:17,020
up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sure I'm just not a</font>

1260
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:18,470
programmer anything else awesome thank

1261
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,530
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

1262
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,529
you
