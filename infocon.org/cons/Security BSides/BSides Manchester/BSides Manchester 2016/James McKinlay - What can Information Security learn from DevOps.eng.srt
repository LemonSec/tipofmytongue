contact with people so my security I've

18
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,820
always been into pulling things apart

19
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,789
and breaking them but my roots as a

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,410
career I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19 manager then solutions</font>

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,329
architect and got a break and security

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,179
whilst driving around us thinking about

23
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:04,129
when it's Who am I and you live a

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,660
completely legit life and the alternate

stay off the grid<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's they are but</font>

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,950
where the hunting team and whilst

27
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,330
driving around thought the few little

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,670
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are connected with who</font>

29
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,759
you are that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything about</font>

30
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,710
really and so I popped on our side but

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,890
that's not going to help me with the

32
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,399
tour so and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a quick look at</font>

33
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,640
my version of DevOps it's me those word

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,050
for some people and it's a cultural

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,660
movement that's been growing for a long

36
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,179
time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'll set scene</font>

37
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,590
with where I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about their</font>

38
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,750
moms then i'll throw in whilst I've been

39
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,550
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some projects to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devops</font>

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,250
ideas and two links to the information

<font color="#E5E5E5">security world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across other</font>

42
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,760
people who do something similar so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

43
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,460
introduce some of that and they will go

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,740
on to look at really how I think

45
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,780
information security<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming as here's</font>

be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> better using and the ideas</font>

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,190
behind DevOps move so and

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,190
just off just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring here yes</font>

50
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,220
disclaimer these are these are just my

51
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,819
thoughts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with them</font>

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,980
but also i'm not in their thoughts and

53
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:25,079
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> dead office</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> historian but one of</font>

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,399
the first things that got me into people

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,250
discussing how development IT operations

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,280
and information security and internal

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,390
morning often don't work together was

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:44,160
this work from jinking guy behind the

59
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:46,048
original tripwire and so in 2004 he'd

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,230
been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it since 2000 and put</font>

61
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,959
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book visual ops so quickly</font>

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,079
looking around the audience I can see

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:03:00,150
most of us were born in 2004 not always

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:03,569
guaranteed and but that's 12 years ago

65
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:09,360
so people weren't talking about DevOps

66
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:12,600
12 years ago a few how this was when I

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,730
till was becoming a very popular term

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,239
for large companies and need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

69
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,209
grip on<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going wrong in production</font>

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,549
through an authorized changes and that's

71
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,820
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the focus of the visible ops</font>

72
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:31,670
the yellow book he came back a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some more research that</font>

74
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:38,670
looks at how information security fitted

75
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,850
in the picture so at the moment devops

76
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,570
and dev seconds is sort of the bringing

77
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,030
the security element into the current

78
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:50,640
culture and wording but then invisible

79
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,350
op security when he was talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">how and security needs to get involved</font>

81
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,440
and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to police some of it they</font>

82
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,769
need to set standards and some of it

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,769
it's a really really good read and for

84
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:08,540
those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> like read I just wanted to to</font>

85
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,980
read a little bit from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the introduction</font>

86
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,519
so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly</font>

87
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this textbook</font>

88
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,130
but development projects made constantly

89
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,200
behind schedule<font color="#E5E5E5"> part because information</font>

90
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,719
security requirements is are they linked

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,610
in the project to preserve the due date

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,590
and budget the information security

93
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,330
requirements are ignored or marginalized

94
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,130
as it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the points in the</font>

95
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,859
introduction but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

96
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">been discussed for many many years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

97
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,340
was being discussed a long time for us

98
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is looking out in 2008 for it will</font>

99
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,450
go back a little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we look</font>

100
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:49,320
at culture change this is an important

101
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:54,700
book in the history as I've loading now

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:58,330
back in 2004-2005 I was working as a

103
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:02,530
security and QA elements of projects

104
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that were adopting XP and XP</font>

105
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,210
methodologies and as it says here it's

106
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,159
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> embracing change and it's about</font>

107
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,140
social changes throughout culture change

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,480
it was getting away from and the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

109
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,930
way of designing something code to get

110
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">building it long long periods of time</font>

111
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,450
before integrating things together and

112
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">then spending a lot of effort on</font>

113
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,390
patching things up ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for production</font>

114
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,940
release maybe one production of

115
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,710
temperature releasing here this was

116
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,810
about let's have a new culture

117
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduced and continuous integration</font>

118
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,260
ideas a pet programming ideas tester and

119
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,179
security bug testicle development TDD so

120
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,909
this dates back to nineteen ninety nine

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,390
so the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see flying around</font>

122
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lincoln in job adverts today in 2016</font>

123
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,820
nothing new<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventeen years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago they</font>

124
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,020
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about culture change which</font>

125
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,820
is now considered to be DevOps but we

126
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,000
can go a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit but further of it I</font>

127
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't keep going baths and but the idea</font>

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a daily build and a daily build with</font>

129
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:15,040
some testing so the precursor to test

130
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:19,810
driven development goes back to of this

131
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,690
piece is the piece that discusses it but

132
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,669
it references the work about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nt3 having</font>

133
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,759
a day in build that's enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

134
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,889
backwards

135
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,209
and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the continuous</font>

136
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:35,610
integration sign so DevOps<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously</font>

137
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:37,529
often described as continuous delivery

138
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,339
continuous integration continuous

139
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:47,099
deployment continuous integration this

140
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:49,379
is an excellent start on the advantages

141
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:52,110
of continuous integration and this was

142
00:06:49,379 --> 00:07:00,110
around the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working in a</font>

143
00:06:52,110 --> 00:07:04,619
shop that did David bills test on<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

144
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:08,269
so then the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a of bringing the</font>

145
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:11,539
words dev and ops together to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps</font>

146
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:17,429
really sorted to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> traction</font>

147
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:20,308
following this presentation in 2009 so

148
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:25,109
this is seven years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so these ideas</font>

149
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:28,889
are not new even though recruitment seem

150
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,889
to be just jumping<font color="#CCCCCC"> or leaning continuous</font>

151
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:36,240
delivery the book if you're into going

<font color="#CCCCCC">back and reading books this is the one</font>

153
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,309
of the go to books for looking at

00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:46,829
bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> looting is delivered in to move</font>

155
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:52,559
bringing development operations closer

156
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:56,989
together and moving forward to 2012 or

157
00:07:52,559 --> 00:08:00,050
four years ago this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when the security</font>

158
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:02,128
is our information security not liking

159
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:07,669
what was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it over the</font>

160
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:11,909
fence by their bond ops and also the

161
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:14,219
DevOps is about speed and scale and how

162
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,369
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we get the new featuring which</font>

163
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:20,339
rubbed up badly against the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

164
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:22,979
looking information security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop at</font>

165
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:26,279
this gate and run all these tests if

166
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:30,058
you're doing 10 20 30 deploys a day then

167
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:33,568
the old things I've worked when you were

168
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:36,120
doing two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three releases a year with</font>

169
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:38,338
information security no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked so</font>

170
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,669
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of discussion then about</font>

171
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:48,089
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we bring security into the blender</font>

172
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:51,209
now it's not everyone's style but the

173
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,480
parable the going on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fig fictional</font>

174
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,120
journey I mean work very well religious

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,240
concept that the powerful but in

176
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,960
business writing the powerful these two

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,660
large images here to quite famous

178
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,850
parables of DevOps and they both bring

179
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,760
in an information security manager into

180
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,650
the story and it's a bumpy journey<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,020
the start from a place the end of the

182
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,020
liver place and it's all down to a

183
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,150
devil's culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason for the two</font>

184
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,880
little books in the corner this is

185
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:27,180
parable for teaching business leaders

186
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,500
and that comes from things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work</font>

187
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,260
really well for the one minute manager

188
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,720
that one in particular is about not

189
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,930
doing other people's work and the goal

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,940
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about efficiencies and flows</font>

191
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,800
are making things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen the story line</font>

192
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,209
behind leaves which are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant</font>

193
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,670
to improving quality and security what

194
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,949
will pushing the production follow the

195
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:54,329
story for gold very closely and they

196
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:56,310
credited as being their inspiration<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't get the slides and you</font>

198
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,609
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a look at what</font>

199
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,859
i think is been driving the history

200
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">devops and where it touches and security</font>

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:10,320
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some really useful things</font>

202
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:13,170
proper use of get learning about vagrant

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,560
an ounce of all there are lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

204
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,199
come to some of the tools and lots of

205
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,160
others who<font color="#CCCCCC"> do these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jets you collect</font>

207
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,360

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,459
scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> uvm sons and the DevOps</font>

209
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,580

210
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:36,540
docket is very own dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux containers</font>

211
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,820
and all the extra services go around

212
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,650
tough and so it was really stretching

213
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,280
those all get a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> move unity that's</font>

215
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,680
these slides and so that's why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

216
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,439
clear kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reference</font>

218
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,520
journey and then 2016 and you may you

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,760
may have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

things at scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google style and this is</font>

222
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:14,000
a fantastic coverage of using cloud

223
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,040
computing and the different ways that

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,420
you would need different advantages in

225
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,079
different ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the vision</font>

227
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,260
they are my favorites at the moment but

228
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,800
they're only been out for a few months

229
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,920
you can pre-order the DevOps version of

230
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,170
this is to out later this year they've

231
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,990
got it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to over the seven so it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">which takes a bit of getting used to</font>

241
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,240
when we're used to whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's virtual</font>

250
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:42,350
and operations don't always tackle the

251
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:44,989
same things but they were use the same

252
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,329
tools the same word so monitoring for

253
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,399
operations it's about uptight about

254
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,620
availability it's about scale under map

255
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitoring of security it's about</font>

256

forensics it's about alerting on things

that unusual behavior things and these

258
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,430
are two classic looks on

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,130
those topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are other things like</font>

I till have incident management but you

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,740
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider I tell Vincent</font>

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,690
necessarily think of incident management

problem management the same way

269
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:31,270

277
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,550
a drop in a bit like I've seen recently

278
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,330
so I've been focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this sort of</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 13 months in my researcher and</font>

maybe usually something for Houston but

and you may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down to death so</font>

291
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:43,560
been chosen as the conflict management

tool by the NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provoke the NSA</font>

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:51,849
having helped people get to security

294
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,600
done better so they and the NSA now has

295
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,810
tools they release if you may know and

296
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:04,480
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is simple and fully open</font>

297
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:06,849
source gitane open source its own

298
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,450
project page if you're used to using

299
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,700
puppet for conflict management

300
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,810
then they will give you hardly templates

301
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,880
and reporting templates that probably

302
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:21,260
map back into the DoD sticks which I'll

303

305
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,040
generally good security much so if you

306
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,260
didn't know about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's have a look</font>

307
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:37,260
around and if you didn't know about it

308
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:39,030
mom so be needy security<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't imagine</font>

309
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,360
as they I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got the roofs in</font>

310
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:46,740
Spain would be anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here for me no</font>

311
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:51,030
but what they produce is a testing tool

312
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,010
that you can talk to using cocaine style

313
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:58,350
natural language now probably doesn't

314
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">short to l.a on the back wall but they</font>

315
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:05,940
you can set up tests that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> described</font>

316
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,380
in we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test for this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

317

must have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it must have that in a</font>

318
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,200
fairly natural language and it's taking

319
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,080
the idea of test-driven design test and

320

development feeding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hal behavior driven</font>

321

development to security testing now you

322
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,590
don't have to invent this in your bill

323
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:30,000
pipeline it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of security</font>

324
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:32,690
test it is a result supposin saw like a

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,620
hacking tool but it it connects remotely

326
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:40,170
it it'll use connect remotely it'll use

333
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,430
natural language is going to come up

334
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,230
more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in tools and in security</font>

automation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for whatever came reporting</font>

336
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:09,079

339
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,720
but they might like what their security

teams and their internal teams might

341
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,500
have to do they might appreciate just

342
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,110
how hard they have to work on their

344

a security config audit report layer to

stir and call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnels back and they</font>

for this fascinating if I was in the

you've got long relationships with big

<font color="#E5E5E5">just what type of their two reminders</font>

sort of test phases tests to check in

863
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,740
and the test your evil to include

864
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,290
security checks now what I'm seeing is

865
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,598
nothing about test design or blindly

866
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,900
security is better for passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> proper</font>

867
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are many other testing doors or</font>

868
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,480
windows up for continuous integration a

869
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult night</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer but I said</font>

870
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,440
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncommon security function</font>

871
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,109
either so I be given example that all of

872
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,839
us asked to eliminate authentication

873
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:58,848
login Mackenzie so he don't know there

874
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,430
is a brute force attack so he need to

875
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:04,430
implement a functionality like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

876
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:07,879
love McKenna so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> he need to blow up</font>

877
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:10,129
my cancer so he know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to code but he</font>

878
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,619
don't know if he's made the agreement so

879
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,720
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sound just like it now</font>

880
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:17,930
offers men<font color="#E5E5E5"> always think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a misuse</font>

881
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,089
case so they always think use cases and

882
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:23,149
they don't based on the use cases so

883
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:26,270
like misuse case or whatever that that's

884
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,790
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for now what is some question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

885
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can answer because I do know that</font>

886
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:34,099
lots of herbs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

consultancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build source fertilizers</font>

888
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:38,599
will offer training to developers she

889
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,059
stopped making sense dates over again I

890
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,250
also know that there are people are

891
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:46,160
productized that knowledge embedded it

892
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:49,970
into a knowledge base in the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

893
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,700
people have seen commercial optical

894
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:56,089
opportunities in that problem developing

895
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,950
those how to bringing loves that doesn't

896
00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:01,400
know how to trigger on a report of time

897
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,290
you can teach them<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure and</font>

898
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">our people have seen as opportunity and</font>

adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> context and we're training I</font>

900
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:10,400
think two companies but I'm not here to

901
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,559
promote them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

training of

but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a it's a vendor who is</font>

904
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopefully this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of solution like</font>

905
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:22,420
this is kind of automatic so for example

906
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:24,819
sentiment you just give the

907
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,249
functionality working needed to download

908
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:29,769
or something it will generate with a

909
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:32,379
security requirements acute from time bc

910
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:34,538
making women and mosque<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that when</font>

911
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,430
you already<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned and then security</font>

912
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:39,489
they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product called I this risk</font>

00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,828
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen yeah we have a dissolution</font>

about how to treat corporation see what

926
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:16,779
 lucky what I have seen and one

927
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:19,448
of the tools i put up on page it'll

928

latin composition some of the vendors

935
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,788
opportunism so I've seen people bringing

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mandatory set to pass and pass</font>

938
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,679
security Templars is so love you see

939
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:59,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also in the middle of the</font>

940
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:02,650
first section my<font color="#E5E5E5"> version is your denims</font>

941
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:04,959
I think when I got to about twenty

942
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,689
twelve<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the side tables and YouTube's</font>

943
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:10,689
where they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about DevOps and</font>

944
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:13,719
safe there's an awesome those guys were

945
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:17,439
discussing how to get security training

946
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:20,499
both 80 developers and tooling to that

947
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:22,390
into the chain to to help you especially

948
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:24,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that being leader he's good into</font>

949
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,770
talking a natural language

950
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:30,040
so although that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> next own custom if</font>

951
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:33,730
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any that in that you could</font>

952
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:36,070
write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own security tests in that</font>

953
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,750
and the word from<font color="#CCCCCC"> kara the Potters you</font>

954
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:41,170
look at some of his on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speaker day</font>

955
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:44,320
he has tackled this problem of getting

956
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:46,720
security requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> into tests because</font>

957
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably out there do you mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> require</font>

958
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,839
section to it so those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

959
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,690
there only 25 / mon and internal mail

960
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,580
these kind of questions they'll test

961
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,830
anymore and fail if there's anything

962
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,210
else that kind of thing prevented simple

963
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,150
stuff so if you get a copy of the slides

964
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,130
and go get up the names of people the

965
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:11,850
inspired resolution you'll find this a

966
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:14,230
lot of research they won't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

967
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,240
but first of all just quickly in

968
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,010
response to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an exorcist that</font>

969
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,629
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i still got some interesting came</font>

970
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,270
up so I can see it from that side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

971
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,040
fence and one of the things about the

972
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,990
ops is that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much cultural</font>

973
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,009
it's not just technological yeah and

974
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:31,000
certainly one of the ways that some

975
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:33,700
organizations are approaching it is that

976
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,220
they are creating dedicated

977
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:41,230
product-based teams and their including

978
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:43,589
all of the disciplines in the team's

979
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:45,850
related to a product rather than

980
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,170
departmental izing the organization and

981
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,240
then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cross feed the</font>

982
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,210
information between departments that's

983
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,370
one approach um and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

984
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,750
working for some people so it brings

985
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,220
people in at the early eight bring

986
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,720
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it the earliest design</font>

987
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,009
stages which is the important thing

988
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,919
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the problem with having</font>

989
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:06,400
development anyway my vehicle I<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font>

990
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">move up from two other day yeah well he</font>

991
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,080
won't fall out um the other thing is I

992
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to mention is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

993
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,720
know if you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> BCS is at the</font>

994
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:20,050
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the process of constituting a</font>

995
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:24,399
sea full<font color="#E5E5E5"> deficit cops at the moment I</font>

996
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:26,140
didn't I BCS<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot of fantastic work</font>

997
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,000
so if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually convened a group</font>

998
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,490
to say let's put something out to help

999
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,340
some of the leading lights in the

1000
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,709
British DevOps world are pushing this

1001
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,119
probably in the BCS but obviously the

1002
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:40,069
pcs ping<font color="#E5E5E5"> BCS they required but</font>

1003
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,690
security will be brought on board as

1004
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:45,140
