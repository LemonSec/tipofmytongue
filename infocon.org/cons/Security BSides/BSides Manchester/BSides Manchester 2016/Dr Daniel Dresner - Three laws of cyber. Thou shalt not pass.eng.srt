<font color="#CCCCCC">that attacks are causing more and more</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say is that on each case</font>

everyone causes some sort of personal

47
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,288

over the years

51
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,879
come up with various solutions and we

have catalogs of what are referred to as

some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks the problem is is</font>

56
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,849
that they tend to turn out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be rather</font>

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,319
like these magazines that start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit</font>

worship the objectives rather than the

actual rituals themselves I got into

72
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,629
some hot water about some of these

rather than look for the few

over from the good idea to doing clever

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,629
focus on that and tends to lose sight of

133
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,479
what the real problems are and how they

134

<font color="#CCCCCC">have to work and interact together work</font>

and interact together and pick up on the

sticking plasters that we have now made

in to putting your information into some

of those systems so remember the

it's actually safe to have my phone and

but there we go back to trust again so

186
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,710
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a state of</font>

something concrete we

we can achieve and say yes we are there

we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only really be happy when we are</font>

in this cybernetic cycle of movement and

with the good stuff more of which i<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,819
say later on so when the compliance

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,790
people talk about regulation they are

regulation should be but we are doing

201
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:26,519
with our systems and the interaction so

202
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,009
perhaps we could introduce some very

203
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,009
basic principles to our systems which

204
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,199
will dampen the problem and keep it

205
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:37,170
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> control keep the problem under</font>

206
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,719
control rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than focusing and getting</font>

controls that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people dance switch off</font>

209
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:47,399
because they no longer know to which

risks they are associated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

211
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,220
the more confusion that we make for

212
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,130
ourselves the more opportunities we open

213
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,170
up for other people to take advantage so

214
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,470
how about like I say some guiding

215
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,979
principles that probably is a little bit

216
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">simplistic having said that it generally</font>

217
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the organizations and the people who</font>

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that attitude and we'll do</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it that mean that the</font>

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Room it was fantastic to automate stuff</font>

289
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,390
but we keep automating things and we

290
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,070
keep automating bad things so we don't

291
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,350
actually get as far as doing anything

292
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,900
really clever as improving and taking

293
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,300
real advantage of the technologies so

294
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,569
what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could create three laws of</font>

295
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,260
some ebert and information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security that</font>

296
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:44,180
that system<font color="#E5E5E5"> principal idea that it</font>

297
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:49,490
shouldn't make things worse and actually

298
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:54,189
should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something good it should do as</font>

299
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:57,710
its told it needs to purify our water

300

lights<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay on that's the key process at</font>

303
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,280
the key thing that systems have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

304
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:13,430
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate and we have gone</font>

305
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,160
beyond the stage where we can sedately

306
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,130
detect an attack and do something about

307
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,280
it let's face it hackers are often on

308
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,680
our system they're bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> 42 up to 200</font>

309
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,140
days before we actually find out about

310
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,900
them that's a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do damage and</font>

311
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,000
a long time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to embed their</font>

312
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,490
working practices their business

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,910
processes within our business processes

314
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,860
so we need to think when we develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

315
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,670
we deliver systems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should</font>

316
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,220
protect operate and sell preserve

317
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:49,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">nevermind the controls whether it's fine</font>

318
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:53,530
whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 113 whether it's 576 pages</font>

319
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:58,480
always going back to this basic mantra

320
00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:01,670
so what might this actually look like

321
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,580
again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a concept</font>

322
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,829
album quite appropriate for me because

323
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,310
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT musical I do have more</font>

324
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:14,000

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,270
sell preserve to create a standing wave

327
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:24,160
between us and the bad guys people

328
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:27,949
frequently ask me where do they start

329
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,709
well first principle is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what</font>

330
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:33,800
your objectives are

331
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,140
and then in terms of basics you can

332
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">argue in terms of the things you ought</font>

333
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,960
to do but make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your systems</font>

334
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,150
are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> five cyber security essentials</font>

335
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,700
by little things yes of course there's a

336
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:50,449
lot more that you need to do and i can

337
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,450
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the irony of large banks large</font>

338
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,700
corporate organizations standing up and

339
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,070
boasting that they have now been tested

340
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,420
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the five security essentials but it's</font>

341
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">not whether you're tested or got a</font>

342
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,209
certificate it's what you're actually

343
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:07,310
doing and from the other end think about

344
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,130
how you would react<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a breach and how</font>

345
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,020
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would manage in those</font>

346
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,930
situations when somebody has actually

347
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,150
attacked you both from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the social side</font>

348
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">of how you will interact and do stuff</font>

349
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,310
it's all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

350
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,350
technical side as well protect operate

351
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,939
and self preserve remember those

352
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,740
principles it even fits on a t-shirt

353
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:34,390
which is more than you can say for 27

354
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,860
double<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh one sorry I'm to lose the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

355
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,930
jacket and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided I better put the</font>

356
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">trainers on because besides sent me the</font>

357
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,989
running order so trustworthiness is

358
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:55,400
something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> striving for</font>

359
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:57,800
in our systems it's almost obligatory in

360
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,530
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint presentation to talk about</font>

361
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:05,079
icebergs I normally talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> gold bugs</font>

362
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:09,020
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's a nice book and our</font>

363
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:12,079
mantra our structure our process of

364
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,089
protecting operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell preserve when</font>

365
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,730
we understand that that's when we need

366
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand take that to the press and</font>

367
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,160
there are basic things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should do</font>

368
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,709
look at the green surf code for children

369
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,530
look at the desert island standards for

370
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:28,970
small businesses take the I as me

371
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,250
standard which actually helps the

372
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,440
processes and tells not business small

373
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,290
business has not put these controls in

374
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,360
but make<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself secure I am so worried</font>

375
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,310
by the number of organizations who are

376
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,740
saying we will make 27001 easy

377
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,440
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas easy with 340 things to</font>

378
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,720
do now you won't you might get them a

379
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,270
certificate but you won't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

380
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,060
secure and this is me the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standards</font>

381
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,490
geek the standards guy telling you it's

382
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,700
a tool it's meant to achieve an

383
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,710
objective don't worship the script

384
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:05,190
worship the objective that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

385
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,740
actually reach so there are levels you

386
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,200
don't want to throw the iceberg out with

387
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:17,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seawater now that doesn't work but</font>

388
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">nevermind so standards should be like</font>

389
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,310
the Romans had<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a Roman standard if</font>

390
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,010
you remember your history was something

391
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,710
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Legion would protect at all</font>

392
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,800
costs and they would go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell and</font>

393
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:35,790
high water to retrieve it it lost it was

394
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:40,139
something they looked at if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

395
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:43,110
discovered the magazine cyber talk then

396
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,190
please look that up and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will find in</font>

397
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:51,750
there a story called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Battle of a</font>

398
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:53,670
feeding if you can find that story read

399
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,110
it you will find no reference to the

400
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">battle of freedom but you will find</font>

401
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,520
reference to these basic principles and

402
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,950
I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

403
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,870
person who knows why I have put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

404
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,430
biblical reference in that particular

405
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:12,389
point so my twin become vector to you

406
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:17,280
and this late stage of the afternoon is

407
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:19,790
this I have no numbers to put against

408
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,730
this chart but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is my belief I</font>

409
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:28,290
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is where we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font>

are in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> period of inevitable risk yes</font>

411
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,330
we want our phones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want our</font>

412
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,150
laptops and we want our tablets that we

413
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,760
want our connection and as soon as we

414
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,210
have those connections we are opening

415
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,620
ourselves up to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain degree more so</font>

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">than less care that we might take in</font>

417
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,679
downloading an app which I want to use

418
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,380
as a flashlight but then once access to

419
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,960
my photo

420
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,910
was my lists of contacts etc etc so<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

421
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,670
is something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>
