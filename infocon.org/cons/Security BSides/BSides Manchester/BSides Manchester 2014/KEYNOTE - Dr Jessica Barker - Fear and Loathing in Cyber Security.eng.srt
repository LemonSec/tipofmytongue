or when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is raising in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security</font>

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:24,350

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,840
independent consultant so I work with

57
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,000
organizations and often it is kind of

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,739
the general awareness raising starting

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,170
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board level and talking to them</font>

60
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,540
about the correct and what they can do

61
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,130
and having done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for the last kind</font>

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,349
of four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

63
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,540
thinking a lot kind of about threats and

64
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent to which we use it in the</font>

65
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,310
right or the wrong way to and engage

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,220
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web as well as my own</font>

67
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,650
organizations and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> javon said I do a</font>

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,269
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of media work and so kind of</font>

69
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,850
thing quite a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the general</font>

70
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:58,880
public and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm communicating the message</font>

71
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,410
to you always told<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the BBC</font>

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,670
producer<font color="#CCCCCC"> rings or whatever they want you</font>

73
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,400
to be kind of pitch<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your mum and</font>

74
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,290
dad or your grandparents so kind of

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,100
thinking and they were always<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the</font>

76
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:13,370
lowest common denominator and I so I've

77
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:17,478
kind of done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some new stuff and I also</font>

78
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:24,110
use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie clip of Britain watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ripple</font>

79
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody familiar on if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you not lived</font>

80
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:31,639
until you've worked with Angela return

81
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,840
but but but we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we grab operating at</font>

82
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,690
the daytime TV

83
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,780
around it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 consumer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

84
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,460
awareness-raising and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

85
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">all sorts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of consumer issues and they're</font>

86
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,359
finding increasingly that people are

87
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,620
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> and scared or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the incense and</font>

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,960
doing things online and so I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

89
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,630
them a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> this summer and doing them a</font>

90
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,969
lot of summer and what it involves is

91
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,360
open and engaging the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of real life</font>

92
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,669
problems of the general public and so

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
like summer one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was a pop-up</font>

94
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,229
shop that was like filmed and people

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,150
came in and talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their worries</font>

96
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,440
or they painting with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem what I</font>

97
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">found that loads of people were coming</font>

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,330
to me and saying I'm scared I've been

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,638
hacked I'm scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of emails I'm scared</font>

100
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,710
to use the internet and I was like what

101
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you why you spend live just down</font>

102
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,830
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told to be so people don't</font>

103
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,349
know what they're saying about but

104
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,240
they're scared and this is why I've been

105
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,740
sort of increasingly trying to think

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,900
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear so I've told you a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

107
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,410
about Who I am I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a bit more</font>

108
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,349
this might be a tad extreme and but I

109
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,560
chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> this quote obviously partly</font>

110
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:48,070
because there's a lion by peter bretter

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">thompson who is an awesome offer and</font>

112
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:55,070
fear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> loathing was the inspiration</font>

113
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,979
for this talk but also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've had quite an</font>

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,620
unusual routine into this industry so

115
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm a sociologist really is how I would

116
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,870
classify myself my undergraduate degree

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,700
in sociology and politics and I

118
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:13,310
originally wanted to be a politician and

119
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:15,580
then I work with politicians so then I

120
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">went on to do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in regeneration</font>

121
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,710
can I worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the now defunct</font>

122
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,440
Northwest Development Agency and I

123
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,020
worked mainly on social inclusion so it

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,729
was a research role and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

125
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,190
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of deprivation and</font>

126
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,008
poverty and<font color="#E5E5E5"> social inclusion however on</font>

127
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,050
from there to you that and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

128
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,789
regeneration<font color="#E5E5E5"> the differences and the</font>

129
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,310
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like clusters and networked</font>

130
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:42,710
inflation and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> role of networked</font>

131
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,550
information of regeneration that led on

132
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,289
to my PhD I didn't masters and PhD my

133
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,600
monsters<font color="#CCCCCC"> were in town</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and regional</font>

134
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,820
planning and then my PhD was in civic

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,210
design civic designers kind of the

136
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,430
design of society it says on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

137
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,430
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like a combination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

138
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,740
sociology and town planning and what I

139
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,270
was looking at was globalization<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

140
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,100
internet the idea of never ate some

141
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,599
information and kind of how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

142
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,330
changed obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last couple</font>

143
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,720
of decades and particularly what impact

144
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,570
that's had on how we how we regenerate

145
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:27,530
and a large cities and on institutions

146
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:29,330
and on individuals so I did that I had

147
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remind myself to take mine off that</font>

148
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,300
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really about I'm now</font>

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,720
actually turn it off many technical

150
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:43,980
issues with me today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my PhD and</font>

151
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,810
that was as I said

152
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,450
design and the methodology was

153
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,680
qualitative and some loads and<font color="#CCCCCC"> roads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

154
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,659
interviews with loads of different

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,450
people I was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky that I should</font>

156
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,440
go to different cities as part of my

157
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,560
research spend the time in America and

158
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,240
and saw cuts the end of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> PhD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's over</font>

159
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">four subjects and was very sick of</font>

160
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,410
academia<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where you are lose them</font>

161
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,300
talking to two people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write at least</font>

162
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,950
this and three people read it because

163
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,160
they have to because they are examining

164
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,060
you on it so I felt like I wanted a new

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,710
challenge wanted to be something

166
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">different and I was very lucky that I</font>

167
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,099
was approached by somebody and a six

168
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,080
degrees of separation and they heard

169
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,060
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my research they were setting up a</font>

170
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,349
cyber security consultancy and they

171
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,270
wanted someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who could really</font>

172
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,550
difficult spective this had a lot of

173
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,620
technical skills they wanted someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

174
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:36,659
with a more social and human and

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,159
business focus so no very lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

176
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,350
trained and worked there for a few years

177
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,120
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 15 months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago second for</font>

178
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:47,490
my own and now wears an independent

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,930
consultant so that's who I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am and and so</font>

180
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,730
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about that music so</font>

181
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">then an unusual routine and we've talked</font>

182
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,370
a little bit about that over the

183
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,189
weekends and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the important so</font>

kind of expecting a new city people with

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,990
decreasing and I also wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it</font>

186
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,630
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it explains why i have such</font>

about and empowerment and which again

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all of this and well one</font>

224
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,029
thing that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're all aware of is</font>

225
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:33,239
that human behavior in this space is not

226
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:37,360
changing fast enough we all know that

suspect that machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaves the sense of</font>

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,700
present you a bunch of academic theories

the bigger picture and the context so

248
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:34,980
that's why I took night and but to begin

262
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,949
couldn't do it all the reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear</font>

give you a migraine and a nice big thick

267
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:50,109
what is the fear<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fear primarily has</font>

268
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,839
been studied by psychology and because

269
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,290
it's always been seen as an emotion so

270
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,210
we feel a physical response to fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

271
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,670
kind of we've always understood it as

272
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,820
the sort of Darwinian fight or flight so

273
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,189
we've evolved to recognize threats and

274
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,190
to react with a physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> response where</font>

275
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,910
we either fight we either and try and

276
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:17,470
engage and fight off the fear or we run

277
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,449
away and and so it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> studied mainly</font>

278
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,670
my psychology over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last sort of 10</font>

282
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,520
and what he talks about is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

283
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,970
embedded in different kind of contexts

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,560
so it is cultural<font color="#E5E5E5"> its social it will</font>

285
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,660
vary according to the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

286
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder also is it</font>

287
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,980
now technical and that's obviously kind

288
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,570
of what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today an</font>

289
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,450
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tudor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives this sort by</font>

290
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,950
interesting is about a tiger so he says

291
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you are walking through your journal</font>

292
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,839

<font color="#E5E5E5">walking through streets of Manchester</font>

294
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,730
and you come across a tiger and you will

295
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,620
only be scared of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you have a</font>

296
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,710
cognitive map to recognize what the

297
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,790
tiger is if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what tiger is</font>

298
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,650
and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the fear that it</font>

299
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,180
represents then you might just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

it's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> big fluffy thing that you can</font>

what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and the threat represents to</font>

303
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,080
translate that interfere so that means

304
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,760
its social somebody needs to have told

305
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,100
you you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be educated in it I</font>

306
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,529
think you see where I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the</font>

307
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,720
subject if you haven't got that

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:35,130
cognitive map and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't balance and</font>

309
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,630
curiosity with the danger but then tutor

310
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,850
goes on to point out even if you

311
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,720
understand what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you respond to</font>

312
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:45,240
it will vary depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your role so</font>

313
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
if you are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person and you come</font>

all of the equipment you need to kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

319
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,310
and the skills and the training then you

325
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,499
from killing this lovely thing and so

326
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,209
long ties

327
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:29,069
feel different to just a person on the

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:30,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">street</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a guide so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a guide you can see I</font>

329
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:35,279
think the guy on the top I've decided

330
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:37,049
he's a guide the rest are friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

331
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,229
you're a guide and you come across a

332
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:42,869
tiger and you're there with people who

333
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:44,699
want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> tigers you are protected by</font>

334
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,409
other people you have the knives and the

335
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,679
guns just in case the tiger gets out of

336
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:51,119
control so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have been trained you</font>

337
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,829
have skills and knowledge you're in a

338
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:55,769
group where there's a division of labor

339
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:58,439
and there's a hierarchy and go with

340
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,329
people if you want to see this tiger so

341
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,649
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your educating the minute so</font>

342
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,968
you're explaining what the tiger is you

343
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,389
explaining the thread you explaining how

344
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:08,519
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage that so you don't feel the</font>

345
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:11,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">same fear so when I read through that I</font>

346
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,079
decided we are we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys so when</font>

347
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,789
this guy I wish were within stand with

348
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,498
the facial hair I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we aren't</font>

349
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:17,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer the house it isn't</font>

350
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:19,559
necessary how many weapons but he's

351
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:22,679
thrown<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people with weapons and he</font>

352
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:26,129
is facilitating this kind of knowledge

353
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding so that's why I think</font>

354
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:32,789
furious it's kind of a mixture of

355
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:36,179
psychological and social so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

356
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:41,399
before the idea of fewer feels so it's

357
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:44,309
anybody know what for your girls so hear

358
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,799
appeals are you will all see them they

359
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:49,560
are persuasive messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to arouse</font>

360
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,140
fear so basically as well

361
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,939
bad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wise moving is perhaps let me</font>

362
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,350
see the horrible lungs and things so

363
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,230
this year appeals on every packet of

364
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,540
cigarettes that is sold now and public

365
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,810
health messages offer my fear appeals

366
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,089
and we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of drunk driving drive</font>

367
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:11,458
safe you see seatbelts all of these

368
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:13,948
often and rely on fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> appeals so wait</font>

369
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,540
and Alan are some psychologists and they

370
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,510
looked at fear of years fear appeals

371
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,280
have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 50 or 60</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years with</font>

372
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,980
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> allen looked at over 100</font>

373
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,339
psychological articles and that were all

374
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,380
addressing your fear of heels going back

375
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,450
to nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty three and they looked</font>

376
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,340
at three concepts and look Donna<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

377
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,340
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> or perceived</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat and received</font>

378
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,080
efficacy so efficacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned earlier</font>

379
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,510
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming up and in the talk</font>

380
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,970
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficacy is about producing the</font>

381
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,100
desired outcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's about getting</font>

382
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,490
getting what you want and be motivated

383
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,709
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that and efficacy has two</font>

384
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,840
signs it is response<font color="#CCCCCC"> efficacy and</font>

385
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,160
there's personal efficacy so if you're

386
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,129
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get someone to do something</font>

387
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,350
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to show them that what you're</font>

388
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,450
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them to do is a good thing</font>

389
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will work and you also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

390
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">show them that they can't do it so it's</font>

391
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wider thing and it's a personal</font>

392
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,530
thing and but what they found overall is

393
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,260
that a sphere reveals increase in

394
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,240
strength so does resistance and denial

395
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,730
so the more we scare people the more

396
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,320
they will bury their head in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sand so</font>

397
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,860
when you're using pure appeals you need

398
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,139
to

399
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:27,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">use court now psychologist who I really</font>

400
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">like called lemon hall he looks at fear</font>

401
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:33,630
appeals but he kind of extended and the

402
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,059
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and he came up with this</font>

403
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,040
thing called and again this is why I

404
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,960
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lows extended parallel process</font>

405
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,940
model I don't know why it's called that

406
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,950
but II ppm and he and said that

407
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,470
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people to engage we</font>

408
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,080
love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeal there's a few stages so</font>

409
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,450
fiercely and when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a fear of</font>

410
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,110
feel or when weeds or see you are

411
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,240
confronted with one and we will appraise

412
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,030
it subconsciously in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways</font>

413
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will need to a couple of</font>

414
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,678
possible outcomes so basically we will

415
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">appraise the pier appeal in terms of</font>

416
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,929
severity so how bad does it seem and

417
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,540
then also we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will look at it in terms of</font>

418
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,780
susceptibility so how likely an eye to

419
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,299
be susceptible to it the more severe it

420
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,149
seems and the more susceptible we are or

421
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:27,059
we feel we are that will lead us to look

422
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,980
at the efficacy so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't convince</font>

423
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,620
people that it is that what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was</font>

424
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,090
scaring them with is bad and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely</font>

425
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,428
to happen to them they'll just shut off

426
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,500
and they won't carry on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can</font>

427
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:39,090
convince them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> AJ's a severe threat</font>

428
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,220
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are likely to be</font>

429
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:45,689
susceptible to it then they will

430
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,480
appraise how to respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and then</font>

431
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,640
how they perceive the efficacy and leads

432
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,390
to them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider whether to control</font>

433
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,330
the danger or control the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PM so if they</font>

434
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,010
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the response Ian suggested is</font>

435
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,240
rubbish<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work or if</font>

436
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,100
they think that they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

437
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,510
skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the knowledge and to engage</font>

438
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,209
with that response and deliver that

439
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:09,179
response and then they will just control

440
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,370
the fear so they'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into denial but</font>

441
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,730
if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced that the response</font>

442
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,850
is a good thing and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

443
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they're convinced but they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

444
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,070
can enact it and then they'll control

445
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,780
the danger so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this in</font>

446
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,030
terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lord selling information</font>

447
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,000
security or<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you kind of talking to</font>

448
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,770
the board about why they should and

449
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,720
improve their information security you

450
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:36,110
have to convince them that a threat is

451
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,000
real that the threat applies to them but

452
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,860
the response being sold or offered to

453
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,690
them actually is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve the</font>

454
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,100
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they have the power</font>

455
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:49,370
they have the knowledge they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:50,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">skills to a knapsack response so then 11</font>

457
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,780
for who I mentioned came up with this

458
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,670
theory he learned tested it out so one

459
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,860
thing he was looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the early</font>

460
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:03,110
1970s and tetanus was a big problem lots

461
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,790
of people were getting a tetanus there

462
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,439
was an inoculation about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

463
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,230
weren't taking up people<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't on it</font>

464
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the injection so he got my chest</font>

465

units in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to try and scare them into</font>

466
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,740
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inoculation so to begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

467
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,010
he showed them really horrible pictures

468
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,840
of people experiencing tennis ball shins

469
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,660
with lesions with all the horrible

470
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,860
things that come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from tetanus and he was</font>

471
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pleased the students already</font>

472
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,639
scared they went away saying

473
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,040
tennis is our thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should get</font>

474
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that injection but then they didn't go</font>

475
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get the injection just went off to</font>

476
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:41,270
the pub and they see aliens not being

477
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,820
scared so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got them bathroom he's open</font>

478
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,000
the pictures they look scared he then

479
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,159
gave them a map of their comfort that

480
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,380
said this is where your lecture fears

481
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,540
are this is where the library is and

482
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Help Center is and</font>

483
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,950
these are the times that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

484
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the injection and it</font>

485
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,370
increased from and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just under</font>

486
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,720
four per cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that students forgot me</font>

487
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,760
an injection the first time and they

488
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,309
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just scared to over thirty percent</font>

489
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,390
who they had a map they already knew

490
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,129
where the health center walls they

491
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,309
already knew what<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it was open but</font>

492
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,990
they were handed a map it shows from

493
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:18,260
about four percent over thirty percent

494
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going in handy</font>

495
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,390
injection so you can see he made them

496
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,920
feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threat was to the air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

497
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,360
made them feel that they were they were

498
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,880
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it but they were</font>

499
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,070
susceptible and then he made was their

500
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,260
efficacy so he made them feel like they

501
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:38,389
could control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the danger rather than</font>

502
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:42,379
just patrolling with you so via control

503
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:44,540
responses for fear control responses you

504
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,470
feel paranoid you feel scared you feel

505
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you're just got to get out you've</font>

506
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,340
got to run away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what VA</font>

507
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,390
control responses it's a psychological

508
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,010
defense tactic and so in terms of EPM

509
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,050
it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing about controlling the</font>

510
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,660
fear rather than controlling the danger

511
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,370
the more scared you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the more likely</font>

512
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,230
you are to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your head in the sand so</font>

513
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,809
the stronger as I said before the

514
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,670
stronger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thea message the fear</font>

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">repeal the more likely you are to go</font>

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:47,030
where you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to marry him he is also</font>

567
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,910
skeptical he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not particularly anxious</font>

568
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">person</font>

569
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,410
he's skeptical and cynical so why am I

570
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,000
telling you this I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going this person</font>

571
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,760
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> parks and recreation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wisconsin</font>

572
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,240
there's my shoe morn actually into every

573
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:04,200
talk that I do but also I'm telling you

574
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,920
this because psychologists live at the

575
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,280
extent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> which individual traits in</font>

576
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your level of</font>

577
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,700
anxiety a fear appeal makes no

578
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,440
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> so whether you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are an</font>

579
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,510
incredibly I'm sure special peers on my

580
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,280
nature or whether you are not anxious at

581
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,190
all it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> no difference to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highly</font>

582
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,310
respond to a fear of you'll wear it does

583
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:32,070
make a difference in terms of efficacy

584
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,810
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficacy is unaware your individual</font>

585
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,250
beliefs matter and the extent to which

586
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think you are skilled and</font>

587
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,170
knowledgeable and trained is the extent

588
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:45,810
to which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will engage in changing</font>

589
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:48,660
your behavior the theory of planned

590
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:50,179
behavior so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this give you a plan</font>

591
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,590
behavior is quite straightforward

592
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,950
basically says with human beings of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

593
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,590
other by their personal attributes and

594
00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:01,560
social norms and the sense of control or

595
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:05,610
efficacy so by a social norm its social

596
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:07,320
norms what we mean is kind of how they

597
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,240
see people around them acting and

598
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,490
behaving and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> label kind of follow</font>

599
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,710
suit then people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will pay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

600
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,000
attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> significance individuals so</font>

601
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,670
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who they think are important</font>

602
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">although and the extent to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which they</font>

603
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:24,710
an act so the relevance of individual or

604
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,910
individuals matter is the extent to

605
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,100
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are seen as important or</font>

606
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,690
knowledgeable will and have an impact on

607
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the extent to which I decide to follow</font>

608
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,460
the social norms and but it also varies

609
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,410
according to context so what my boss

610
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,850
says about work things matters more to

611
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,280
me than what my mom says about work

612
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,010
things but what my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mum says about what</font>

613
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,399
clothes I should very much more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

614
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:48,530
anyway and so all my mother things about

615
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">only nine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Madison or even what my boss</font>

616
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:55,160
thinks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> my early life so varies</font>

617
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,600
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to context and basically what</font>

618
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the theory of planned behavior is about</font>

619
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,669
is how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn intentions interactions</font>

620
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,440
and so how to make for go from thinking

621
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:09,280
something as peers to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

622
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they think is good so um</font>

623
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,460
the theory of<font color="#E5E5E5"> planned behavior is so</font>

624
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,139
absol without<font color="#CCCCCC"> love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a perceived</font>

625
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,810
behavioral controls so perceived

626
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,240
behavioral controls they turn intentions

627
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,070
interactions and it's the extent to

628
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,550
which individuals feel that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

629
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:27,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage in a behavior and this</font>

630
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,490
will be internal as I've said<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

631
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,740
expense which they think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

632
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,720
full knowledgeable they're equipped to

633
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,720
to engaging this behavior but also

634
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,330
external so there will be thinking about

635
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,680
time thinking about stressed you

636
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:45,620
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Polly's we're thinking</font>

637
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:48,140
about money and and this can have a

638
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,209
divergence so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can say I want to</font>

639
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,860
be more secure online and but then they

640
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,840
can engage in behaviors that are not at

641
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,169
all secure because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't understand</font>

642
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,169
what the

643
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:05,200
and in terms of planned behavior there

644
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,170
is little ideas around classes of social

645
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,610
norms so I talked about social norms and

646
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,860
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how they are however people are</font>

647
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,389
acting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extent to which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we might</font>

648
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,580
follow suit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's two different</font>

649
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">types that's descriptive which purely</font>

650
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,810
describe and how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be behaving</font>

651
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,750
how other people are behaving and then

652
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:26,710
there's in genetic an<font color="#CCCCCC"> injunctive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

653
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:29,860
symbols and and so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a tick</font>

654
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:32,320
or a cross or smiley face and then they

655
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,129
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same effect so</font>

656
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,450
descriptive norms my people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> told and</font>

657
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:40,360
everybody uses their mother's maiden

658
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,850
name as their password article or

659
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,500
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the news telling them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

660
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:51,850
then people will take on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior</font>

661
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,200
so if somebody goes on a TV and says the

662
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,459
vast majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are just using</font>

663
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,890
their mother's maiden name as their

664
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,890
password and then for the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

665
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">are using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their own surname as a</font>

666
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,280
password they will improve slightly and

667
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,530
they'll use them as a smooth name but

668
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,030
for everyone else they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know amazing</font>

669
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use all these</font>

670
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,820
complicated passwords there's no one

671
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,770
else there is I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use my</font>

672
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,189
mother's<font color="#CCCCCC"> maiden name so descriptive</font>

673
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,990
norms can be helpful but they're often

674
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,700
not because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just made</font>

675
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,460
everyone average out so the people who

676
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,320
are doing really really badly and we'll

677
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,720
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit better but the people</font>

678
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,899
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are above</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the line and we'll just</font>

679
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,940
lower their behavior but injunctive

680
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,640
norms enhance all that out so people

681
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,340
really like pictures so some reason

682
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:41,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">research by constantly all these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> names</font>

683
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:45,470
but shorts<font color="#CCCCCC"> at our they looked at energy</font>

684
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:47,690
consumption and what they were doing

685
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,090
looking at energy consumption members

686
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,250
and trying to get people to use less

687
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,020
energy so they measure the energy

688
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,360
consumption and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they send</font>

689
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,789
communications around saying you are

690
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,320
using more energy than your neighbors

691
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,210
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using less energy on your</font>

692
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">neighbors when they just send that found</font>

693
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,669
around of course that the people who

694
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:09,679
were using and more energy brought it

695
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:15,200
down a little bit and but the people who

696
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">were using less for it up but when they</font>

697
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,150
put a smiley face<font color="#E5E5E5"> or people who were</font>

698
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,168
using less energy those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people kept it</font>

699
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,520
down because people wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

700
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:27,080
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money fixes I think they</font>

did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the longitudinal study and</font>

702
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,250
people kept OMG do something down over a

703
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,610
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months and the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who got</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun pieces they of course improved</font>

705
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,850
their behavior because they had about

706
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:42,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">board next door who's kind of a smiley</font>

707
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:46,428
face and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted a smiley face so</font>

708
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:48,590
amazingly simple and weird and but I

709
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,330
sort of think we can use this again and

710
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,879
I wonder you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you put your mass</font>

711
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,928
wedding and you create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern in</font>

712
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">a website and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives you the strength</font>

713
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:59,150
indicator and you see it go<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

714
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:01,639
stronger to weaker a nice kind of an

715
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,950
injunctive norm and I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think if</font>

716
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,419
we can maybe start just a feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> some a</font>

717
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,260
child a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more the child or the</font>

718
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,260
raver I don't know

719
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:15,830
and apparently that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a big</font>

720
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:18,160
difference another thing I'm in terms of

721
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">receipt and received behavioral response</font>

722
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,240
intentions expressed more than once and

723
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,500
written down are more likely to lead to

724
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,540
a change in<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

725
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,690
this a lot when I am designing sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

726
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,980
training packages for organizations

727
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,150
because I know if I go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then to</font>

728
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
look at the trade in once and I get

729
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to say yes yes I'm going</font>

730
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get much better and that when I go</font>

731
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,620
away they will quickly forget about it

732
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,600
so you kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going back</font>

733
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,479
and keep getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to express those</font>

734
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,550
same intentions over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over again and</font>

735
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,170
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they kind of keep doing it and</font>

736
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,210
keep writing it down we keep coming it

737
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:59,240
out and will they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> change their</font>

738
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:01,400
behavior so I talked a little bit there

739
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,160
are energy consumption and I think imma

740
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,820
change is quite an interesting

741
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:09,560
comparison to information security

742
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:13,610
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of face a similar</font>

743
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,639
problem so when I'm talking placed on

744
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,969
some research by the American and

a big issue and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should all do</font>

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:35,389
something about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few people</font>

759
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,730
we will all recognize these as key

760
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,160
barriers and change in behavior and

761
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,930
information security so unserious me to

actually is a big problem or is it not

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I convince myself that it's not and</font>

we should be doing so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about this i was thinking about</font>

776
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,620
last night so there's a sociologist

777
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,720
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> glassner and who talked a lot of</font>

778
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,400
our culture of fear he had a book as

779
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,949
about 10 years ago more<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture of fear</font>

780
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,270
and basically says that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in</font>

781
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,189
a time where we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all just really</font>

782
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,310
really scared and blames it on the media

783
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,870
and the United says the leading a kind

784
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,820
of points up all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fear but they</font>

785
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,870
don't really under canopy which fact or

786
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,210
and how to actually change behavior and

787
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,710
I do some work with the media and I

788
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,330
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind of think about this</font>

789
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,800
when they do because I don't want to be

790
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,779
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that is just kind of</font>

791
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,820
whipping up the fear without actually

792
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,730
explaining what it means and what people

793
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do about it and so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

794
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,420
that's why actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> monsters on my</font>

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,440

803
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:32,710
and sort wonder about<font color="#CCCCCC"> snowden and NSA</font>

804
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:36,220
and gchq and the extent to which<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

bit of a barrier in terms of kind of

denial social comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> our morning and</font>

valuing risks what this report on

822
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,000

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,170
a similar problem in information

848
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,370
security people aren't used to having a

849
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,450
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different passwords they don't</font>

850
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,460
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage possibly as they</font>

851
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,990
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to engage and they're</font>

852
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,900
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicking on links and being able</font>

853
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:19,430
to go wherever they want on the internet

854
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,110
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really like suddenly</font>

855
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:24,859
having to think about the risks with

856
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:26,210
that this report<font color="#CCCCCC"> found a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

857
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,910
terms of what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to improve</font>

858
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,800
behavior and one ties in a bit i've been

859
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,440
to the smiley faces and one is the power

860
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,060
of immediate feedback and so when you've

861
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,660
got a big problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

862
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,520
delayed and where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't often see it</font>

863
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,950
or you don't see until after the event

864
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:47,000
and then immediate feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

865
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:49,129
is a really important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

866
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,970
also within quotes and the psychologist

867
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:55,370
or bluesman right and who talks about

868
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and paralysis tooth the size of a</font>

869
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,960
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the bigger problem is the</font>

870
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,660
more people will be scared and paralyzed

871
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,340
and going to denial and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing leads</font>

872
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,009
when talks about his victim blaming and

873
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,310
she says and that in terms of climate

change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of blaming</font>

877
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">empowered and so by blaming individuals</font>

878
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,590
and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making them feel mad and</font>

879
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,930
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making them feel stupid and we're</font>

00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">not changing behavior and it's something</font>

881
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm talking to steal con in a couple of</font>

882
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:29,720
weeks and I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit about</font>

883
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,430
victim-blaming because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I</font>

884
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes do it but I think we all sort</font>

885
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,740
of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

886
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:37,259
industry and we will point of users they

887
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,299
are hiring a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid we should be</font>

888
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why you act when people are</font>

889
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:46,020
very aware of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lloyds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minh</font>

890
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:48,660
says is that if it was health problem

891
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,310
climate change information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security then</font>

892
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,040
people kind of look at empowerment a lot

893
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:57,299
more so some of them contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

894
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,160
illness and doctors and medical

895
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,810
researchers will more point your finger

896
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:08,779
and hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> up saying haha you're such a</font>

897
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:11,100
big girl power that's got very nice so

898
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,470
moving on from victim blaming to

899
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:16,290
empowerment lexi talks about empowerment

900
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,959
a very clear earlier empowerment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

901
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:22,200
is stupid wheel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really important</font>

902
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and empowerment is something that has</font>

903
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,310
been looked at even in technology in

904
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,020
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of community psychology so looked</font>

905
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:32,430
at as like a collective thing in a

906
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:36,020
community and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've got a quote there</font>

907
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:39,060
by Rappaport I just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying nothing</font>

908
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:41,040
empowerment<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a process and by which</font>

909
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,070
people organizations and communities

910
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,779
gain mastery over their affairs and I

911
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,280
think that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important quote in</font>

912
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,150
terms of information security because

913
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,700
there's about what we want and so

914
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:56,190
empowerment varies according to context

915
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,399
and empowerment is about being inclusive

916
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:02,640
rather than blaming individuals and it

917
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,230
is about it contains a community

918
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,879
psychology they look too late<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot in</font>

919
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,970
terms of health and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of mental</font>

920
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">health and wrap up or talk a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

921
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,649
how you can combine prevention with

922
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,180
empowerment because of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

923
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information such as you were</font>

924
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,629
pointing out the things that people

925
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,339
shouldn't you do it and it sounds like

926
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fun</font>

927
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,610
mentally opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an empowerment so</font>

928
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,350
how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell people not to do loads</font>

929
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,900
of things at the same time is telling

930
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,880
them but you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so it's quite</font>

931
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,470
a tricky thing to balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

932
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,920
empowerment in community psychology

933
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heavier competence building a</font>

934
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,110
confidence-building i think is something

935
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">we come across a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot in information</font>

936
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,850
security and but it's very individual

937
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:44,810
focused whereas empowerment in about the

938
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:46,790
kind of bigger picture and sociologists

939
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,740
called Zimmerman smoothie amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

940
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:52,070
yet and but Zimmerman talks about

941
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:55,189
empowerment and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stairs and that</font>

942
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:58,400
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive and the more you're in</font>

943
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,990
control the more you're engaged and the

944
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,150
more responsibility you have the more

945
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,470
empowered giraffe so Zimmerman looked at

946
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:07,100
a mental health<font color="#E5E5E5"> and support group and</font>

947
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,740
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who were just</font>

948
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">attending did not feel at all empowered</font>

949
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,120
and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> harder for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

950
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,580
change their behaviors and but people

951
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,200
who and we're offering some level of

952
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,910
support for a little bit more likely to

953
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,890
change their<font color="#E5E5E5"> behaviors people who had a</font>

954
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,080
formal role or more likely to change

955
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,790
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> behaviors really suffering some</font>

956
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,240
support and the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who were leading</font>

957
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:33,560
for the most empowered so when I am

958
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,609
delivering training is raising and one

959
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,230
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always try and get the</font>

960
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,460
organization to do at the same time if

961
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,230
they haven't already is having a

962
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,670
governance structure and to think about

963
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of how they are governing</font>

964
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,880
information in the organization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

965
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,500
different roles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody will have</font>

966
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,880
because everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes to have a role</font>

967
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,700
everybody likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that as opposed</font>

968
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,560
to be doing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they have a role</font>

969
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,399
they are more likely to act and in the

970
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,400
way that you're telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

971
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:07,489
so recommendations so in terms of

972
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:11,299
recommendations I've talked a lot about

973
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:13,339
different theories to spend just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

974
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:14,839
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes pulling out and what I</font>

975
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">think are the most important facts</font>

976
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,558
because I realize I've talked a lot of

977
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:20,239
theory and so empower as well as prevent

978
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,119
me from feel that they can engage in

979
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,190
these from being offensive and

980
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,630
communication matters so we in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

981
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,279
communication there's a few things that

982
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,130
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of each different</font>

983
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:33,410
and I get two different bit of research

984
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,470
that I've talked about and so vivid

985
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,788
language and consequences and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

986
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,339
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in getting people to change</font>

987
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,979
their behavior being visual so showing

988
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:44,029
people pictures like going back to

989
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:46,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">Leventhal and the pictures of people</font>

990
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:48,680
with the compulsions and with the

991
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:49,999
lesions and people really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make pictures</font>

992
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,538
for the more visual you can be in

993
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:57,078
communication the better and being

994
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:59,329
personal so instead of saying and there

995
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:01,309
is a huge danger out there you face a

996
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:03,529
huge danger so just translating that

997
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:07,130
into how it impacts on the individual

998
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:09,019
and I'm not passive so I often wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

999
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,759
rather tame user it's a very kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1000
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,129
passive Tim it's not empowering it's

1001
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:15,859
like using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no</font>

1002
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">control and so I don't know what better</font>

1003
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:23,239
way it is but I'm not sure about<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

1004
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:26,170
and immediate feedback so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1005
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:29,740
that thing about symbols and kind of

1006
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:31,450
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and many people feel like</font>

1007
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that what they're doing actually matters</font>

1008
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:37,660
and making a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem serious and</font>

1009
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,630
likely and so severe and that they are

1010
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,580
susceptible to it I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

1011
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:46,120
important thing is that strong fear has

1012
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:48,640
to be backed up and strong advocacy so

1013
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,130
minus of course in terms of response

1014
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,230
efficacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our solutions will actually</font>

1015
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,680
make a difference and also personal

1016
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,390
inadequacy so you actually can do it and

1017
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,529
you're you are knowledgeable enough you

1018
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,759
do have we're going to give you this

1019
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,680
training and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make you</font>

1020
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,440

1021

you that poverty of map and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1022
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,650
canvas that level format and finally

1023
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:14,859
assess and evaluate so getting feedback

1024
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and especially if you are using fear as</font>

1025
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:20,350
a kind of a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change behavior you</font>

can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not evaluated because</font>

1027
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,650
you don't know if all you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is</font>

1028
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:29,170
getting people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bury their head in the</font>

1039
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,660
that is awesome

1040
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually another question so as a</font>

1041
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:12,690
suspension with a bowl certain skills

1042
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:17,039
for assessing risk in a physical sense

1043
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:20,740
so we won't take risks in gathering food

1044
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,220
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> either wear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my dial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> break a leg or</font>

1045
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that when it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1046
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:29,288
technology we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do and</font>

1047
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:35,769
assessing the risk so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1048
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:37,980
the dichotomy of the user under

1049
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:40,299
estimating the risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as the</font>

1050
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:45,730
information security professional and

1051
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:48,549
overestimate movies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay question and so</font>

1052
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,960
I think it's one thing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1053
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:51,400
communicating the risk and I think that

1054
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we kind of do that quite well</font>

1055
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,539
and I think you're right we need to make

1056
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:01,808
sure we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't overestimate eggs as soon</font>

1057
00:45:55,539 --> 00:46:03,010
as we own recipe but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so it's</font>

1058
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,940
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1059
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,380
of efficacy so it's not just

1060
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,450
communicating the race place what you

1061
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,980
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and I think my pipe game</font>

1062
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,019
quite good at communicating the wrist

1063
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,549
and but we're not telling people enough

1064
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,109
about what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do and how they can</font>

1065
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I'm kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of why they should</font>

1066
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:21,130
do it so I sort of think it's it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1067
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,470
have to be done hunting around and but i

1068
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:27,400
also think we forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is quite</font>

1069
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:28,839
a new industry really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the internet</font>

1070
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,819
haven't been around for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that long</font>

1071
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:32,920
and people are still learning and it's

1072
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:35,440
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really fast so it's quite</font>

1073
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,680
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of balance that pace and</font>

1074
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,269
with any sort of and deep change and

1075
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,879
changing kind of cultural behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1076
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carell but</font>

1077
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:16,200
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good question and it's</font>

1078
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,990
something that again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1079
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,439
try and do with organizations so kind of

1080
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:24,419
doing stuff why when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in training</font>

1081
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,230
and do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like quizzes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and pop</font>

1082
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,120
quizzes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask a lot of questions and</font>

1083
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:32,130
like throw out sweets and so and that's

1084
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,950
dangerous because I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit a</font>

1085
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:39,260
woman smack bang in the middle of her

1086
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:39,259
head the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chocolate eclair only dreaming</font>

1087
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:48,510
so what was it was deep that's meant to

1088
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:50,940
be inherit but but so kind of little

1089
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:52,860
rewards in terms of that so that that

1090
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,500
has two events so one thing when you're

1091
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,450
delivering training and/or and when

1092
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,910
you're trying to deliver any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1093
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,620
knowledge you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it because if</font>

1094
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:04,020
you don't test it then people don't take

1095
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:06,480
it in as much and so a that's testing it

1096
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,430
but then be that sort of rewarding and i

1097
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,720
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also came out like sweets for</font>

1098
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:12,029
anybody and asks a question about

1099
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:15,240
anything and just to get people to kind

1100
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:18,099
of engage and and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to a wider</font>

1101
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,488
scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will put in place things</font>

1102
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:24,039
like and they will have a like a monthly

1103
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:27,160
thing where somebody goes away and

1104
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:31,779
either prepares like a little one page

1105
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,819
article on a certain topic and and then

1106
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:37,210
they do that and they get rewarded for

1107
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:38,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that or brief things you know it to you</font>

1108
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,499
meetings again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll click there with</font>

1109
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:45,460
materials so they can do quizzes and get

1110
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">into girls for that and get rewards for</font>

1111
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,539
that and then also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work with</font>

1112
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,569
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that give out certificates</font>

1113
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:54,359
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and engaging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1114
00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:56,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">behaviors like when they stopped someone</font>

1115
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:58,328
tailgating or when they do whatever like

1116
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:02,170
that and they'll be kind of pointed out

1117
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:06,039
as a as a change agent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the</font>

1118
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">curve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get acknowledged but also in</font>

1119
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,900
terms of the stick and psychology says

1120
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,578
quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff about that about</font>

1121
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,349
how to kind of punish people effectively

1122
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:18,869
and if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to punish people</font>

1123
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:20,619
effectively you have to and make them

1124
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:23,140
understand why they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being punished</font>

1125
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,839
and have respect when he's punishing

1126
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,368
them so if they don't think that the

1127
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,170
pace or punishing them is really a

1128
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:31,059
respect and if they don't think what

1129
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:34,779
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being punished or is something</font>

1130
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:36,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is actually a bad thing and then it</font>

1131
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:37,779
will not change<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> behaviour at all and</font>

1132
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:40,820
you can actually have the opposite

1133
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">effect and make them engage in</font>

1134
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:46,590
so it kind of goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this thing of</font>

1135
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,980
like a zebra<font color="#CCCCCC"> haverhill response and</font>

1136
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:51,240
activism in that if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1137
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,220
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something</font>

1138
00:49:51,240 --> 00:50:08,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if they don't think that it actually</font>

1139
00:49:53,220 --> 00:50:10,439
is worthy of doing yes the chocolate

1140
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,410
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely works and I got a kind</font>

1141
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow on which is sometimes we're in</font>

1142
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,879
situations where always want to

1143
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,710
apologize people were training because

1144
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,990
the solution with current imposing is

1145
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:24,840
really a band-aid because the saying

1146
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,490
don't click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on things were kind of sorry</font>

1147
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,260
that the Israeli<font color="#CCCCCC"> base allows you to</font>

1148
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,120
click on things in this situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1149
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,170
really shouldn't be in a situation where

1150
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've actually prevented this</font>

1151
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:35,160
information but we're not smart enough

1152
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the problem how do we kind of</font>

1153
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,299
get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> over that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky one</font>

1154
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,860
because what you're saying if you're

1155
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,900
apologizing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

1156
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,820
saying the solution doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1157
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,560
then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not engage with the</font>

1158
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:50,820
solution and that's kind of a theme

1159
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:56,910
again and legacy and so we need a

1160
00:50:50,820 --> 00:51:00,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and but also we have</font>

1161
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:04,609
to stop apologizing and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

1162
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:08,010
not our fault the solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

1163
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:10,799
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think as long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're apportion</font>

1164
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:12,210
it in sort of educating with those

1165
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,069
solutions as long as we don't expect

1166
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:15,720
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be ridiculous and to have</font>

1167
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:16,920
ridiculous levels of security then I

1168
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,098
don't think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should apologize for it</font>

1169
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,839
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more positive</font>

1170
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,089
in general I'm trying to be really

1171
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,009
positive when I'm delivering training

1172
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:30,720
and awareness-raising because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1173
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:33,569
can be a big negative and we can be a

1174
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,868
male apologetic and we can kind of feel

1175
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:38,550
a little bit fat and then that's no good

1176
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:48,150
for us and it's no mood for a profession

1177
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:56,970
but it's even worse very users<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to</font>

1178
00:51:48,150 --> 00:52:05,730
try in reality like what does affect us

1179
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:10,339
cost some people I know you've got stuff

1180
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:13,829
for like some people after<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving</font>

1181
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:16,109
really like in general at what cost yeah

1182
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:19,680
I thing cost is a huge problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

1183
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:22,020
know when I work organizations and did

1184
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,348
it bring any in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hangman and change in</font>

1185
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:27,180
this space if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not well resourced</font>

1186
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:29,460
and if it's not supported at the highest

1187
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">legoland</font>

1188
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bourne level</font>

1189
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">engaged and you have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font>

1190
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,630
holding the strings with the money and

1191
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,430
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pushing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because if</font>

1192
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:41,200
they're not then people don't have that

1193
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,879
trusting authority that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font>

1194
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">about earlier that they use actually</font>

1195
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,630
change and their behaviors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if they</font>

1196
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,640
don't sleep they don't think the big man

1197
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,740
or woman at the top actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has about</font>

1198
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight to throw some money at it and</font>

1199
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,189
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to change their</font>

1200
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">behaviors so yeah thing cost is a huge</font>

1201
00:52:54,190 --> 00:53:00,820
problem and but also when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1202
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,590
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell it and you have to</font>

1203
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,650
convince the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person you're selling to</font>

1204
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:07,060
about response and efficacy so you have

1205
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:12,580
to convince them to what you're selling

1206
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:14,500
is actually gonna work and so again that

1207
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,690
ties into not being apologetic and

1208
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,280
having some confidence but what you're

1209
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,170
selling is at least kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of better than</font>

1210
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing I'm not exactly like selling</font>

1211
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,550
oil but if you're if you believe in what

1212
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,360
you're selling and you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

1213
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for that organization</font>

1214
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">which you should do it for selling it</font>

1215
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:32,200
and then you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be apologetic you</font>

1216
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:35,290
have to convince the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers when you're</font>

1217
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">selling to that it is a something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1218
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:40,270
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that that</font>

1219
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:42,310
organization can take on board and then

1220
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:44,940
you get their engagement and having them

1221
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:46,840
engaged does I've seen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1222
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,730
organizations that have those engaged in

1223
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:51,690
that don't have the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the top</font>

1224
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,690
engaging to have a huge

1225
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:29,828
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're absolutely right and</font>

1226
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:34,819
it's anyone waterways I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1227
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:37,339
and so it's easy to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fear and</font>

1228
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:39,829
it is harder and and that the threat and

1229
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:41,690
it's easy scare people and it's harder

1230
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:43,339
much harder to get them engaged with

1231
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,609
what they can do and feeling like they

1232
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:48,680
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make a difference and and I</font>

1233
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's kind of a it's a</font>

1234
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:54,200
multi-faceted solution to a

1235
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,290
multi-faceted problem but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1236
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,060
I think you sort of have to start off

1237
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,740
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> outdoor talk about that the</font>

1238
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,710
governor's so you have to give people

1239
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">roles make them feel empowered and then</font>

1240
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,609
give them that kind of cognitive map of

1241
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:11,210
all the things they can do not overwhelm

1242
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:12,890
them but i found when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the fear</font>

1243
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,680
and you have to back<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up immediately</font>

1244
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:18,200
with the solutions and we making people

1245
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,450
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they can do then i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

1246
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,828
find that people really taking on water

1247
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,450
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of really run with it</font>

1248
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:25,579
especially if they've got wrong they

1249
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,529
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and and if it's</font>

1250
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:28,550
supported at the top so it kind of all

1251
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:32,270
these different things have to come

1252
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:33,110
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it is as you say I</font>

1253
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's building</font>

1254
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,560
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect them to change their</font>

1255
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,819
cultural their<font color="#E5E5E5"> behaviors overnight but</font>

1256
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,320
you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to change one or two and</font>

1257
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,750
then you build it up and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and</font>

1258
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,460
if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have people in the</font>

1259
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:45,440
organization with the roles doing that

1260
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,420
then as I've got ideas and rubbish

1261
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,440
phrase but they become like the change

1262
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:53,180
agents and they become the ones where

1263
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">behaviors kind of lead out from another</font>

1264
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:58,430

very resistant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fear they don't</font>

00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:16,490
you've sort of turned them around give

1273

them a role and they will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones</font>

1311
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:33,600
would be never inarius a nightmare and

1312
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:37,350
when an ebay have a problem while ago a

1313
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,930
month or whenever it was I went on a few

1314
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:41,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">news programs and aunt of our air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1315
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,220
wrote an article for Sunday Times about

1316
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:46,259
passwords and it's a nightmare because

1317
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:49,910
he put it's a really difficult problem

1318
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,910
because how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people supposed to</font>

1319
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,650
and they as opposed to have incredibly

1320
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:57,920
complicated passwords for each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1321
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:59,120
you're not persuaded down and so you're

1322
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking people to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1323
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,870
really difficult there is no better

1324
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,550
solution will get said like over 10

1325
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,259
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the password will soon be dead</font>

1326
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:08,180
and it still isn't because there's no

1327
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,580
about a solution and as we've talked

1328
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,680
about in a couple talks today and so

1329
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,690
it's a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem it's not easy to fix</font>

1330
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,100
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think why trying to do</font>

1331
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly with the article was</font>

1332
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:22,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">explained why so going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1333
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:24,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Leventhal thing and tetanus and so it's</font>

1334
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,360
about not just kind of sorrowful the

1335
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:28,129
woman depends it so getting people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1336
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,080
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we often don't join up the dots in</font>

1337
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,520
this so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> love you don't get people to</font>

1338
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,529
really understand what the problem is

1339
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,880
and all they hear is you should do this

1340
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,680
thing that's really hard and really

1341
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,330
complicated and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take time</font>

1342
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,060
and mental effort and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really busy</font>

1343
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:44,299
and stress about other stuff so we're

1344
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:46,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking a logging and so kind of</font>

1345
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:49,910
explaining the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell and the wine and</font>

1346
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:52,160
also giving them a simple advice and

1347
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:55,240
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they need to do and so</font>

1348
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">really laying it out for them and but</font>

1349
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,439
passwords are actually doing because it

1350
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:02,900
is just a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a nightmare and the</font>

1351
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,370
interviews I gave in particular around

1352
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you laying around they all wanted to</font>

1353
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:09,319
know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> hazards and so I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

1354
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,549
radio for talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and I was</font>

1355
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,810
going to be

1356
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:15,280
passwords and both of them ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1357
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:20,350
saying like roll by it's a nightmare

1358
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:23,620
isn't it what we want me to say solution

1359
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:26,620
and but I think the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1360
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,210
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there are</font>

1361
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,339
serious effects<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there that they do</font>

1362
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:32,200
apply to them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

1363
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">get hacked and why they shouldn't why</font>

1364
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:37,210
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want people accessing all of</font>

1365
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,310
their accounts and what I having the

1366
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:41,680
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubbage pass me that every count is</font>

1367
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,390
a bad idea if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people I</font>

1368
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,009
think we often take the ground to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1369
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,960
level of knowledge and waking people

1370
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,250
will just automatically get that having

1371
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,360
the same rubbish password for every

1372
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:52,390
accountants that as soon as that

1373
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:54,400
password to access and lost all your

1374
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,140
accounts but if nobody's actually

1375
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,520
explain to someone they'd ever sit and

1376
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,520
think it through they don't care about

1377
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,590
this stuff as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much as we do and so kind</font>

1378
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of making sure you actually explained it</font>

1379
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:08,950
and then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help people come up</font>

1380
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a system or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having better</font>

1381
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:28,589
passwords why did you like destroying

1382
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:31,090
police were using really yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again</font>

1383
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifics on loans things so people that</font>

1384
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:37,480
have respect for him or and people who

1385
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,860
think that he you know so kind of

1386
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,190
choosing people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can relate</font>

1387
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to so that will impact on so I think</font>

1388
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:47,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is cool and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I as I to be like</font>

1389
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:51,040
him then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am more likely to engage with</font>

1390
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:53,250
that morning so we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brittany</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1391
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,250
can't

1392
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:59,839
but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them got hacked and so she is</font>

1393
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,800
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about it because she</font>

1394
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:06,920
knows that saving demographic she knows

1395
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:10,040
it sucks she also knows it demographic

1396
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:12,290
and we'll listen to it was they respect

1397
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,300
her and she's an influential figure to

1398
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:17,630
them so the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get different</font>

1399
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:21,320
people to engage this subject and spread

1400
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:24,080
the message about it the better and

1401
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:27,710
that's why someone who was in RSA

1402
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:30,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Conference and Miss Teen USA went she</font>

01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:32,030
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> her webcam hacked and I was really</font>

1404
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:34,730
disappointed sings as it's like when the

1405
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:36,740
security issues are but on Twitter

1406
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:40,600
people were going like crazy sort of

1407
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:40,600
snogging they're all going and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1408
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:47,029
imagining the security conference and I

1409
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,740
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really negative thing</font>

1410
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:51,050
like we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be encouraging more</font>

1411
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,729
married<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to engage with eggs and</font>

1412
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,710
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have relevant experience</font>

1413
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:57,130
because a bunch of teenage girls in

1414
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:59,600
America like suddenly me hiding their

1415
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:02,330
webcam because they have seen someone

1416
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,750
that they aspire to be like Facebook

1417
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,750
danger

1418
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:17,420
we've got one<font color="#E5E5E5"> email one block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> resting</font>

1419
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the far corner of them both have two and</font>

1420
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,640

1421
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,850
that's a really great point and then you

1422
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,170
articulated something that I was sort

1423
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,670
trying to save for when you want to play

1424
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:15,380
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better than me which was kind</font>

1425
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:17,180
of starting off with just changing some

1426
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:20,420
behaviors or just getting people from

1427
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:22,160
nothing to a bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's much more</font>

1428
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,630

1432
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:31,820
that's a really good point I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1433
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,340
get something is better than nothing ask

1434
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:36,140
me often we judge us by our standards

1435
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,870
and monies and help

1436
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:40,790

1439
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,580
same way that a professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> does and so</font>

1440
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,840
