us get in here for everybody

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,360
uh besides augusta uh here's what i knew

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,120
about it they said hey sir will you

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
speak at b-sides absolutely i'm in

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,760
with not a lot of knowledge of what that

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,199
meant

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,480
uh but

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,320
i was eager based on who asked me in the

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
fact that it came from the team here at

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
b-sides

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
then they came back and said yeah it's

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
the keynote it's about an hour long

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
well you talking to me

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,600
who talks for an hour

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,479
uh

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
maybe i will today maybe i won't we'll

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,320
see how this goes but

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
uh my memory of uh b-sides right the

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,360
term for me means perhaps something

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,759
different i look around i'm i'm of the

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,000
older crowd in the room right who has

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
45s at home

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
albums of vinyl right okay so you had

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,320
the little adapter we know what b-sides

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
are that's not what we're talking about

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,280
here

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
what happened in vegas didn't stay in

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
vegas

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
augusta is now

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
the third i understand large

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
organization

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
gathering and i think that speaks

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,000
volumes not only about you who you are

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
your innovative spirit but it speaks a

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
little bit about the magnetism of

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
augusta

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
there are some good things going on in

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,159
augusta georgia some great things

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,000
happening up on fort gordon some great

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
things happening in the community it

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
crosses the river

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,079
uh so that is why

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,439
i'm excited uh and uh there are some

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,920
things that uh that i've learned in the

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
couple years i've been up at fort gordon

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
i'll tell you this i've learned more in

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
the last

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
two years of being here than i did in

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
the first three i was here in 1994 to

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,920
97.

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
i didn't leave here in 97 thinking i

66
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,599
would be back

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,200
and i certainly didn't

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
believe i'd be back to witness the

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
growth and explosion of what's happening

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
in augusta georgia

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,800
in the cyber community and in the work

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,640
that we all do together both

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
privately academia

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
and in industry as well

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,720
as the government

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,840
so

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
today i have a few goals

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
if if i can help

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
open up a day of

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,360
uh

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,519
technology innovation discussion you

82
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,280
could feel it in the room outside if i

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
can help open that up i'm all for it

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
uh i'll try to do three things well i'll

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
talk a little bit about what i've seen

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
in terms of the growth of what's going

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,080
on in cyber general fogerty is my

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
current boss lieutenant general fogarty

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
he was here six years ago as major

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
general fogerty standing up here as a

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,879
speaker and at that time the cyber

92
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,840
branch in the army was

93
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,400
one uh one year old

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
by way of example yesterday the army

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
cyber

96
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
organization celebrated its 11th

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
anniversary so i want to talk a little

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,799
bit about the change because i think

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
it's important

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
i i want to highlight

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,319
a little bit of what i've learned

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
leading a technical organization so i'm

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
going to spend a little part in the

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
middle of this discussion today

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
hopefully the meat of the discussion

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
providing you my reflections on what

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
i've learned about leading a technical

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
organization i grew up as an

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,319
intelligence officer i'm not suggesting

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
that that is not technical or there

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,640
weren't hard problems to solve in the

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,120
intelligence field but i've had to

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
challenge some of my preconceived

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,680
notions and assumptions about the force

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
that i'm honored to be a part of and

116
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,080
lead and i think and i hope

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,840
that some of those observations have

118
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,519
parallels in your world

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,639
and

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
will hopefully be helpful whether you

121
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,199
are new to that organization are charged

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,040
with leading it have been around it or

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
are new to it and coming from the

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,759
outside of it

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
and then finally a little bit of a

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
reflection about what's going on in

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
the world if you will the world that we

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,400
work in

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
in cyber

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
the threat actors that are our

131
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
adversaries working against us how they

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
might be doing that and close with some

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
challenges where i think we could use

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,639
your help in the future

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,560
closing with those challenges in order

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
to uh suggest that

137
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
as you go out today

138
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
and talk deeper

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
more deeply about

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
the technology behind some of that the

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,440
innovative spirit what hackers are into

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
what what problems are the most vexing

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,199
that you're going to center around and

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,320
solve

145
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
uh maybe some of those things are things

146
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
we

147
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
uh the army army cyber could work with

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
you on in the future

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,880
because i think it's clear to all of us

150
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
in the room that uh things that are

151
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,639
happening against us

152
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
are not uh solely isolated against the

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,400
government

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
are not solely isolated against the

155
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
private sector and there is certainly

156
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
bleed over and national security risk

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
associated with all of that so those are

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,800
my goals

159
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
i hope to do it in a way that keeps

160
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
people excited i know some people in the

161
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
room

162
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
if one of them falls asleep i won't be

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
surprised it happens to me

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
uh every day of the week with a few of

165
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
these characters uh that are here i do

166
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
recognize some other faces i'd be remiss

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,199
if i didn't suggest that i've also

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,000
been introduced to people already today

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
who are legends in your field

170
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,840
so i arrive very humbled uh to be in the

171
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,639
room

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,360
uh if i can help kick this thing off

173
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
i'll be very happy i had to take off

174
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
some of the bling i was starting to to

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
earn i brought some of my own however so

176
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
as we move forward here uh participation

177
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
could get you something in return it's

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
um

179
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
it's not a trick it's not a recruiting

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
tool there are no reenlistment forms in

181
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,919
my bag

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,840
although uh i do have some in my truck

183
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
so we could get a lot done if we had to

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,400
there

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
okay

186
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,319
i'm in charge of that

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,800
here we go

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
can anybody tell me and you can use

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
devices

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
can anybody tell me what any one of

191
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,440
those

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,919
numbers mean

193
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
relative to

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
the topic i'm speaking on

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,479
because i'm sure they could be applied

196
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
to anything

197
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
okay all you have to do at this point

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
now is raise your hand and guess

199
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
yes

200
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,520
okay which number are you choosing

201
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,800
okay

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,360
so um

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,599
let's see what i got

204
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,560
you can pick between medium and large

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
uh

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
what's that

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,599
well you can give it away

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,560
it says r cyber

209
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,039
here you go

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
okay

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560

thank you sir i appreciate you having

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
the courage to raise your hand uh i

if that's true

218
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
we got a bigger problem than i thought

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
uh

220
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,319

and it says at the bottom this is an

223
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
antique it says attack defend exploit

224
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
army cyber we've changed that a little

225
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,800
bit but who doesn't like to exploit um

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
thank you sir how about one more

227
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,159
yes oh do you work in said headquarters

228
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,679
okay uh meet me halfway you're gonna get

229
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
uh the remaining t-shirt

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,120
and two monster drinks

231
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
um the beverage of choice in the

232
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
building that you rightfully identified

233
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
yeah well now you can share with a

234
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,640
friend

235
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,519
um

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
so

237
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
and i do have locks i brought i'm not

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
sure what that's all about but i have a

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
couple now i know uh we'll pick some

240
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
locks later

241
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
uh

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
these numbers speak to me

243
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
where the where the military where the

244
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
army where the department of va

245
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,399
defense invests its money

246
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,240
and builds infrastructure you can see

247
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
its priorities

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
and in this case what we're talking

249
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
about 1.6 billion dollars is the

250
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
investment in the new cyber campus

251
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
portrayed in those renderings

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
that is being built on fort gordon

253
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,920
georgia now

254
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
if if you're been up there there's a big

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
crane sitting next to signal tower

256
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
signal towers was there when i moved on

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
on 1994.

258
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
i never uh imagined we tried to put a

259
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
you know military intelligence banner

260
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
over it and play pranks on it and we

261
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
wanted to paint the water tower or get

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,480
rid of the semaphore flags well all

263
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
that's kind of happening and it's

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
happening because of a significant

265
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
investment in the cyber center of

266
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
excellence being at fort gordon georgia

267
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
when general fogerty spoke here six

268
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
years ago that vision was coming to life

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
this building

270
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
that he

271
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,959
has recently occupied i'll show you in

272
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
the next picture right that is

273
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
coming to life the cyber center of

274
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
excellence coming to life signal towers

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,760
regrettably but necessarily will come

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,800
down and new will erupt and so there's a

277
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,320
lot going on 3 36 we'll talk about 16

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
000 a year is the number of students

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that pass through the gates of fort

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
gordon to get trained in cyber and

281
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,920
signal

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
that's that's significant throughput

283
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
so there's a paul kraft running the

284
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,519
cyber school as an example teaching the

285
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
newest formations creating new

286
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,079
formations and putting them down at the

287
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,640
lowest echelons of our army in addition

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
to those that come fight with us inside

289
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
of army cyber

290
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
10 500 the size of the

291
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,519
army cyber

292
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
organization that's military and

293
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
civilian about half military half

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
civilian and that's in the military

295
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
that's across

296
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
all three what we call compos that's

297
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,519
active duty force national guard and

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,160
reserve so we're the newest branch in

299
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
our army but we're growing significantly

300
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
and then 1.4 million anyone want that

301
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,680
one

302
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
yeah

303
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,959
no well

304
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
no um

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
uh what can i give away

306
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
i can give you my locks um i owe you

307
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
something i'll i'll take care of that

308
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
that is um

309
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
that's the size of the network

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,640
we in the army are charged to defend

311
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,640
1.4 million endpoints without mobile

312
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
devices

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
across five continents

314
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
significant work

315
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
and so when i talk about being world

316
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
class it's not just about buildings

317
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,519
there's another building

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,200
okay and it is

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
premier and it is beautiful which we

320
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,399
should expect at 336 million dollars

321
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,519
but it is

322
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
and it's well equipped as it should be

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
to put in the army's cyber force

324
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
but it's it's a lot more than that

325
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,160
while it is a world-class facility

326
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,680
what's in it is world-class talent that

327
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,079
we're growing training recruiting

328
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,160
sustaining retaining right and that's

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,639
not easy i think all of us would agree

330
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,920
in whatever part of the field you're

331
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
working in

332
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
that's not necessarily an easy thing the

333
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,920
talent

334
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,560
competition is significant how do you

335
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
attract it well the last word there my

336
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
argument would be what we have that is

337
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,200
powerful

338
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,600
is our mission whether it's the size and

339
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
scope of what we do as evidenced by the

340
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
1.4 million endpoints

341
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,839
whether it's the

342
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,360
fact that was mentioned in the kind

343
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
introduction that

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,079
we can do some things that are otherwise

345
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,839
not

346
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,600
legal uh that

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
we are doing it in a spectrum

348
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
so

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
from

350
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
guys in coat closets

351
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
forward deployed in a very dusty area i

352
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,440
visited them about a month ago we have

353
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
an expeditionary cyber team

354
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
when we in the army say expeditionary

355
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,519
that means

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,560
spartan

357
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,040
you are not eating well well you're kind

358
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,880
of eating well depending on where you go

359
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
uh but you're living in plywood perhaps

360
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
you've definitely got a roommate uh you

361
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
all smell bad your days are long your

362
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,360
nights are longer you're away from your

363
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,320
family

364
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
we call that expeditionary

365
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
so an expeditionary cyber team forward

366
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
deployed not working in this beautiful

367
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,959
facility working in the storage closet

368
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,120
in a forward-deployed location with

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
other people's broken equipment and

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
their little rig

371
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
doing what we've asked them to do on

372
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
behalf of the commander on the ground

373
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
they are just as motivated as the men

374
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
and women who work in this building

375
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
because of the mission that we're asked

376
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
to do and i think that's a powerful

377
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,240
powerful thing uh i i can tell another

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,880
story about why i think that mission is

379
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
what makes these facilities worth the

380
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
investment

381
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
in a room with no windows you would

382
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
expect us to have rooms with no windows

383
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
right in a room with no windows during

384
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
an operation

385
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
lots of folks in there it smells like i

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,040
tell this story often it smells like

387
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
monster

388
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
uh it smells like body odor it smells

389
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
like energy i mean it there's a lot

390
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,360
going on in here we are crushing uh on a

391
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
a

392
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
live mission

393
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,720
and i hear somebody who is well regarded

394
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
in our force well regarded in the field

395
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,880
he is a uh what we would at the time

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
call a junior leader a company great

397
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
leader

398
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
but he's been around

399
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,199
uh

400
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
both privately and within the army uh in

401
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,880
his work and i hear him utter the words

402
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
this is the best day of my army career

403
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,160
and at the time i didn't know how

404
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
powerful it was

405
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
and here's what i now know it was the

406
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,760
best day in his army career because we

407
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,240
were asked to do something

408
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
to take an action

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,399
that was going to have a significant

410
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
effect

411
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
and it was otherwise not going to happen

412
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,880
unless we had organized the right talent

413
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,279
in the right facility and given them the

414
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,720
right mission

415
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
and said we need you to do this

416
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,680
solve this problem and have an effect

417
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,199
so to me

418
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,959
we're very proud of what's happening up

419
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,959
at fort gordon there's a lot happening

420
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,399
up there

421
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,160
when you think of the army cyber

422
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,360
formation there are folks in the room

423
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
raise your hands

424
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,320
come on

425
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,000
okay i'm not doing that to isolate you i

426
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
want to do it because we're we are

427
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,480
in this conversation and we have talent

428
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,399
we want more talent but if you want to

429
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,320
further understand how you can connect

430
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
to it i have some ambassadors in the

431
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
room they're here on their own accord um

432
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
but i think it would be great uh to

433
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,000
further explore what that looks like in

434
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,199
practice

435
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
any questions on uh the numbers thank

436
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
you for participating in the survey

437
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,639
uh that's what's going on uh in these

438
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,759
buildings

439
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,440
now

440
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,519
general paul stanton is running the

441
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,279
cyber center of excellence he's doing a

442
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,839
lot of great work with innovative things

443
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,759
general paul kraft is running the cyber

444
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
school we are expanding how we're

445
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,199
attracting talent we have industry

446
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,880
partnerships we'll talk a little bit

447
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,040
more about what that looks like uh in

448
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
the middle part of the discussion we are

449
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
doing direct commissioning now we're

450
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
taking folks right out of

451
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
uh the the private sector and saying

452
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
world direct commission you as an

453
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,639
officer of cyber

454
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,959
we have uh civilian

455
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
uh summer internships that lead to

456
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
uh further work in the government

457
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,240
service so we're trying to expand and

458
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
and grow the branch in a meaningful way

459
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,959
we're creating more structure and by

460
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,880
that that's that's saying we're creating

461
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
more cyber at echelon so that

462
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,839
at the

463
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,480
expeditionary level you all know that

464
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,319
means you're carrying everything on your

465
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,839
back

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,720
at the expeditionary level to the 336

467
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
million dollar building level we are

468
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,359
going to have cyber expertise it will

469
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,799
take a while to grow but that is

470
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
underway so there's a lot happening

471
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,599
within the force a lot has happened

472
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,400
since we last spoke to this group

473
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,240
six years ago

474
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,559
okay

475
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
star wars reference um

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,120
it's a thing right uh i took off

477
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
some other references i was given a

478
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,039
light to wear and

479
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,559
it's by somebody i know and i really

480
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,600
wasn't sure what i was wearing um

481
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,799
so

482
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,320
second part of the conversation five

483
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,400
lessons okay

484
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
those are uh duffel bags

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
duffel bags uh

486
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
stacked at the national training center

487
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
which is a

488
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
very desolate nasty part of the

489
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,840
california desert

490
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,640
that

491
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,919
i had in 2009

492
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
2010 training a unit to take them to

493
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
afghanistan

494
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
for combat operations

495
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
i took this picture

496
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
and this picture says a lot of things to

497
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,559
me often but but what i often

498
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,720
think about when i look at it

499
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
are the people that i was charged with

500
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
leading and honored to be a part of

501
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
their team well one of the lessons that

502
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
i've learned now and i use this to help

503
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,440
reflect on it as i discuss it with you

504
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,600
today i knew everybody

505
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,919
in that unit i should i knew their job i

506
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,039
had done most of their jobs or

507
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
could represent them based on my own

508
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
experience

509
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
i knew everything in that bag

510
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
each bag because we told them what goes

511
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
in it

512
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
so

513
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
i i was asked to train this unit lead

514
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,559
them into combat i had to train

515
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,640
12 people

516
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
to do one job

517
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
usually you know there's a formation and

518
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
there's a there's a a team a squad and

519
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
you're training them to do a task and

520
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,120
it's it's very

521
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
uh well documented

522
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,320
well my lesson in cyber is that

523
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,919
that is not true

524
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,640
cyber is many things

525
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
it could be what we call the work rule

526
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
the task that we give you whether you're

527
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
an uh an online operator a hacker

528
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
whether you are a coder a developer

529
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
whether you're a defender it could be

530
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,679
the organization that you're assigned to

531
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
whether you're offense defense

532
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
development uh could be doctrine right

533
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,440
we're

534
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
but but that

535
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,080
that's kind of what you get from us

536
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,840
on our table of organization right our

537
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,799
mtos and it could be what you get uh in

538
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
position descriptions or or hiring

539
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
actions right here's what we want you to

540
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,159
do and it defines it i i think the power

541
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,080
is really though and what the passion of

542
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
the people happens to be

543
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
i am into coding i am into hacking i am

544
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,520
into

545
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
network engineering

546
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
knowing what the passion of the

547
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
organization is

548
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,960
is really powerful it could come down to

549
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,400
languages i'm a i'm a r i'm a python guy

550
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
i'm uh or down to devices right i'm uh

551
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
uh

552
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
what do i do i'm unix i'm windows right

553
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,159
all that's gonna get talked about across

554
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
the thing so my epiphany was

555
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,240
the the organization in cyber

556
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,799
is going to deliver you some things but

557
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
it's not going to deliver you everything

558
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,640
so

559
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
so what do you do about that well what i

560
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,120
think you do is you take inventory right

561
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
you you start to identify what what do i

562
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,799
have

563
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,480
and and

564
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
for me

565
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
i had to display something called that

566
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
my term

567
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
confident vulnerability i did not grow

568
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
up as a computer science major i didn't

569
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,360
grow up

570
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,400
in the world

571
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,080
confident vulnerability how to ask

572
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,679
questions and listen in a way that

573
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,360
allows you to sense what's going on in

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,880
that organization

575
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
because i would then argue that the next

576
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,559
lesson is

577
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,120
hard problems and we like to think in

578
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,919
cyber we only solve hard problems

579
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,480
require you to rewrite that org chart

580
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
right the hierarchy is not going to be

581
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,799
important to solving hard problems

582
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,400
but yet

583
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
i would offer

584
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,559
cyber is not filled with the most

585
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,360
extroverted crowd

586
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,120
right so

587
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
it's not naturally going to resolve

588
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
itself into people coming across

589
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,919
boundaries of the organization or out of

590
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,520
you know rooms with no windows into

591
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,120
further rooms with no windows or out of

592
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
collaborative spaces and you know it's

593
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,679
it's more in our world we i told you we

594
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,960
outfitted the building beautifully

595
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
everyone has monitors and we can all get

596
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,280
on skype chat we can do it's more than

597
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
open bay space and monitors and and and

598
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,440
being able to do uh you know skype chat

599
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,360
with your your friends

600
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,559
co-workers

601
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,840
um

602
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
it it's about how do you identify that

603
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
you have these differences what did you

604
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
do about the inventory you took and then

605
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,039
crushing them together

606
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,240
because

607
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,720
problem solving people you know pick the

608
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,880
lock differently to use the b-sides

609
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
reference right like they're they're

610
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,799
you've got to bring different mindsets

611
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,880
together to solve problems so this was

612
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
my early this is my doodling i'm a

613
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
doodler i apologize for it often uh

614
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
there's some people in the room that

615
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,039
hate it uh

616
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,600
max as you saw he he works with me and

617
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
he hates it

618
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,720
this was my early doodle this was early

619
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
on in my time as part of the the our

620
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
cyber team what am i doing to make sure

621
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,919
i'm drawing these folks together because

622
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,600
we have hard problems and i can't look

623
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
at it one way it can't be

624
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,679
all the defenders in one room talking

625
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,200
about a defensive problem that'll get

626
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,360
you nowhere it can't be the developers

627
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
in a vacuum just developing stuff

628
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,400
because they want to

629
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,679
which they will naturally do right

630
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,520
if you give them some time and some

631
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
money they'll they'll

632
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
write code to solve problems that might

633
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
be interesting but not important right

634
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,000
it's great energy but how do you focus

635
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
that on that hard problem and then how

636
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
do you tune most importantly and i'll

637
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
admit we are not here yet we we have not

638
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
arrived at the nirvana of once you

639
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
identify the skills and attributes of

640
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,919
each of these people what what makes

641
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
these types of folks tick what makes a

642
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,880
you know a sigan or someone who grew up

643
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,840
in the nsa enterprise right doing cigant

644
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
work well there's a mindset that comes

645
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,360
with that what they're analytical in a

646
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
certain way they they like hard problems

647
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
but they look at them differently

648
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
developers hackers defenders right

649
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,240
there's this group of things how do you

650
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
recruit that talent what are the skills

651
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,960
and attributes

652
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,279
that i'm looking for well how do you

653
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,120
then tune what you're doing in

654
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,039
recruitment to get that that's a hard

655
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
challenge and i think that challenge is

656
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,679
not unique

657
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,440
to the government

658
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,480
how how does any organization recruit

659
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,880
identify get the right thing within it

660
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
so that the inventory becomes

661
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
more wholesome and more rewarding about

662
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,360
the type of

663
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,279
diversity of thought diversity of

664
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,039
background

665
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,320
frankly diversity of experience

666
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,039
in one room

667
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,120
and i think

668
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,279
i don't know hard problem if you're not

669
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,400
doing a hard problem then you're

670
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,919
probably not

671
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,840
earning your pay right like

672
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
um there are enough hard problems to

673
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
solve that easy one should be someone

674
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
else's work my joke would be that's for

675
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,679
the navy

676
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,960
but um

677
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
i understand some of you might be

678
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,880
associated with the navy

679
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
that's your own fault

680
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,400
okay

681
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,120
so uh obviously a picture i did not take

682
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
myself

683
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
my technique am i driving you crazy sir

684
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,919
by moving

685
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,600
okay uh

686
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
my technique uh has been long to use

687
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
pictures i took myself because i know

688
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,799
what they represent and i don't run

689
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,400
afoul of

690
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,039
infringement uh but does anyone and i

691
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,799
don't have a prize for you but i'll come

692
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,559
up with one anyone know where this

693
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,279
location is

694
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,159
scarif who said that

695
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,760
oh nice good work okay i owe you

696
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,840
something too

697
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,159
um uh yes it's scarif

698
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,480
so what did what did we do

699
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
what did i learn about

700
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,640
taking that doodle and saying i gotta

701
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
crush these people together i gotta find

702
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
a way to make the grassroots of this

703
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,799
organization

704
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
speak

705
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,360
to the entirety of the organization well

706
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,320
i was in a developer's room with a bunch

707
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,240
of here's what when i say developers

708
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,159
these are the the guys that we say hey

709
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,919
we need something built write a bunch of

710
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,600
code that's going to solve this problem

711
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
and we spend a lot of time putting them

712
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,120
together because the brain trust of a

713
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
group of developers we believe in the

714
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
power of this kind of bring them all

715
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
together and this this coalescence of

716
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
developers will help us solve problems

717
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
bigger and there is truth in all of that

718
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,559
but you know what else the minute you

719
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,320
close the door they might solve a

720
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,760
problem that again is only important to

721
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,559
them

722
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,400
we often would take visitors into the

723
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,760
development room and

724
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,400
showcase the talent and the brilliance

725
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,799
and the capability that we had

726
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,640
so i've been through there a lot with

727
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,159
visitors

728
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,159
i went one time on my own

729
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
and just said hey guys

730
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
i'm sorry i only come here when vips are

731
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,840
visiting i just came today to hang out

732
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,559
and learn and as i'm learning i went

733
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
around the room made everyone talk i'm

734
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,720
on you know say something sorry i don't

735
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,000

736
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,279
something no sir i'm not going to say

737
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,000
anything damn it say something um so

738
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
you shock him into it and a young guy

739
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
says i remember a time when we used to

740
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,760
talk to the teams and for us the teams

741
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,279
are where the magic happens right that's

742
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,960
where i told you the story of the guy

743
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,240
best day of my army career

744
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,080
and he didn't know it when he said it

745
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,679
but it was an epiphany for me wait a

746
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,960
minute we have an entire organization

747
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
that's charged with building solutions

748
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,919
that isn't talking

749
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,480
to the people that need them

750
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
he said we used to i remember a time and

751
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,399
he was only like 20 right i'm like you

752
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,480
remember a time um

753
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,559
i remember a time

754
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,520
but it it struck a chord with me

755
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,960
because i remembered a time when i was

756
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,919
20. uh

757
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,120
so we created an organization

758
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,039
absolute wrong term we created an idea

759
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
about i'm gonna

760
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
put three hours on the calendar once a

761
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,760
quarter and we're gonna bring together

762
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,840
these developers and we're gonna bring

763
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
together the teams

764
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,399
and

765
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,559
we'll put out a call for you know papers

766
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,360
and ideas and it's going to be

767
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,679
teams and developers talking i'll be

768
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,679
there you're not briefing me

769
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,679
i might not say anything

770
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,760
i do have a lot of questions but you're

771
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,520
just going to talk what are we all doing

772
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,880
why are we doing it how can we do it

773
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
better what's the future look like and

774
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,840
so true to form whenever you come up

775
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,679
with an idea

776
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,600
you know you've got a good idea an army

777
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,440
cyber if someone gives it a star wars

778
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,799
nickname

779
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
okay so we gave it a star wars nickname

780
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,240
i think

781
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,880
somewhat apropos uh if i've got scarif

782
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
right there were some bad things

783
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,279
happening on that island we'd like to

784
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,279
think we're doing good things over that

785
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,679
planet

786
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,000
but uh and it was also i think based on

787
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,440
a spelling mistake which i think is

788
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,120
common uh for how we name things in

789
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,080
cyber as well um but um

790
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,240
but there we are so we gave it a name

791
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
we've kind of tried to keep it weird

792
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
when we meet these things we're doing

793
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,760
them virtually

794
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
there's people dressed up like

795
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
characters and all that is really my way

796
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,200
of saying look this is not a boardroom

797
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,799
meeting this is not a powerpoint

798
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,360
briefing this is it's your event the

799
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
only reason i'm doing it is because i

800
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,919
have the ability to bring you together

801
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,240
and to and more importantly i have the

802
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,320
ability to listen

803
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,120
and elevate your good ideas into this

804
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,559
organization

805
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,399
and so for me

806
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
grassroots is where it's at in technical

807
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,559
organizations and and what and and

808
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,399
nothing in in your meeting structure

809
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
typically and this is probably true in

810
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
and out of government nothing in your

811
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
meeting structure is going to get after

812
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,360
this you've got to find a new way to get

813
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,080
after this and and there are cool ways

814
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
like make an open bar you know make you

815
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,279
know feed them well give them monster

816
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,360
i think all those things are true

817
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,200
but but is the leader of the

818
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
organization my epiphany am i doing my

819
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,600
job to make sure that i'm involved in

820
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
forcing this to happen because it

821
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,360
doesn't naturally happen

822
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,960
and and not forcing in a way of

823
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
authority

824
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
yep we wear uniforms to work it's mostly

825
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,159
because we don't want to make bad

826
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,039
choices in what we would otherwise wear

827
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
my son told me today when i left he goes

828
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,799
you're not cool i'm like okay thanks

829
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,000
um

830
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,399
so uh

831
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,480
you know but but am i doing my job are

832
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
we creating this i think it must be

833
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,399
cultivated that's my lesson

834
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,159
and i'm sticking to it and i would stick

835
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,200
to it outside of um

836
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
government as well a good friend of mine

837
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,399
uh his name is nate uh he ran end game

838
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
for a while he's still associated with

839
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,360
the company uh we talked about this

840
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
topic we talked about culture

841
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,760
uh and i said you know is this i've been

842
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,240
i've visited places where the appearance

843
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,080
of grassroots happens he goes no it's

844
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,679
not as easy you're

845
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,080
it's not isolated to the government and

846
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
he had come out of the marine corps so

847
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,039
he he had a definite point of comparison

848
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,240
so

849
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,200
my fourth lesson

850
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,760
i did not take this picture although uh

851
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
some in the room would accuse me of

852
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,039
being old enough for black and white

853
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,600
photography um

854
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,760
the reason i use this picture is because

855
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,000
of the camouflage net

856
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,360
and uh

857
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
years ago i read a book called

858
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,679
spit-shine syndrome chris

859
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,200
basford is a great

860
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,360
really he studies and is an expert in

861
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,600
clausewitz but he wrote a book about the

862
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,399
organizational irrationality of the

863
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,880
united states field army

864
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,559
there's a lot in there there's a lot of

865
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
irrational behavior in the army over

866
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,880
time he was focused in a certain period

867
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,080
of time but

868
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,880
a story that has always resonated with

869
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,399
me and i've never forgotten from this

870
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,880
book i can almost go to the page and say

871
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,399
you know you need to read this chapter

872
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
inspector goes out to a a unit in the

873
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,519
field

874
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,880
right how effective is that firing crew

875
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,799
how effective is that what's the

876
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,360
precision the rate of fire and and how

877
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,919
secure are they how mobile are they well

878
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
one of the questions on the checklist is

879
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
do they have their camouflage properly

880
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,039
erected

881
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,080
check yes camouflage is up it looks like

882
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,000
it's over the thing well the interesting

883
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,919
thing about camouflage these days and

884
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,240
the day of his writing was they have two

885
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,279
sides one for winter one for summer

886
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,600
but the question was an ask is the right

887
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,240
side showing up the question was just

888
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,159
asked is it erected yes

889
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,559
okay well my point is

890
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,519
i think that in the security industry we

891
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,200
can get drawn into

892
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,880
blind compliance pretty quickly

893
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,679
are we doing things

894
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,880
yes

895
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,120
are we doing them the right way

896
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,799
wait you just ask me if i'm doing it

897
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,840
right

898
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,080
we're good at that right

899
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,679
the military's good at creating

900
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,919
checklists and having inspections we

901
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,760
have a cyber readiness inspection that

902
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,039
we conduct

903
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,480
i've been through them on the receiving

904
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,519
end i've watched us now deploy our

905
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,240
experts out to check units and uh you

906
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,200
can get an 80

907
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,519
on that inspection that's a good grade

908
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,760
right got me through high school um you

909
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,519
can get an 80

910
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,880
um

911
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,679
you're still wide open to folks like you

912
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,480
so

913
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,240
you know this compliance idea to me i i

914
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,120
i'm struggling as i look at this team

915
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
i'm with and i'm like why are we we're

916
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,039
worried about are we doing this are we

917
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,120
doing that what's the outcome it's all

918
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,919
about risk right so we're trying to get

919
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,240
to this model of you know

920
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,000
compliance and risk and how does that

921
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
balance itself well i think left to its

922
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,480
own devices i know this from my 28 years

923
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,240
of experience in the army any

924
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,919
bureaucracy by definition and

925
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,440
unfortunately

926
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,519
you know we are part of one but any

927
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,200
bureaucracy there are great things there

928
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
are reasons bureaucracies exist but

929
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,960
after a while they creep towards

930
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,399
compliance

931
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,360
they

932
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,840
they would tend to do things that way

933
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,240
well my lesson is i can't allow that to

934
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
happen in a cyber formation i still need

935
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,240
oversight we're still going to behave

936
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,120
ethically we have rules and laws and all

937
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
those things and that's not what i'm

938
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
talking about i'm talking about

939
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
disciplined initiative

940
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,599
okay disciplined initiative is an idea

941
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,280
in the army that says

942
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
do you know enough to know when your

943
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,079
orders are no longer valid

944
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,599
and you're now going to do something

945
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,760
different do you know enough to identify

946
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,239
when the conditions have changed when

947
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,159
there is a new threat or a new

948
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,800
opportunity that you can seize and take

949
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,440
advantage of rather than wait to be told

950
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,918
do we know enough about what's happening

951
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,639
at our our borders with with attacks

952
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,239
happening to say

953
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,960
well

954
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,119
i i'm i'm going to move now laterally

955
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,599
and defend here rather than wait hey

956
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,000
five days later we were penetrated go

957
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,440
clean that up wait a minute i'm seeing

958
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
something happen again and the work that

959
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
we were doing

960
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,520
there was an operation

961
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,000
and a young officer

962
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,399
saw something as an opportunity

963
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,480
identified it

964
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,760
acted i was in the room acted did

965
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
something

966
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
the threat had changed

967
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
and in the world that you operate in i

968
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,480
don't imagine there's ever a day that

969
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,800
you could be working in cyberspace and

970
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,920
not have

971
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,560
the dynamic changing by definition it's

972
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
changing so rapidly

973
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,960
that we need folks to have this idea of

974
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
discipline initiative what i thought i

975
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
was going to see i'm not seeing or the

976
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,440
the network has changed or this threat

977
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
actor is moving much much faster what

978
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,640
used to be a day or two is now hours

979
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,680
right

980
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,560
so

981
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,480
we want this

982
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
but it's not necessarily easy to achieve

983
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,119
when compliance has its attractive

984
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,040
nature and i think compliance is

985
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,720
something that exists in and out of the

986
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
military i can impugn myself from my own

987
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,400
experience

988
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,960
uh about why you tend towards checklist

989
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,359
driven events but creating this

990
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,839
discipline initiative to me is something

991
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,839
that i think is going to keep us wholly

992
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,079
relevant in the space

993
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,240
and what you have to do is rather than

994
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
scrutinize that action of the young

995
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,640
officer you need to reward it

996
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,680
was it legal was it moral

997
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,359
in fact

998
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,920
held by a higher authority assuming the

999
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,079
risk i held that person responsible for

1000
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,400
action but i am going to be accountable

1001
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,040
for the risk if you do that well

1002
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,839
right judicious risk taking

1003
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,079
understanding that creating that force

1004
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,720
that's what we're working on in army

1005
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,760
cyber

1006
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,920
because if we don't

1007
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
we'll be too slow to be relevant in some

1008
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,079
spaces of cyberspace defense and offense

1009
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,079
right

1010
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,839
okay i have no more prizes to give but

1011
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,800
does anyone know who that is

1012
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
okay

1013
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,280
gustavo dudamel he is the

1014
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,560
conductor

1015
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,320
at that time of the la philharmonic

1016
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,240
and uh

1017
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,359
he was playing the violin

1018
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,440
up until age 18 and he dropped the

1019
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
violin and started to

1020
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,160
practice the art of conducting and he

1021
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,000
was somewhat of a prodigy if you will

1022
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
but he could

1023
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,320
he he was a master he was hired by the

1024
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,359
la philharmonic in his 20s

1025
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,880
and and so

1026
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,440
please don't take away that i think i'm

1027
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,960
that guy in the middle with the baton

1028
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,119
that's not the point of this slide the

1029
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,040
point of this slide are those musicians

1030
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,880
in the foreground

1031
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,839
they are masters because they have

1032
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,040
practiced yes indeed and i do think

1033
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,839
that

1034
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,040
mastery takes time but i'm not saying

1035
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,480
that if you conduct 10 000 hours of

1036
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,240
cyber you will be a master

1037
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
i believe that that mastery has to

1038
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
arrive by

1039
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
understanding it to the point where in

1040
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,119
the words of nina kohlers who is a

1041
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
she's written on innovation

1042
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,000
and and mastery

1043
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,520
has come to speak to parts of the

1044
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,599
department of defense and said you guys

1045
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,200
have this wrong it's not about how many

1046
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
times did you do it how well do you

1047
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,760
understand it we'd like to talk about

1048
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,599
you know think outside the box she would

1049
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,240
say no no no you have to understand the

1050
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,760
box so well that you can reconstruct it

1051
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
and so

1052
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
the picture to me is is a leader the

1053
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,880
conductor

1054
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,680
who

1055
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,000
understands music so well

1056
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
that he can construct it deconstruct it

1057
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,359
and reconstruct it and and my

1058
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,920
observation in a technical force is

1059
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,280
don't get

1060
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,079
don't get head faked by rank in the

1061
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,920
military or seniority in an org chart or

1062
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,400
uh pay levels whatever that you know

1063
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,079
whether it's your salary or your parking

1064
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,680
spot don't get head faked by any of that

1065
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,480
uh

1066
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
there are there are folks that i work

1067
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,200
with that i listen to that are

1068
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,680
sergeants first class

1069
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,560
right

1070
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,079
that um

1071
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,640
i listened to above

1072
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,280
many many people who the organization

1073
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
would have you well but he's a captain

1074
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
he's a major he's a lieutenant colonel

1075
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
he's a colonel

1076
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,839
i don't

1077
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,760
care bobby knows more than some of those

1078
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
people are ever gonna know about cyber

1079
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,200
there are people in the room bobby just

1080
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,119
happens to not be here there's some cute

1081
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,320
smiles in the back like are you gonna

1082
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,640
mention me no i'm not

1083
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,480
uh there are people in the middle who

1084
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,640
are those people to me you ask around

1085
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,000
about the people i go to talk to

1086
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,520
throughout the day

1087
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,920
it's not about rank i get invited to

1088
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,760
enough meetings with general fogarty i

1089
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,079
don't need more of them and and if he

1090
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,000
watches this on youtube

1091
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,400
i know why those meetings happen we we

1092
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,000
have a job to do to run this thing

1093
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,960
called army cyber but my point is

1094
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
don't don't allow an organization to

1095
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,400
head fake what's happening at the

1096
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
grassroots the mastery that might have

1097
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,000
been built people are now coming into

1098
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
our force that have years of experience

1099
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
in private industry

1100
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,119
that have vaulted them beyond what we

1101
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,800
would otherwise spend a couple years

1102
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
training and we need to recognize that

1103
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
and take advantage of it it's hard to do

1104
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,640
we do some things in the military but

1105
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,040
paul kraft at the cyber center is trying

1106
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,200
to open those apertures direct

1107
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,520
commissioning is a is an idea like that

1108
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,280
these summer internship programs are

1109
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,000
ideas like that this discourse right

1110
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
between things happening down at the

1111
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,760
georgia cyber center this university

1112
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,000
across the river university of south

1113
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,960
carolina besides itself these dialogues

1114
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,079
we've got to continue to do them

1115
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,280
because

1116
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,079
this mastery can't be brought about by

1117
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,000
ourselves we're experimenting with what

1118
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,760
it looks like to do training with

1119
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,480
industry at a more rapid rate

1120
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,960
to rather than say i'm going to send you

1121
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,800
to one company for one year why can't i

1122
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
send somebody out to a company and work

1123
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,800
with private industry for three months

1124
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,040
on a hard problem get around that you

1125
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
know spider web of talent

1126
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,680
learn what that looks like in practice

1127
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,760
and bring that back and help us solve

1128
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
heart problems and continue to do that

1129
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
and i think there's benefits to both

1130
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,640
sides of that relationship so

1131
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
uh that's that's

1132
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,920
what i would like to offer in terms of

1133
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,720
this

1134
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,200
thinking outside the box is interesting

1135
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,640
reconstructing the box is important

1136
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,160
uh and and my my lesson has been i've

1137
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
got to learn enough about the musicians

1138
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,760
in the foreground

1139
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,960
where i can collide them together

1140
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,200
and and make sure that what we're trying

1141
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,079
to have as an output

1142
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,920
sounds a little bit more like symphony

1143
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
and less like you know

1144
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,520
disconnectedness

1145
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,599
that's that's the effort so

1146
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,800
okay

1147
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,040
that's part two

1148
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
episode three

1149
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,119
oh yes thank you man um episode three

1150
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,880
uh

1151
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
three

1152
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,000
phrases

1153
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,839
taken from a book so the little footnote

1154
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,680
that's there that says

1155
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,000
you know it just says hey i read a book

1156
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
and i thought

1157
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
wait a minute i want to remember these

1158
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,359
three words

1159
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,040
i've i've just recently finished this

1160
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,319
book now

1161
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,160
it's not hard to read it's a short book

1162
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,319
but it's very very interesting the

1163
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,040
takeaway anybody speak russian persian

1164
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,319
farsi

1165
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,079
chinese

1166
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,319
which one

1167
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,960
what does it say

1168
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,720
yeah it's the three three warfares right

1169
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,480
so thank you um

1170
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,920
uh russian up top is uh

1171
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,720
you know the same idea about active

1172
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,760
measures in the middle uh persian farsi

1173
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,359
talking about the guardians of the

1174
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,240
cleric but all these ideas are about the

1175
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,079
condition we find ourselves i believe

1176
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,280
today

1177
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,000
are that we have some adversaries who

1178
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
think completely different about how to

1179
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,880
challenge the united states

1180
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,720
you know we've spent 20 years in and

1181
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,240
counter terrorism

1182
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,960
uh there's been some recent reflections

1183
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,920
upon that there's been recent changes in

1184
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,720
uh our presence and locations uh

1185
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,119
associated with that along the way we

1186
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,720
had some adversaries who were thinking

1187
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,400
how can i best challenge the united

1188
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,440
states

1189
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,480
below the level of armed conflict

1190
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,200
how can i make this difficult for them

1191
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,400
how can i

1192
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,839
start to get them to maybe question

1193
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,359
the efficacy of their own democracy

1194
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,960
how can i

1195
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,520
do things across a broad range in which

1196
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,760
cyber is an element it's not the only

1197
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,680
element in these

1198
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,480
theories of irregular warfare

1199
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,040
information warfare chinese include

1200
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,560
legal warfare

1201
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,240
so these ideas of our adversaries

1202
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,640
thinking deeply about how to impact

1203
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,480
the security

1204
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,359
and

1205
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,800
social structure of the united states

1206
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
isn't a new thing

1207
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,800
and and they're running at a pace

1208
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
that i think we would agree

1209
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,359
is somewhat daunting

1210
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,720
and we're thinking through what that

1211
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,400
means

1212
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,160
at the same time

1213
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,280
these are

1214
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,800
significant

1215
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,760
well

1216
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,240
equipped

1217
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,359
countries but the barrier to entry is

1218
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,640
low

1219
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,839
right

1220
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,839
that is the radio shack in gardez

1221
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,040
afghanistan 2011.

1222
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,119
next to the target which has better

1223
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
hours apparently it's open um but the

1224
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,880
barrier to entry in cyber is now low

1225
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,839
it doesn't take much right some of some

1226
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,160
of our adversaries are not large nation

1227
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,839
states you don't have to be a large

1228
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,640
nation state in order to compete or

1229
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,520
cause disruption in this space

1230
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,040
and i i

1231
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,119
some observations from that uh

1232
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,000
perspective the rate at which uh we are

1233
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,160
discovering uh

1234
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,160
uh zero days right that the the oh day

1235
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,960
numbers 66 in a year is that the is that

1236
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,079
the statistic uh that we could cite that

1237
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,520
is that happening

1238
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,880
uh because we're getting better at

1239
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,280
detecting them is that hack happening

1240
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
because there are more deployed are they

1241
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,520
being chained together to make life more

1242
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,839
difficult can we react to that what's

1243
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,520
the speed at which that market is uh

1244
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,119
having an effect

1245
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,920
so if you look at that big epiphany the

1246
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,359
second one is

1247
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,160
ransomware that that everybody in the

1248
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,920
room has been affected by the united

1249
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,680
states recently correct

1250
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,160
and you among many probably know that

1251
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,319
all too well in terms of the speed at

1252
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,200
which that is happening now

1253
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,200
and their targets yesterday

1254
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,280
uh night i watched a video

1255
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,240
uh jenna easterly uh talked a little bit

1256
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,079
about you know sissa she talked about

1257
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,160
the organization uh but really if you

1258
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,800
haven't watched it really really cogent

1259
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,640
summary about uh ransomware its impact

1260
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,119
and what we have to do together

1261
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,720
publicly and privately in order to

1262
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,200
remain relevant in that space

1263
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,960
to counter the impact of it but recently

1264
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,200
hospital targets you know hit lucrative

1265
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,680
target sensitive data

1266
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
but the speed i think of interest to

1267
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
those in the room the speed at which

1268
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,200
those things are happening

1269
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,599
penetrate establish the beachhead expand

1270
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,520
laterally persist

1271
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,880
deploy

1272
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,200
six hours five hours

1273
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,240
okay how do you combat that how do we

1274
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,839
combat that

1275
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,240
that that is uh that is a significant

1276
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,040
idea and then the idea of uh

1277
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,440
for us information

1278
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,040
uh or attribution of information is

1279
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,560
what are we doing to make sure we're

1280
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,839
sharing that

1281
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,359
and so i think there's been a little bit

1282
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,920
of a revolution in that idea between the

1283
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,680
government and private industry the

1284
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,640
strong

1285
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,240
important partnerships that the national

1286
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,400
security and cybercom have the

1287
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,960
notifications that are occurring uh

1288
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,839
because the idea of attribution in this

1289
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,400
space is becoming all the more important

1290
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,640
all the more difficult to detect but all

1291
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,280
the more important so from my vantage

1292
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,359
point uh the world obviously the pace

1293
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,680
at which our adversaries are trying to

1294
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,559
impact us the scope with which they're

1295
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,880
looking at it whether they are nation

1296
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
state or unknown actor

1297
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,640
whether they're a criminal or

1298
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,359
someone who has

1299
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,000
strategic objectives in mind

1300
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,839
all those things have changed the

1301
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,359
landscape and i don't think that's going

1302
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,200
to slow down at any time soon

1303
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,439
so

1304
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,720
a few things and this is where i'm just

1305
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,359
going to dangle some of these ideas so

1306
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,119
then the group here can go get their

1307
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,760
tech on you can go learn about uh i

1308
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,520
think there's raspberry pi going on

1309
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,000
there's uh windows management going on

1310
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,160
there

1311
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,000
nando's gonna talk about powershell

1312
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,520
that'll be awesome

1313
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,000
there's a lot happening

1314
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,319
in the future i think these are areas

1315
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,400
where we will have to continue to work

1316
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,319
together and collaborate you know a lot

1317
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,920
of you go to a lot of conferences and

1318
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,520
you hear talk about

1319
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
ai machine learning we talk about it

1320
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,359
internal to the department of defense

1321
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,359
department of the army quite a bit but

1322
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,119
what does it mean when applied how do we

1323
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,040
apply the ideas how are we going to

1324
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,880
apply it to vulnerability research so

1325
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
that we can get faster what are we going

1326
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,520
to do with the algorithms of defense so

1327
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,640
that if all the if if everything's being

1328
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,480
machine written these days or there's a

1329
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,559
lot being machine written how how do we

1330
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,480
apply that to get better at active

1331
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,960
defense so that our algorithms can be

1332
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,800
relevant faster and we can have the

1333
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,760
human mind solving other problems but

1334
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,440
guide this

1335
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,040
applied or

1336
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,319
mi

1337
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,960
al idea into algorithms with the data

1338
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,559
scientists that are tuned to the

1339
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,800
organization to mean relevant that's an

1340
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,119
area i think we're going to have to stay

1341
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,200
in partnership with trusted cloud

1342
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,920
solutions uh clearly there's a dod cloud

1343
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,559
strategy uh there's a lot in there in

1344
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,400
terms of what does that look like who

1345
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,079
secures the cloud who secures what's

1346
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,880
going on in the cloud right well

1347
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,800
somebody might secure the cloud but then

1348
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,720
when you're in it you've got your own

1349
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,480
conundrum but what does that look like

1350
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,559
for us how do you ultimately there's you

1351
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,599
know in the middle there in the

1352
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,359
information dominance thing we're always

1353
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,040
going to be in this privacy and security

1354
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,920
realm this this transparency versus you

1355
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,359
know do you lock everything down do you

1356
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,280
keep it open well there's mysteries

1357
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,880
about the cloud right just this big open

1358
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,480
thing well no

1359
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,880
it's probably uh overly secured in some

1360
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,520
areas and under another's

1361
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,960
information dominance and influence

1362
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,040
that's a term of art for us right now in

1363
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,640
the army information dominance

1364
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,960
information advantage uh but what does

1365
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,240
it look like

1366
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,920
you know security of elections there's

1367
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
an example there are actors who are

1368
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
trying to influence the confidence in

1369
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,680
u.s elections

1370
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,359
what is that what does that look like is

1371
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,880
that an information campaign does it

1372
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,960
involve cyber how are we participating

1373
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,160
in that what does it mean for social

1374
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,839
media space what do you trust and not

1375
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,240
trust how do we get along

1376
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,400
in that space to make sure that we are

1377
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,160
remaining uh

1378
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,880
unified in our idea about protecting the

1379
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
election privacy and security is always

1380
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,440
in balance and then imposing costs put

1381
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,680
in quotes because it is again something

1382
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,000
we talk about is what are we doing in

1383
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,200
this

1384
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,079
uh ecosystem of what an adversary is

1385
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,760
there's a there's a person there's

1386
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,160
infrastructure right there's there's

1387
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,920
ideas there's there's support how do you

1388
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,760
go after that how do you what parts of

1389
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,119
that are you going to siphon off to have

1390
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,040
an effect and how do we together

1391
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,760
privately publicly think about how are

1392
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,280
we imposing costs on those that are

1393
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
trying to do us harm so there are some

1394
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,680
areas that i would uh hope you would all

1395
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,599
take some time to think about what you

1396
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,280
can do to help us

1397
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,200
finally i'm going to leave with this

1398
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,319
this is a picture of a route clearance

1399
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,559
platoon well part of it

1400
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,480
four young men in this case who were

1401
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,040
getting their combat action badge

1402
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,640
standing in front of

1403
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,480
multi-million dollar vehicles that we

1404
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,079
use to go out and hunt

1405
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,000
less than multi-million dollar threats

1406
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,160
to u.s and allied soldiers called ieds

1407
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,319
these men and others and women went out

1408
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,720
on the roads of afghanistan every day

1409
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,200
doing route clearance

1410
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
why did they do it well they did it

1411
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
because of the person on their left and

1412
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,960
right or the person who's following in

1413
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,559
the next convoy

1414
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,160
all to

1415
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,960
meet

1416
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
the mission the mission they had was to

1417
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,559
help protect

1418
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,280
their brothers and sisters at arms well

1419
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,359
the mission right i go back to where i

1420
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,119
started i gave out some t-shirts i gave

1421
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,720
out some coffee mugs we talked about

1422
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,240
billion dollars of investment we talked

1423
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,800
about beautiful buildings and all that

1424
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,640
is important

1425
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,839
the two things that i would argue i hope

1426
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,000
i tried to convey and conveyed well

1427
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,800
enough the two difference makers

1428
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,359
the talent and the mission

1429
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,839
and again this is not an enlistment

1430
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,040
speech

1431
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,319
but we're onto something in army cyber

1432
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,880
we're attracting the right talent

1433
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,559
we're growing more we're training it

1434
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,359
we're trying as i talked about to apply

1435
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,040
making sure we don't fall victim to the

1436
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,000
wrong

1437
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
things about organizations and create an

1438
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,400
atmosphere where the mission will

1439
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,880
attract the talent will provide them the

1440
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,000
best weapons platform and will continue

1441
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,559
to work with all our partners put them

1442
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,119
out in industry bring them back have

1443
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,119
dialogues like this spend days weekends

1444
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,480
talking about what are we going to do

1445
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,359
together to make sure that we are more

1446
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,960
secure

1447
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,119
doing things at a rate of speed that is

1448
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,160
relevant

1449
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,920
and uh having an effect and imposing

1450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,760
cost on our adversaries

1451
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,760
i have six minutes remaining before she

1452
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,319
throws a football at my head

1453
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,800
what are your questions

1454
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,480
oh he has a question

1455
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,480
yeah

1456
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,000
yes are you in capo two or three

1457
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,480
okay which one

1458
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,839
okay

1459
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:22,720
oh

1460
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,400
okay just to be clear the national guard

1461
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,359
since

1462
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,000
okay so what his question is if you

1463
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,400
didn't hear it was um and he admits to

1464
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,839
the fact that he's asking an inside

1465
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,280
baseball question i think but he's

1466
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,640
saying

1467
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,800
what's going on with uh you know how

1468
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,520
does my plan fit with uh garden reserve

1469
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,680
national guard u.s army reserve

1470
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,880
it's a great and fair question

1471
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,440
and i should have mentioned it earlier

1472
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,119
in this case i'll give you an example

1473
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,440
the example is this underneath the

1474
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,599
operational control of the organization

1475
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,680
i work for there is a

1476
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,400
cyber warfare company of the national

1477
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,280
guard

1478
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,520
that is fully around you are you on that

1479
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,359
team

1480
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,240
no

1481
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,160
yeah yeah they're all up there okay so

1482
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,079
i'm explaining to you who you are but

1483
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,280
for the rest of the group so we we

1484
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,760
brought this team out of doing some

1485
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,640
incredible work in their civilian jobs

1486
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,800
right i haven't inventoried the new team

1487
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,400
they're coming in now there's one

1488
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
currently some of them work within the

1489
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,800
national security apparatus already some

1490
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,200
of them do pen testing in real life some

1491
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,440
of them just sit and do coding because

1492
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,880
that's a hobby but they're trying to get

1493
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,280
paid for but more often than not it's

1494
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,920
this really cool unique assemblage of

1495
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,480
talent that the army might not otherwise

1496
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,079
have gotten

1497
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,680
and they have years of experience they

1498
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,240
have a level of mastery that is unique

1499
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,400
and we call them up to active duty for a

1500
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,359
year

1501
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,520
and and we bring this company on and we

1502
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,280
employ them in

1503
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,960
our fight

1504
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,200
and they're doing some amazing work this

1505
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,920
particular the current company is has

1506
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,599
been uh the cwc the current cyber

1507
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,280
warfare company of the national guard

1508
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,440
has been involved in supporting

1509
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,960
operations and forward-deployed

1510
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,160
locations

1511
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,160
every day for the past year

1512
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,440
and the the if you talk to them their

1513
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,160
level of morale about what they're doing

1514
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,160
through the roof they'll stay at work

1515
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,160
they you don't have to tell them to stay

1516
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,839
at work you have to tell them to go home

1517
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,599
right we've moved them a couple times

1518
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,799
they don't care they don't care about

1519
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,880
the 336 million dollar building they

1520
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,240
want to operate

1521
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,680
they want to have an impact they want to

1522
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,440
contribute and they arrive with such

1523
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,599
tremendous talent so

1524
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,520
the strategy is

1525
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,280
we've got a plan where that's going to

1526
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,920
happen over time where general fogarty

1527
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,760
meets with the chief of the reserve and

1528
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,760
the national guard we're talking about

1529
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,720
what this looks like in the long term so

1530
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,319
the takeaway for everyone else in the

1531
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,920
room other than the people who now work

1532
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,839
for me

1533
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,280
is this

1534
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,720
if you want

1535
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,520
to connect to us we're not a mystery and

1536
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,200
if we are that's my fault and i'll fix

1537
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,760
it but

1538
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,200
if you want to

1539
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,119
join the national guard you can still do

1540
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,599
your civilian job great

1541
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,520
you know you'll come together a few

1542
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,599
times a year and one and we might

1543
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,680
activate for a year of service with

1544
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,920
joint force headquarters wonderful

1545
