00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,039
show me the money um i'm going to

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,640
introduce myself first because i like

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
myself a lot and i love talking about

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,519
myself so

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
there's my my mug with my mug i am a

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,880
virtual cso i was a solar practitioner

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
for a few years and i joined uh three

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
months ago a company called fractional

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
cso and all we do

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,239
is take small organizations in that 50

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,399
to 100 employee space

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,920
that are ready for cyber security

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,039
strategy

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
but not ready to hire cso and we

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,920
so

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
before i joined

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
cso i actually developed a whole bunch

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
of tools to help my clients let me

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,039
communicate with my clients who were not

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,520
security practitioners and what i found

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
is that they were very valuable for

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
people who are security practitioners

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
and need to be able to speak with

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
business users right so

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
um please feel free to follow me on

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,640
twitter you get the hot takes and the

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
 posting

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
linkedin you get the more professional

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
messaging

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,360
i want to point out i always do this

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
because i think it's very important

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
i'm a college dropout i dropped out of

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
auburn university i went to durham tech

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,040
community college i graduated from nc

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
state a public university with a degree

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,920
in textile chemistry of all things

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
and i did eventually find my way into

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,079
tech after being a research chemist for

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,479
a few months going wow this is cool but

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640
i was really interested in

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
networking lab equipment to

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
automatically dump data into a database

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,640
so i was like i'm in the wrong industry

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
i got into tech 10 15 years later i got

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
a masters of information and knowledge

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
strategy from columbia university so my

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,520
point here is

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
don't rule out college dropouts don't

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,960
require degrees don't require

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,719
certifications because my hope is that

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,160
one day everyone in this room if you're

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
not already a hiring manager you may

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,400
have that opportunity so

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,360
um

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
thank you

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
so at no point in my career did i go hey

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
i want to be a vc so that's a great idea

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
i actually like i said i was a research

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,879
chemist

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
i put myself through college doing um

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,440
web development and i eventually ended

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,319
up at a little startup one day

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
called fireeye and i was there for a

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
six-week contract and that's how i got

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
into security so

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
with that in mind i have spent a lot of

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
time in my career before fireeye and

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
before security

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
um

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
communicating high-tech concepts to

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
either high-tech audiences or to very

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
low-tech audiences so if you've ever

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,480
been to

78
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
support.netgear.com or help.netflix.com

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
i did with the back ends the front ends

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
and the writing style guides for those

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
help sites so that's my background once

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
i found security i found that i was

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,720
really good at communicating security

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
concepts to non-security people i've

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
spent my whole career in that squishy

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
space between technology and business

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
technology and non-technology

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
so i wanted to give you a little context

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
on why i think this is important i think

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,000
it's important because in the united

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,280
states alone much less the whole world

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
in the us alone there are 5.6 million

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,519
plus

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
small businesses and that's 500 or fewer

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,360
employees and this is of as of 2016 so i

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,799
don't know how the pandemic has affected

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,319
that number

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,760
of that the majority of those employees

99
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
of those organizations are less than 100

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,120
employees

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
and so we tend to hear from security and

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
vendors and fortune 500

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,879
companies and large-scale enterprises

104
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,879
that can afford to address security at

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,599
scale but what we don't hear from enough

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
are people who are helping those sub 500

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
employee spaces because it's a very

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,760
different model

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,799
and the other thing as security

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,319
practitioners and and the security

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,920
vendors like us to focus on the

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,399
technology and there's a lot of fun that

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
drives that technology purpose but what

114
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
you have to remember is that the data

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
we're protecting no matter the size of

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,880
the organization that data lives at the

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
intersection of people processes and

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,400
technology and you hear that phrase a

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
lot in security and you hear that phrase

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
a lot because that is a knowledge

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
strategy phrase knowledge strategy is

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
the science and the heart of aligning

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
people processes and technology

124
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
for business outcomes

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
so

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
in the legal profession which is another

127
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
knowledge industry they align people

128
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
processes and technology for legal

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
outcomes security aligns knowledge

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
processes and technology for secure

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
business outcomes or risk conscious

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
outcomes that's why you keep hearing

133
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,919
that phrase over and over again

134
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,520
we have to keep our focus on the data

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
i'm going to make

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
a slight assumption and i know never

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
make an assumption i'm going to assume

138
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
that you're all somewhat technical or

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,000
familiar with technology and we're going

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
to ignore that completely

141
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
because i don't think that's why you're

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
at this talk

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,600
you're at this talk because you want to

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
understand how do i talk to people so

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,039
we're going to focus in at first

146
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,479
on the people lens we're not going to

147
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,440
spend

148
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
too much time here

149
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
because that's another hour-long talk on

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
the psychology of getting people to do

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,080
what you want

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,960
but

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
the first thing i want you to know

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,039
people is that you are not your average

155
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
customer and you've heard that at

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,960
several talks today

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
you are not your average customer

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280
you are the security expert in the room

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,759
even if you're just an i.t person and

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
you have

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
you are the security expert in the room

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
i became a virtual cso not because i'm

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,160
great at identity management or threat

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
hunting or any kind of technical

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
capability i became a vcso because i was

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,680
acting as a virtual cto for a non-profit

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
in atlanta and i kept flagging security

168
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,759
i want them to hire a cso and i'm like

169
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
you guys have got to have somebody

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
dedicated to security you're supporting

171
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
2 400 museums archives and libraries

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
with digital services

173
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
you got to have somebody to cover that

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
space

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
and they were like oh well you seem to

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,840
know more about this than i do and then

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
we do

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
would you be our vc so

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,160
okay because for them i was the security

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
expert it just so happened that i was

181
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
very lucky

182
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,680
that six week contract that i took at a

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
little company called fireeye right

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
turned into a nearly five-year

185
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
employment with fireeye and that's where

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
i found my love of security and that's

187
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
where i met several people in this room

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
who are very kind and not heckling me

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
yet

190
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,400
but yes i actually ran

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
fire eyes communities

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,520
didn't know technology wasn't interested

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,479
in security

194
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,599
and those communities were getting

195
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,319
neglected so i've got my security

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,520
experience

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,759
through three years of helping random

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
security teams

199
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,919
solve random problems and sometimes

200
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
there were hardware problems and

201
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
sometimes they were product problems but

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
they were always security related

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
problems so when i took that vc server

204
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,840
role i was like okay i've got a passing

205
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
familiarity with nist and i've got some

206
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
other handy things like that i had

207
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,479
already gone and gotten my sisp because

208
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
i thought why not

209
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
yeah that seems like an interesting

210
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,879
space

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
yeah so

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,599
um yes you are not your average customer

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
even though i was not a paul nelson for

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
example i

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
knew more about security than they did

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,479
and more importantly i was more curious

217
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,758
and i was more willing to help

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
you

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,199
succeed building a security program

220
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
until others in your organization are

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
invested in your success that means that

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,039
you've got to figure out how to build

223
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,319
empathy

224
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,400
that means you have to be empathetic

225
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,360
right

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
you have to build collaboration you have

227
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,560
to make them feel like they are part of

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
the security process

229
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,599
and that means that you have to take a

230
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,399
lot of the jargon out of things right

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
you can't come in here and immediately

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
go we're going to go sock too and nist

233
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,240
and blonde blonde blah

234
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,519
they're like okay what does that mean

235
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,719
and what's that gonna cost and do we

236
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
really have to do it you know

237
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
um i'll show you the tool that i

238
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,080
used basically to get that buy-in in

239
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,480
just a moment

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
the last thing i want you to remember

241
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
about people

242
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,959
well not the last thing the last key

243
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,560
thing

244
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
any friction that you introduce to

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
somebody else's process or work is

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
immediately an obstacle

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
i have seen i.t organizations try to

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
turn on multi-factor authentication

249
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
and the level of drama

250
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
oh my god i have to pull out my phone

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
and click something so that i can log in

252
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
that was just ridiculous

253
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,360
but

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,640
it's because they're like hey we're

255
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,600
going to make this more secure we're

256
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,040
going to turn on mfa

257
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,920
and they never gave anyone the context

258
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,839
on what is important and why it's

259
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,480
important for you to do it

260
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
because

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,519
if you just tell somebody hey you know

262
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
security is a relay race

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
you start that race off with mfa and

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,080
then you run a little bit and then you

265
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
hand me the baton

266
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
and then i take it and i run a little

267
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
bit

268
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
you know when you make it something that

269
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
they are a part of

270
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
you know you using multi-factor

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
authentication is the single thing that

272
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
we can do as an organization

273
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
to protect ourselves from ransomware

274
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,000
make them a part of that process and

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,640
that friction is no longer an obstacle

276
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,600
they are now a part of the solution

277
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
so anytime that you're introducing an

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
extra step into somebody's workflow

279
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
you're an obstacle

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
so i want you to keep those three things

281
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
in mind when you deal with the people in

282
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
your organization

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
you need to learn as we said to

284
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
understand and empathize with your

285
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,880
audience

286
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
that means you have to understand what

287
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
they care about

288
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,680
your exec team

289
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
cares about operational costs

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,399
they are not just paying somebody a

291
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
hundred thousand dollars they are paying

292
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
somebody a hundred thousand dollars plus

293
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,959
the thirty 30 000 of overhead that it

294
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
takes to have that person's butt in a

295
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
seat or pay for

296
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
licensing for software or pay for

297
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,079
training and pay for travel if they're

298
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,839
remote they're paying other things

299
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
there's still operational overhead

300
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,800
so there are costs that are hidden to us

301
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
as has employees

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
that we start to learn about as we start

303
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
communicating more with that side of the

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
house

305
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
the other thing are risks right

306
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,120
and for for our purposes a risk is

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,279
anything that can put pressure on the

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,920
business that may spend you know change

309
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
the spending above and beyond the

310
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,680
expected operational costs so anything

311
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
that loses us money or makes us spend

312
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
money

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
that we weren't planning on losing or

314
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
spending

315
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
that is now a risk so

316
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
that's a business risk that's a very

317
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,279
different concept from what a security

318
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
risk is from you know an apt or a risk

319
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,240
assessment that we as security

320
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
professionals do so when we talk about

321
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
risk with the business side of the house

322
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
we need to understand that their

323
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
definition of risk is very different

324
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,079
from ours and don't just accept this

325
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,279
ask them

326
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
right hey this is how we think of risk

327
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
and security my understanding is that

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
business thinks of it this way is that

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
how you think of it now you've engaged

330
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
them in a conversation and they see that

331
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,440
you are trying to understand

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
what they're doing

333
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
now they're more interested in what

334
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
you're doing right

335
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
that's that building that that

336
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
investment in your success

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,279
if they understand what you need to be

338
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,560
successful

339
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
then they will be more bought in

340
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
your internal customers

341
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,279
are

342
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,959
whether they know it or not they're

343
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,120
constantly optimizing for work we want

344
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
to do more

345
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
with less effort right and that's why

346
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
when i say

347
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
any friction you introduce becomes an

348
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
obstacle it's because you're screwing

349
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
with their optimization of work

350
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,600
if i have to work harder even if it's an

351
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
imaginary work

352
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
you're now

353
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
you're not optimizing

354
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,639
my efforts

355
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,560
so you have to make sure that they

356
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
understand that everything that you're

357
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,240
asking them to do

358
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,800
go to a single sign-on portal to sign in

359
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
go do this

360
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
let us know when you're engaging

361
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,279
lucidcharts or whatever when you're

362
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,760
getting a third-party software you need

363
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
to make it not

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,800
i'm doing this to interrupt your

365
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
workflow you need to make it a part of

366
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,959
their workflow and you need to make it

367
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,560
so they want to tell you these things

368
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,600
because

369
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,040
eventually

370
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
you want to make it sound like i'm

371
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
making this so that it feels a little

372
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
painful now but in the long run

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
help you do less work or get more return

374
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,000
on your effort

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
recognition is

376
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,600
huge

377
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
we do not do it enough and that's

378
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
because we as several speakers have

379
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
already mentioned this weekend

380
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
we

381
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
think of ourselves as you know security

382
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,240
experts and i hear cow workers and i

383
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,279
hear stupid users and i hear the problem

384
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
exists between the chair and the

385
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
keyboard that's great

386
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,079
um

387
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,399
it's not helpful

388
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
people feel like you're talking down to

389
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
them you are you're being a bit arrogant

390
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
you're being a little condescending or

391
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
maybe a lot arrogant and a lot

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
condescending

393
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
the whole

394
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
part of that is that you're making them

395
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
tune out because if you feel like i'm

396
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,000
stupid why should i listen to you

397
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
shaming them

398
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
for doing

399
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,279
what they usually do what any human who

400
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,639
isn't a security person is going to do

401
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,639
recognize when they do what you consider

402
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
really basic things you know i think the

403
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
big

404
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
with that um

405
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,519
atlanta team

406
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,839
right this is a non-profit you had very

407
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
deeply technical

408
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,760
really wonderful people who were very

409
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
good at their job in it or in

410
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
development and you had really great

411
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,959
librarian types who were really great at

412
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,079
librarian things

413
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,680
but they're very smart they're just not

414
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
smart about security

415
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,000
so you've got to make sure that you

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
recognize when they do things that you

417
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
do want to encourage the biggest thing

418
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
that we did was we had a little in in

419
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
the all employee channel

420
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
once a week one of the it people went in

421
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,959
there and said hey thanks for sending us

422
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,519
this phishing email so and so

423
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,120
you were absolutely right

424
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
what they're doing is they're saying

425
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
you're a part of this process

426
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
you've made my job easier

427
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,519
you've helped protect the company you're

428
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,040
a part of this too

429
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
and i appreciate that

430
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
and that went

431
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
so much further than any cyber security

432
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
training i've ever seen i mean you need

433
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,519
the basic training don't get me wrong

434
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
but that weekly drip of

435
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
thank you you did this right

436
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,040
now everyone else sees it and now

437
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,279
everyone else learns and it's just this

438
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
wonderful little self-propelling you

439
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,639
know kind of

440
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,959
energy where now people feel more bought

441
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,480
in

442
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,399
and that brings us back to success how

443
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,560
do you become a part of their success so

444
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,759
that they can become a part of your

445
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,800
success

446
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
if you're recognizing them publicly for

447
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,800
doing the right thing even though it's

448
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,720
not their job

449
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,519
you've just made them more successful

450
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,120
and if you can actually make them

451
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,680
successful at their job

452
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
make them more successful there as well

453
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,680
you know that just makes everything

454
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,320
that much easier they now are more

455
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,399
interested in making sure that you are

456
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,240
successful

457
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,839
does that make sense i'm going to pause

458
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,959
there

459
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
are there any questions about

460
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,440
engaging people this is a little bit of

461
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
social engineering inside your own

462
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,800
company

463
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
is anyone uncomfortable or disagree with

464
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
that concept

465
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
okay i'm saying lots of no no that makes

466
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,959
sense okay

467
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,079
so

468
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
we're gonna go

469
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
right into the process lens and i know

470
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,079
i'm just chewing through this content

471
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
because this the next part is going to

472
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
take a little bit longer

473
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,600
i'm going to actually i'm going to give

474
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
you a demo in excel eventually but for

475
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
the moment

476
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,559
we're going to talk about the security

477
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
maturity model this is a model that i

478
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
developed

479
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
because i wanted to be able to say

480
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
to these wonderful business people who

481
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,079
have

482
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
no interest in technology or security

483
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,079
beyond we've hired what seemed to be

484
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,439
really good technical people and they

485
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,919
seem to be doing the right thing

486
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,679
i need to make that ceo and that cfo

487
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,039
understand

488
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,840
why we need a security budget

489
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,000
but that means i need to make them

490
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,280
understand

491
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
what not so great security looks like

492
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
versus pretty healthy security and i

493
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,559
don't want to make it bad versus good i

494
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,960
want to make it robust right i want to

495
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,559
make it healthy

496
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,559
this is not so healthy

497
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,240
like that's easy that's an easy concept

498
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
if i eat a candy bar for lunch that's

499
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,559
not so healthy if i eat a salad for

500
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,720
lunch that's healthy

501
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,440
when you frame security

502
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,919
in this way to a business

503
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,919
they really get it

504
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
i've gotten so much good feedback on

505
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,679
this

506
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
friends who are csos at very large

507
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,039
companies take this and use it i've had

508
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,520
friends who are customer success

509
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,840
managers at very large security vendors

510
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
take this and use it to train their

511
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
customer service team

512
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
so that they understand the pressures

513
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
that are on the business that they're

514
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
surveying right

515
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
i've had mandiant and talos

516
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,480
consultants share this with their people

517
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
that they serve so

518
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
it seems to be a pretty robust model

519
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
that applies not just to small

520
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,840
organizations but pretty

521
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,240
and i break it up by organ

522
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,799
this model i will say is in my github if

523
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,440
you go to to carlotus i think it's

524
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,559
hub.com carlota sage there is a show me

525
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
the money repository you can download

526
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,039
all of these models that i'm and

527
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,400
worksheet i'm going to share with you

528
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
today

529
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,559
and you can

530
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
customize them and use them in your own

531
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,559
organizations in whatever way is

532
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
meaningful for you

533
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,880
so

534
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,280
from that perspective i wanted to not

535
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,480
only show

536
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,760
what's healthy and what's not healthy i

537
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
wanted to show

538
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
the pressures that drive you in each

539
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,879
direction

540
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
it's like okay you've shown me what's

541
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,440
healthy and what's not healthy

542
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,080
and now you're asking me for a budget

543
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
and what does that really mean

544
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,080
here you go

545
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,799
here's how you move not just with

546
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,160
technology

547
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
here's how you move from less healthy to

548
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,919
healthy

549
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
all right and i'm going to attention

550
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,120
what we're really here for

551
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,559
is the money lens right because

552
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,360
when you're a very small organization

553
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
proving roi to get money

554
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,799
build your security program

555
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,960
if you're a security practitioner an i.t

556
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,120
person you maybe have never had to do

557
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
this maybe you've never had an econ

558
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
course maybe you never had a business

559
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
course in school this is something that

560
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
may be new to you maybe it's not but

561
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
hopefully it will make sense

562
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,400
i started with a simple roi calculator

563
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
and actually

564
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,150
i'm going to show it to you

565
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,679
[Music]

566
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
if you if you download

567
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,799
the risk and recovery

568
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
worksheets

569
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
from my github

570
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,200
you can go and play with these and i

571
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
tried to be on this risk and recovery

572
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
model that way and big in this

573
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
oh

574
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,240
i don't know

575
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,039
up left ah there we go

576
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,360
there we go all right

577
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,240
i've tried to be as descriptive in these

578
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,159
worksheets as possible so that you can

579
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,080
share them with anyone

580
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,320
you just have to enter your information

581
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
in the purple spaces

582
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
and then we'll automatically crunch

583
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,158
numbers

584
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,919
so

585
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,120
there's my roi

586
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
okay i'm gonna have to go back

587
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
i actually didn't download my own um

588
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,159
roi model so i'm gonna have to go back

589
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,840
to that hang on

590
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
come on

591
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,799
all right so on the roi model that i did

592
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,360
not download my apologies and that is

593
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
not in the risk and recovery estimate

594
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,320
the roi model is very simple it's about

595
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,360
efficiency and productivity if i have 80

596
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,240
employees who make 80 000 a year

597
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,159
and i think i can save them 15 minutes a

598
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,600
day

599
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,080
right and my total project cost is only

600
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
a hundred thousand

601
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,039
then my roi is in six months

602
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,400
all you have to do is fill in the green

603
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,919
boxes on this one

604
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,520
and it will actually populate everything

605
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,480
else

606
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
so if you want if you are proposing a

607
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,960
project that is going to cost more than

608
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
productivity saved

609
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,559
you're probably not going to get the

610
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,440
money for it right

611
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
you want

612
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
the number that two hundred thousand

613
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
dollars you want that savings to be

614
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
bigger than whatever you're proposing it

615
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,240
really is that simple if i can shave a

616
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
minute

617
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,200
a day off of a thousand employees times

618
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,080
by optimizing an internal search engine

619
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,360
to search

620
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,159
15 to 25 content repositories in a 3 000

621
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,840
person company

622
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,799
then

623
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,960
my roi in that particular case was about

624
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,080
4 months because i actually did that

625
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,440
right

626
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
it becomes a very compelling argument

627
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
and it's an easy thing for people to buy

628
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
into i'm not saying that i'm going to

629
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
save you days of effort

630
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,039
i'm i'm spreading it over realistically

631
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,360
maybe that's one team maybe that's a

632
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
whole organization depending on who

633
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
you're talking about

634
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,120
but

635
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,799
you've got to be realistic you've got to

636
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,000
get them to agree i knew in my heart and

637
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,679
in my number crunching and then all of

638
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,360
the the data that i pulled from the

639
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
search engines that i could save those

640
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,600
teams 30 minutes a day because there

641
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
literally were 24 different 25 different

642
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,760
content repositories but because i only

643
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
said i wanted to save people 15 minutes

644
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,080
a day or one minute a day i got much

645
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
easier buy in on that

646
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,000
and then

647
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,200
legendary but to a cfo they don't to me

648
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,159
and you

649
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
it feels kind of like oh that's okay

650
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,279
is that really really no money

651
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,840
to a cfo this is really money and if

652
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
they don't agree with your premise

653
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,559
they'll tell you

654
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,679
and they'll tell you what they think

655
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
that premise should be and then you can

656
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,200
change the formula

657
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
and update the spreadsheet everybody's

658
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
happy like the biggest pushback i've

659
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
ever gotten was on this arc calculator

660
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
and it was a sales going nobody's gonna

661
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,279
believe that i was like okay take it to

662
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,960
a cfo and find out i've never had a cfo

663
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,400
push back

664
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,279
on the money part or the concept i've

665
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,600
had them adjust things

666
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,960
but when you give them something like

667
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,440
this it's a lot easier to speak their

668
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,720
language it's it may feel unnatural for

669
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,520
you

670
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,240
but productivity is a real thing that

671
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,039
cfos worry about right

672
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,880
so

673
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,120
any questions on the roi calculator is

674
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
anyone does it is anyone here because

675
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,039
that's just not possible that's not

676
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
realistic

677
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,840
oh okay cool no sales engineers now

678
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,840
[Laughter]

679
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,120
um i used that roi calculator

680
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,640
and um adrian sinabria i believe

681
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
once posted several times it's posted to

682
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,279
twitter and shared

683
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,760
a calculation

684
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
and i've got the link at the back of the

685
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
worksheet on how to to estimate the

686
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
money that you're spending on

687
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,039
a single incident

688
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,080
his concept and my concept and i smushed

689
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
them together and i said okay we can

690
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,480
actually

691
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,240
really get a lot of information about

692
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
how an incident can affect an entire

693
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,240
organization so he was looking at how

694
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,919
much money are you spending on the

695
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,400
incident response has a security team

696
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
and i'm saying okay that's that's good

697
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,400
information to know but how much money

698
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,200
are we losing in productivity

699
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,039
potential service renewals or that kind

700
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
of thing so here's where i'm going to

701
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
pull up

702
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
this fancy worksheet that i put together

703
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,159
for you

704
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,039
so

705
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,679
so that said you know in real life if

706
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,360
i've got something

707
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,760
an incident that

708
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,559
you know

709
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,760
takes

710
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,520
60 minutes

711
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,720
maybe my

712
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,039
internal portal for something

713
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,880
my internal portal to the crm or

714
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,039
something is down for 60 minutes how

715
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,279
much money am i really losing

716
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,039
in productivity

717
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,960
because then if if that happens once a

718
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
year maybe we're willing to accept that

719
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,320
risk but if that's happening continually

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
now you can say okay

721
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,880
well

722
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,200
three thousand dollars

723
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
eleven thousand total not that big a

724
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
deal it's a big deal if you're a small

725
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,799
organization

726
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,080
if you make

727
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
you know a couple hundred thousand a

728
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,880
month

729
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,279
and you're a non-profit that eleven

730
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,520
thousand dollars is a really big deal if

731
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
you're an enterprise organization you

732
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,679
can change those numbers i mean maybe

733
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,600
maybe your help desk is 300 people or

734
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
your customer support center is a

735
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,080
thousand people you put those numbers in

736
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
you can get a good idea of how much

737
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,440
things really cost you in terms of time

738
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
loss if i am if people are not hammering

739
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
on their keyboard for an hour

740
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,679
how much money am i really losing

741
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,200
i also did this from a service

742
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
perspective so if i am in this

743
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,799
particular case

744
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,840
a

745
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
web provider

746
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,200
this is a content

747
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
service

748
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,240
and

749
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,799
my sites get ddosed i get you know i

750
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
lose 5 000 a day

751
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,559
220 an hour you know

752
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:30,000
370 a minute

753
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,559
and if you're a non-profit again that 5

754
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,039
000 a day starts to kind of add up

755
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
money adding up in their head

756
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
the bigger the problem the bigger that

757
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,520
number right now if i'm down for

758
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,840
well

759
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,880
right

760
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
so that service disruption is up top

761
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,120
support impact estimates if you are a

762
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
service provider you probably offer

763
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,039
customer support

764
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,440
and maybe you only get

765
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,640
usually

766
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,520
200 200 cases a day

767
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,399
okay that's in your operational model

768
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
now you're suddenly getting an extra 150

769
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,919
cases

770
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,320
that you weren't expecting to you

771
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
weren't expecting to have to pay that

772
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,720
money

773
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
when you're in support in a support

774
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
operations role you know how

775
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
contact costs your organization when i

776
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
worked at netgear a phone call to

777
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,760
netgear cost 18

778
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,919
i knew that i knew that because we could

779
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,399
divide how much money we were spending

780
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,159
by how many how many phone calls we were

781
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,360
getting in a day

782
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,640
and you know

783
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,559
there you go every phone call costs

784
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,559
eighteen dollars if i can save ten phone

785
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,440
calls

786
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,880
a day i save a hundred and eighty

787
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,039
dollars a day that math becomes very

788
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
simple and a support organization

789
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,799
because you have tickets and you're

790
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
tracking all of that

791
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
so

792
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
incident response so support is one

793
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
thing you can also make that a customer

794
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
service thing there are a lot of ways

795
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
you can apply that model to other parts

796
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
of your organization

797
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
on your incident response how much is my

798
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,159
network engineer my service delivery

799
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
engineer my security analyst change

800
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,880
those to whatever is meaningful for you

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,919
fix

802
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,200
the salaries how many people you have

803
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,039
whatever that number is

804
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,440
is your number right

805
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
and the recovery costs how many new

806
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
employees do i need to hire what's the

807
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,039
average salary i'm going to spend on

808
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,399
those

809
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
what's that cost of labor how much did

810
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,240
it cost me to change my platform when

811
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,799
that platform i was using got hosed

812
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,600
right

813
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,559
i mean if your wordpress blog gets hosed

814
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,760
and you were thinking about changing the

815
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
platform maybe you'd already budgeted

816
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
for it great if you hadn't is what it's

817
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,679
gonna

818
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
how much does it cost me to train people

819
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,279
on whatever has happened whatever change

820
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,600
i now have to make how much money do i

821
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,840
need to spend on pr or on internal

822
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,200
communications those are all numbers

823
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
that you track

824
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,320
talk to your cfo they'll give them to

825
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
you right so

826
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,080
you know maybe the total spent on

827
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
recovery here is eighteen thousand plus

828
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
another fifteen hundred plus another

829
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,200
fifteen hundred

830
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
you know plus whatever you're losing on

831
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
the service side those numbers start

832
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
that up you can see the cfos doing the

833
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,799
the calculations in their head

834
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,559
does this make sense i've tried to put a

835
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,159
lot of like i said i tried to put a lot

836
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,399
of explanation in the boxes so that

837
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,440
again

838
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,360
this is a conversation starter if you

839
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
take this to your cfo and go you know

840
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,039
somebody gave this to me it seems to

841
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,559
make sense to me does it make sense to

842
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,600
you let's talk about this

843
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
now when you give them these kinds of

844
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,919
numbers now you can say

845
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,200
there is a cost associated right

846
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,960
with responding to an incident that may

847
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
not be obvious

848
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,039
we'll go through some other numbers in a

849
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,480
minute but

850
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,399
we also have

851
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,799
some application development stuff

852
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,760
really simple model

853
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
ransomware

854
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,200
this is not a calculator

855
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
there is i think in the notes on this

856
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
worksheet there is a link to a

857
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,679
consulting group that does have a

858
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,360
calculator that's based on their own

859
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,720
customer base

860
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,760
you know you tell them how many

861
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,159
endpoints you have and you know whatever

862
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,679
theoretical problem has happened they'll

863
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,320
tell you an estimate of what that

864
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,000
incident will cost you i don't know how

865
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
accurate that is i don't have that

866
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,760
insight so i i'm not going to show that

867
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,640
off per se but what i want

868
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,440
your cfo and your ceo to understand is

869
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,399
that there is a cost associated with not

870
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159
doing security so now you've shown them

871
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,799
the cost of doing security you've shown

872
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,519
them the cost of an incident

873
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,640
here's what it's going to cost

874
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,120
potentially if we don't do security and

875
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,399
we end up

876
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,720
in one of the fbi's you know

877
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,679
bec reports or

878
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,159
yeah there's a lot of stuff here sofa

879
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,600
secure world i think it was um

880
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,360
sofos who has a really fantastic

881
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,919
market uh research that was done they

882
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,159
went to an outside firm and said we want

883
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
to do research to cover even people who

884
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,640
aren't our our clients

885
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,559
and they went out and did it and they

886
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,480
have all of this great information

887
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
they update that report regularly it's

888
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,880
worth going to look um and i'm pretty

889
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,760
sure i've included a link in the notes

890
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
so if you

891
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,399
click over to the helpful resources

892
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,000
you've got some of those things that

893
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
i've i've researched as well

894
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,720
let's zoom this in a little bit more

895
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,600
yeah

896
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,679
so

897
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,519
that's just a really quick and dirty

898
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,480
walk through that excel file is there

899
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
anything there that makes people go

900
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
that doesn't make sense or does it feel

901
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
pretty natural

902
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,440
because i feel like even for security

903
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
practitioners who aren't

904
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,200
you know math geniuses i'm not

905
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,799
this felt good not only did it feel good

906
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,039
it

907
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,600
it was a good enough conversation piece

908
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,000
that i've never had to to go to any of

909
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,840
those other outside resources i've

910
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,360
always taken that security maturity

911
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
model and i've taken those risk

912
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,559
estimates

913
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,279
recovery estimates and pretty much

914
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,399
gotten what i needed out of that

915
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,120
that's the show me the money part so

916
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,320
there are other tools that i'm gonna

917
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,399
show you since i have plenty of time

918
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,320
and i could talk more about myself but

919
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,600
you're here to learn

920
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
uh i'm gonna bounce back to the security

921
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,440
maturity model because once you've shown

922
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
those numbers

923
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
now you come back and you can say okay

924
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,919
you know

925
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,880
if we want to talk about technology

926
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,760
and

927
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,960
here's where

928
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,039
x amount of spend will get us

929
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,679
and you can figure that out with your ce

930
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,320
ceo and cfo on how much they want to

931
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,000
spend where they want to be now the

932
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,840
security maturity model is fantastic

933
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,200
i've gotten tremendous huge amounts of

934
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,640
really great feedback and i really

935
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
appreciate it in fact i think like half

936
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,600
the people of this room have given me

937
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,918
feedback about it

938
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,159
there is a more simplified version that

939
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,960
fits onto a slide deck so that if you're

940
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,280
having to present for some reason to the

941
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,119
c-suite or to the board

942
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,119
you can take that more complicated model

943
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,679
and make it a little more accessible

944
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,000
i like it it's a little dumbed down

945
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,839
i would definitely start with the bigger

946
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,079
one

947
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,679
but more importantly

948
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,560
you can take that bigger one

949
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,040
and you can really operationalize it so

950
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,679
it's great to say hey my organization

951
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,040
is healthy

952
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,119
not healthy whatever

953
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,918
how do i move from one side of healthy

954
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,359
to the other or not healthy too healthy

955
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,918
and everything that we've done in that

956
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,719
organizational model we can now pull in

957
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,040
that had ad hoc compliance driven risk

958
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,119
base we now pull that in

959
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,280
and we make a one to five scale out of

960
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,079
it

961
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,119
right

962
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,359
and you can put in your different

963
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
teams that you're using

964
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,520
and you can decide whatever is

965
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,960
meaningful for you in terms of

966
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
cross-functional relationships cyber

967
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,640
security operations

968
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,160
you know on those cross-functional

969
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,440
relationships i always start with

970
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
business alignment because if you're not

971
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,560
talking to the business and

972
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,320
understanding what they need you can't

973
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,960
secure them right because you don't know

974
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
what data

975
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
they really care about you may have

976
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,560
plenty of access to databases but maybe

977
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,000
that's not where the data they actually

978
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
care about lives you know we talk a lot

979
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,079
about shadow i.t

980
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,000
because everything is cloud first these

981
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,839
days and if you're not cloud first you

982
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,920
know people feel free to be cloud-first

983
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,320
on their own you know lucidchart is

984
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
great about calling you and going hey

985
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,079
you have 30 people in your organization

986
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,680
using lucidchart don't you want to buy

987
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,599
an enterprise subscription

988
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,880
yes you do because that actually does

989
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
reduce your cost but more importantly

990
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
you've just found out that 30 people are

991
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
using lucidchart maybe they never told

992
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,240
you that

993
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,320
i have one client that manages

994
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
everything they have gotten really good

995
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,599
they've they have driven their culture

996
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,079
to one login everything goes into one

997
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,880
login you need to put every password you

998
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
have in one login if it is related to

999
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
this business

1000
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,720
put it in one login so when i went to

1001
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,960
them and said great you know how are we

1002
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
managing vendors for you

1003
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,880
well

1004
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,520
who are your vendors uh

1005
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,480
right

1006
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,400
so here's what you do

1007
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
you go to your one login and you dump

1008
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,359
out

1009
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,200
everything

1010
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,280
are people saving their passwords to and

1011
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
then you also go to your cfo and your

1012
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,800
finance team and you get a dump of who

1013
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,480
you're paying and between those two

1014
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
things you get a really good idea

1015
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,760
of your vendor

1016
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,640
list that you now have to manage yay raw

1017
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,760
but

1018
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,839
that business alignment what are you

1019
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,800
doing

1020
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,320
where are you doing it

1021
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,240
like i like to call the business up and

1022
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,359
say or do a zoom meeting now right

1023
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,000
hey walk me through your typical week i

1024
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,160
don't come at them with security crap i

1025
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,280
go you come in you sit down you fire up

1026
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,000
slack you check your mail what happens

1027
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
next

1028
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
oh well you know we did this and that

1029
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,599
every conversation i've ever had with a

1030
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,000
team that first conversation

1031
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,079
their it team finds all kinds of things

1032
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,160
that they didn't know there's at least

1033
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,760
one application that people are using

1034
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
that it had no insight into right or

1035
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
security hadn't well most of these orgs

1036
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,480
don't have security i'm the security

1037
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,040
right so those very casual conversations

1038
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,960
can be very

1039
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,040
want to keep that tone friendly you want

1040
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,800
to make sure i'm not here to change

1041
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,560
anything you're doing i don't care if

1042
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,720
you're sharing passwords right now

1043
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,599
we'll get to that so i just need to

1044
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,560
understand how you do your job so i make

1045
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,880
sure i don't screw anything up

1046
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
and when you approach it from that way

1047
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,480
people are like oh

1048
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,640
oh you just don't want to mess my day up

1049
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,119
that's great yeah let's talk about that

1050
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,320
all right great

1051
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
you're sharing one password across five

1052
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
people okay that's fine

1053
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,800
you know look if the license is a buck

1054
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,400
go ahead and get the license if it's

1055
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,079
more than that let's have a discussion

1056
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,560
later but for the moment could you at

1057
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
least put that password into the

1058
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,520
password manager

1059
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,720
because

1060
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,480
it'd be really nice

1061
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,920
if we're only sharing it with five

1062
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,000
people and not five others who've left

1063
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
the company

1064
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,320
oh

1065
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,480
yeah okay that makes sense like

1066
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,160
i'm not asking you

1067
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,839
to stop or change what you're doing

1068
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
other than let's just put in the

1069
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
password manager so we can change that

1070
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,320
password and the people who need it have

1071
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,280
access to it it's that simple and people

1072
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
are so positive when you come in with

1073
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,280
that attitude i don't want to screw

1074
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
anything up i just need to understand

1075
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,640
what you're doing so i don't screw

1076
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,760
anything up

1077
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,160
and people really like that

1078
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
and because they understand you're

1079
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,079
trying to make them successful but you

1080
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,520
can't make them successful if you don't

1081
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,359
know what they're doing

1082
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
the other thing that comes out of those

1083
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,599
conversations is you can see where

1084
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,480
different groups are maybe leveraging

1085
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,079
similar tools

1086
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,440
that you can automate some of that

1087
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,680
workflow through or maybe they're using

1088
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,880
the same tool and they're using it in

1089
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,640
very different ways

1090
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,800
and there's some efficiency that you can

1091
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,720
teach one group that you've learned from

1092
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,280
the other there are a lot of gains to be

1093
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,599
had and just sitting down with people

1094
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,359
and figuring out what it is they do

1095
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,920
okay

1096
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,079
that is the maturity model

1097
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,599
the other thing i have

1098
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,880
for anyone and this is kind of i thought

1099
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
about making this show me the money talk

1100
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
because originally it was just about

1101
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,599
those those

1102
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,599
two worksheets the roi worksheet and the

1103
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,920
risk and recovery worksheets it's

1104
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,599
evolved obviously because i put together

1105
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,359
the security maturity models

1106
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,920
um i've also four four people

1107
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,599
have put together a real simple one-year

1108
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,640
strategy sheet your one year strategy

1109
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
is just

1110
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,280
taking again those pieces that we

1111
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,880
talk about in the maturity model and

1112
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
there's a bit of repetition here

1113
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,560
when you when you use the same concept

1114
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
over and over again the business starts

1115
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,200
to get it right

1116
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
and you just say what your goals are for

1117
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,480
that first year doesn't have to be very

1118
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
fancy right

1119
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,640
it's just what am i trying to achieve

1120
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,119
this year don't worry about next year

1121
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,880
don't worry about four years i'll show

1122
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,079
you how to worry about that in just a

1123
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,960
second

1124
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,319
but

1125
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,560
when you're talking about

1126
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,400
strategy and you're not used to that

1127
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,880
maybe when you're when you're doing tech

1128
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
hands-on tech stuff now you have to

1129
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,599
pivot to strategy

1130
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,319
onto your business side they'll coach

1131
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,839
you through this

1132
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,839
they'll help you because again now

1133
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,240
you're saying hey i need to put together

1134
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,319
a strategy not really sure if i'm doing

1135
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,319
it right now you're making them invested

1136
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,920
in your success

1137
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
right

1138
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,920
i think that this is what we need to do

1139
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,480
and they can talk through that with you

1140
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
and now they also know your strategy

1141
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,280
before you have to go to any kind of

1142
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,920
meeting right and you have a chance for

1143
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,280
somebody who

1144
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,440
who maybe has more experience in

1145
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
building those strategies in those

1146
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,640
one-year strategies they can take a look

1147
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,079
at this and help you through it

1148
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,200
i also had a request at some point

1149
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,720
for a road map

1150
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,480
and this is still a little bit in flux

1151
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,760
and this is actually

1152
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,520
uh

1153
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,599
this was originally made for a 150

1154
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,560
person actually 100 organization

1155
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,079
but they had a lot of different things

1156
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,800
going on so i wanted to separate out for

1157
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,599
them

1158
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,599
their business systems

1159
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,560
from their

1160
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,319
communication collaboration systems

1161
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,960
which were mostly public facing

1162
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,880
the cloud services that they were using

1163
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,119
to run their their content management

1164
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,400
hosting

1165
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,079
and their application development

1166
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,520
because they also did mobile

1167
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,119
applications so

1168
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,720
even though there were only 100 people

1169
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,800
they had these four major

1170
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,560
things going on that you all kind of

1171
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,319
have to treat a little bit differently

1172
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,240
so when i originally made a road map for

1173
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
their ceo

1174
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,000
i had to take into account all of these

1175
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,760
different things

1176
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,680
i've tried again to use this

1177
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,520
cross-functional relationship security

1178
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,839
operations external relationships and

1179
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,280
i've tried to give you just a hint of

1180
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,800
what each of those are

1181
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,319
what security needs to know about the

1182
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,400
business and then i give you if you

1183
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
hover over the comment

1184
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,359
i actually give you a little more detail

1185
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,839
um

1186
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,240
so

1187
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,720
let's see

1188
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
so your year one let's make this a

1189
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,520
little bit bigger

1190
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
my other favorite i've had one pushback

1191
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,720
on this

1192
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,640
and that pushback was adversaries don't

1193
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,200
care about your roadmap and i'm like

1194
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,839
you're absolutely right and your ceo

1195
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,200
doesn't care about your adversaries

1196
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,880
either so you've got to put this roadmap

1197
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,640
together you're like you you can't

1198
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,560
escape that if you want money from

1199
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,760
someone because now they're going to

1200
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,520
want to know okay i'm giving you a bunch

1201
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,119
of money for tooling that's great for

1202
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,680
training awesome um how am i getting

1203
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,520
metrics back on that how do i know if

1204
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,440
the money i'm giving you

1205
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,960
giving you

1206
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,760
is being spent correctly and that we're

1207
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,560
seeing success out of that so

1208
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,119
a lot of that comes down to

1209
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,880
you know okay you're not going to see a

1210
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,720
lot of success in the first year boss

1211
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,319
because you know we're gonna spend all

1212
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,960
that time setting everything up and all

1213
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,040
of that and then then we have to get

1214
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,079
into some

1215
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,599
ongoing you know continuous improvement

1216
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,240
stuff this is very generic i've tried to

1217
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,079
make this very generic for a reason

1218
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,760
because i want you to come in and i want

1219
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,200
you to fill it out for what's meaningful

1220
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,520
for your ceo and cfo

1221
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,680
right they're they're going to tell you

1222
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
what what's important to them

1223
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,040
right

1224
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,440
you may not know the metrics

1225
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,680
tie the metrics to what they care about

1226
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,280
like

1227
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,760
if what they care about is selling more

1228
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
subscriptions to their content

1229
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,319
management system service great

1230
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,440
let's figure out how getting sock 2

1231
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,160
actually might enable sales

1232
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,000
and one of the things i did to figure

1233
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,040
that out was let's look at our crm and

1234
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,119
see how many

1235
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,440
leads we lose because we don't have sock

1236
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,400
2

1237
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,960
and i literally

1238
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,359
made the sales team change everything

1239
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,720
they were doing change everything they

1240
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,040
were doing no i had them add a field for

1241
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,720
sock two and if if a potential prospect

1242
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,960
asked are you sock two compliant before

1243
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,040
i move all of my precious museum

1244
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,520
artifacts into your content management

1245
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,680
system or at least pictures of them

1246
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,920
before i spend all of this money and

1247
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
time adopting your content management

1248
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,000
system and using your service are you

1249
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,839
sock too

1250
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,359
they were losing out on 150 to 250 000

1251
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,599
deals because they weren't

1252
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,520
now you have data and you can go back to

1253
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
the ceo and say okay i talked to the

1254
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,319
sales team last quarter

1255
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,280
we could not speak to these clients or

1256
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,960
potential clients because we were not

1257
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,440
sucked too and that was a million

1258
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,359
dollars in the funnel that might have

1259
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,319
only netted us 150 000 but that's

1260
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,760
a million dollars in the funnel that we

1261
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
just did not have access to at all

1262
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
very compelling reason

1263
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,240
to get your sock too

1264
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,960
beyond we have to do it or it's best

1265
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,000
practice

1266
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,920
now it's actually a part of your sales

1267
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,280
conversation

1268
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,119
and more and more organizations are

1269
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,680
asking that of smaller orgs because they

1270
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,240
do see that as a minimum you must be

1271
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,319
this tall for me to ride the ride you

1272
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,280
know

1273
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,160
for you to push my cart right i need you

1274
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,480
to at least stop too compliant because

1275
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,400
that at least tells me

1276
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
has a larger organization that you that

1277
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
you're thinking about security in a way

1278
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,160
that's meaningful to me

1279
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,680
and it's a simple checkbox

1280
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,400
and people are using it now that's great

1281
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
that's great that these larger

1282
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,240
organizations are holding these smaller

1283
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,319
organizations accountable but it also

1284
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,240
means that these small organizations are

1285
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,599
having to think about security a lot

1286
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,640
sooner than they would have 10 years ago

1287
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,680
we saw a huge influx in

1288
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,560
we at professional cso saw a big influx

1289
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,440
of

1290
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,000
customers in the sas platform space a

1291
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,400
few years ago because they were starting

1292
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,480
to they hit a certain size they hit a

1293
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,319
certain kind of tractability in their

1294
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,359
market and the bigger guys take a take

1295
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,200
note of them and now they're getting the

1296
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,960
calls from the bigger companies and

1297
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,720
that's one of their questions are you a

1298
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,119
sock too compliant do you have a cso you

1299
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,720
have some really basic security

1300
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,760
questions

1301
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,079
oh well we'll go call a fractional cso

1302
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,520
type of people and we'll go get that

1303
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,319
done

1304
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,680
now we're seeing it with the e-commerce

1305
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,599
platforms now we're going to see it i'm

1306
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,119
sure every couple of years some

1307
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,280
different market segment it's going to

1308
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,680
become really popular

1309
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,359
we're also seeing a lot of cyber

1310
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,319
insurance companies when they turn down

1311
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,560
or cancel someone's cyber insurance

1312
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,319
they're saying you don't have a cso and

1313
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,480
you don't seem to have a security plan

1314
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,880
and we get leads out of that

1315
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,040
so

1316
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,559
bringing it back here

1317
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,040
your ceo

1318
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,559
wants to know

1319
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,000
okay great i'm throwing money at you

1320
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,960
today

1321
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
what's that get me in the next one to

1322
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,280
three to four years i put four on here i

1323
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,480
think i'm gonna trim it down to three

1324
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,200
but

1325
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,119
in the next one to three years

1326
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,200
what can i expect to see how does that

1327
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,760
move the needle on that maturity model

1328
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,599
you know what do we do

1329
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,160
these are exactly what i built to talk

1330
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,000
to that customer that non-profit in

1331
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
atlanta i still use them now that i'm a

1332
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,760
with a larger vcso group

1333
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,559
these been really helpful for me

1334
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,200
i hope they're very helpful for you

1335
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,920
so

1336
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,440
that's really

1337
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,839
it for me

1338
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,880
unless you have some questions

1339
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,400
i see i see mr steffen

1340
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,880
do you have a question

1341
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,720
that's a more and more i will say it's

1342
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,160
becoming more and more popular

1343
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,359
especially

1344
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,520
um for the very small aggressive

1345
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,400
cloud-first companies right because

1346
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,920
they're able to spin everything up and

1347
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,720
down a lot faster so they're able we see

1348
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,599
customers go from like 50 to 150 you

1349
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,520
know triple their company size in space

1350
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,640
of a year

1351
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,240
and it's because they're going

1352
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,680
targets and those bigger targets are

1353
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,359
asking for that it becomes like 50

1354
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,040
percent almost of their their funnel

1355
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,160
sometimes

1356
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,119
right um and answering the building a

1357
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,079
pool

1358
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,720
of security questions for your

1359
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,960
sales team has become

1360
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,240
pretty much a request from every

1361
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,359
customer

1362
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,160
right

1363
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,680
because we're very clear we will not be

1364
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,680
your big desk not going to sit there and

1365
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,359
fill out security applications for you

1366
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,160
all day i hope you make a questions and

1367
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,119
answers that hopefully i'll give your

1368
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,359
sales team enough training enough

1369
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,280
awareness training that they hopefully

1370
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,119
can map those answers to whatever

1371
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,599
customer questionnaires and then will

1372
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,280
any questions that aren't answered we'll

1373
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
do the one-offs on a regular basis but

1374
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,319
pretty much every customer now would do

1375
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,000
full of questions for the sales team

1376
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,040
so

1377
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,480
thank you that's a good question yes

1378
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,680
that's a really good question we are

1379
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,920
almost never going straight to healthy

1380
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,880
usually comes to us uh they're going

1381
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,240
coming because somebody's asked them for

1382
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,359
compliance and it's usually a customer

1383
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,160
we're seeing investors ask for it now

1384
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
so they're almost always coming to us

1385
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,599
wanting immediately to be in that

1386
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,520
compliance column here i'm going to pull

1387
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,079
that back up

1388
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,319
come on

1389
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,440
the other thing is

1390
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,119
we tell people they may be in different

1391
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,280
spaces right they may already be doing

1392
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,240
some compliance stuff but they're still

1393
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,920
doing certain things that are in the

1394
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,720
unhealthy or less healthy side so that

1395
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,280
we've taken to like hitting a chat

1396
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,000
putting a check in the different columns

1397
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,880
sometimes they're all over the place but

1398
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,960
their leadership is decided because

1399
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,160
their leadership is willing to spend

1400
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,520
money on us

1401
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,559
right

1402
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,280
uh their leadership is already starting

1403
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,119
to move to this box or

1404
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,240
or up here this organizing principle

1405
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,680
leadership

1406
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,920
loves seeing that they have at least one

1407
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,079
check in that green column because if

1408
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,359
you come to us and you're willing to

1409
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,480
spend the money

1410
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,720
on a part-time cso basically and a

1411
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,720
security analyst to go through your

1412
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,760
stuff

1413
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,839
you're way ahead you're moving in that

1414
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,680
healthy direction so we put it we give

1415
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,200
them that check box

1416
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,359
um

1417
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,880
we're not brutal like they've already

1418
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,119
signed the check by the time we start

1419
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,119
talking about this model so we don't

1420
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,480
have to be mean about it we're not

1421
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,040
trying to use fud to sell anything right

1422
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,359
um but we are very honest with them and

1423
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,839
it's like okay you're doing it this way

1424
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,079
and it's working right now but we've

1425
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,000
seen other clients in that space that if

1426
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,400
they don't move in this you know amount

1427
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
of time

1428
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,960
you know this this project essentially

1429
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,480
fails

1430
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,800
if you stop community communicating with

1431
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,720
us guess what

1432
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,480
we have a clause in our contract that

1433
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,520
will cancel your contract like

1434
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,359
if we don't want we don't want you to

1435
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,160
get breached either but more importantly

1436
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,920
if you stop speaking to us for six

1437
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,359
months and we have no insight to what

1438
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,800
you're doing we don't want to be

1439
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,559
associated with you when you do get

1440
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,640
breached because we know it's coming

1441
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,440
right

1442
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,240
and we just try to to beat that drama of

1443
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,640
everyone yes everyone is at risk yes but

1444
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,880
you're doing some right things and the

1445
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,480
fact that you're talking to us at all is

1446
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,559
pretty good sign

1447
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,200
so yeah that they can be anywhere in

1448
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,640
this map it's not it's not straight down

1449
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,839
they can be

1450
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,599
like i said they're often coming to us

1451
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,760
somewhere between that that red and pink

1452
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,760
red and yellow column

1453
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,040
and i've got one client that is already

1454
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,559
somewhere like i've been working with

1455
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,839
them for two weeks i'm still in the

1456
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,000
discovery process right and i can

1457
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,359
already see they're between the yellow

1458
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,800
and green

1459
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
which is great because for the average

1460
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,680
client average it takes me nine months

1461
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,000
to get through that discovery process

1462
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,920
get the gap analysis done once i've done

1463
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,400
that you're here i want to get you to

1464
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,240
this space that means that we have to do

1465
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,599
a bunch of

1466
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,240
of policy development and a bunch of

1467
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,720
program work that nobody wants to do

1468
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,559
we've got templates for that it speeds

1469
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,280
it up but to get them from where they

1470
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,359
are to where they're ready to start

1471
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,280
talking about sock two

1472
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,920
is about nine months now

1473
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,920
that client that's already in that

1474
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,319
yellow to green space i've only been

1475
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,680
working with them for a couple of weeks

1476
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
but they're really tight

1477
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,240
and working on that gap analysis but i

1478
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
imagine it's probably only going to be

1479
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,839
three to four months

1480
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,839
because they are already doing so many

1481
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,920
things right so that means that gives us

1482
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,480
more capacity to do other projects with

1483
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,960
them once we get them to that minimum

1484
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,839
level

1485
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,440
any more questions

1486
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,480
