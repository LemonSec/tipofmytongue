1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,840
all right

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,360
so thank you for the introduction i do

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
appreciate it and uh and looking across

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
the room here i i do acknowledge the

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,800
fact that uh i believe i'm a speed bump

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
on your way out of here possibly um on

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
the last speaker you know it's it's uh

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,000
whenever they put you on the last slot

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,439
you're like wow they maybe they they put

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,080
me there to anchor the conference or

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,119
they're like hey we really don't want to

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,320
hear this guy talk so let's just throw

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
him at the other day maybe he'll get you

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,680
know a few people in there anyways i do

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,200
appreciate the opportunity to speak to

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
everyone i do appreciate everyone's time

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,320
um here in the room because i do know

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
you had uh you had decisions to make

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
across the talk so i do appreciate

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
the time you're going to devote to me

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,520
here

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
so i'm spending the next 45 minutes to

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,600
kind of talk about my my research here

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
and the stock is called who win wear and

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
a cheap hardware solution to develop

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,600
pattern of life

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,039
additionally i'm going to talk a little

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
bit about the uh the lessons learned

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,359
while conducting this research

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,360
because again i started off with a great

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,680
idea and as i kind of unfold this in

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
front of you

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119
we might laugh we might cry or you may

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,720
laugh i may cry but we'll see we'll get

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
there right there are a lot of lessons i

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
learned here um

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,880
and route to this

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
before i kick off i just want to mention

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
kind of my process here was

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
typically i kind of build a whole idea

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
and then i i get to the point where i

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,159
want to present it in a talk conference

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,960
um this one is a little backwards um i

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
took a friend of mine's approach to uh

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
challenge development and he picks a

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
name first and then he writes a

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
challenge around that name and so that's

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
when i kind of went here thinking this

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,479
is a great idea there's got to be this

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,159
has got to be a new avenue

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
for people to approach with hardware

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
i learned a lesson here and so i'll kind

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,399
of share that with you as we go

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,000
so this is the agenda this is kind of my

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,520
talking points here

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,479
that i'm going to cover i'm going to

57
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,920
tell you a little bit about me and

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
that's not really the grandiose piece

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,799
that's just so i can kind of let you

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,040
know like where i come from and why i'm

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
approaching what i'm doing here um i'm

62
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,399
going to talk a little bit about the why

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,920
right um essentially you know i

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,439
identified a problem

65
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
and um i wanted to kind of solve this

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
problem then i'm going to dip into the

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
design process that i use to kind of get

68
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
after this and kind of dissect the the

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,319
problem

70
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
some of the unique technologies um that

71
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,360
are that are both old and new

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
in this particular talk i'm going to

73
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
talk my development

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,400
process

75
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
show you a demo then we're going to talk

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
lesson learns and then kind of future

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,440
work close it out with like hey i know i

78
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
stumbled a little bit in my research i

79
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,080
know i stumbled a little bit into the

80
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
application of these ideas however

81
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,560
i do see some avenues where i can go

82
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
ahead and take this to the next level

83
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
before i jump into my the meat of my

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,239
slides here i do want to say

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,519
i like to keep it

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,280
marginally interactive so don't think um

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
so if you have a question please raise

88
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,319
your hand while i'm in the middle of the

89
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
talk i would rather address the question

90
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,840
in the context of the information i've

91
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
already presented that way we can all

92
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
learn as we go

93
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,239
so don't don't think you need to wait

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,920
until the end of the com name my talk to

95
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
go and ask a question i don't mind being

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
interrupted

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
yes

98
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720
okay

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,319
perfect we got an alpha

100
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
an alpha card for wi-fi sniffing and a

101
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
practical iot hacking

102
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
on theme for the talk i appreciate it

103
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
fantastic

104
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,360
all right so a little bit about myself

105
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640

106
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,799
twitters there um first and foremost i'm

a husband and father of four um i am a

108
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
cyber officer in the army as you kind of

109
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,799
seen this theme here you heard albert

110
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,440
alberto earlier he was a prior officer

111
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
i do a lot of programming in my spare

112
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,680
time focus a lot on on python i am one

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
of the executive directors and founders

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
of the runcode.ninja programming

115
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
challenge nonprofit we are going to be

116
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
running a competition here in november

117
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
um if you're interested check it out on

118
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
runcode.ninja

119
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
and then um with my copious amounts of

120
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
spare time i do like to uh spend some

121
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
time reviving old technology right so

122
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
i revive 1980 technology and also

123
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,159
collect 80s and 90s video games for

124
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
those of you that's like the atari

125
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
collegial vision and television going

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,879
way back the stuff you kind of see in

127
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,439
museums nowadays

128
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,560
and then all the way there at the bottom

129
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
in the fine print

130
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
just know that kind of the views and

131
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
everything i'm talking about here do not

132
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
represent the views of my employer i

133
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
just kind of got to throw that out there

134
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,798
no official policy this is all research

135
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,639
conducted in my spare time

136
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,840
so just kind of keep that in mind as we

137
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
move through here

138
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
all right

139
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
the why

140
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
so before um

141
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
i start to do the research before i

142
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
start do the the development

143
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
what i need to do is kind of a little

144
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
bit of a gap analysis

145
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
right and so that gap analysis is really

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
taking a look at what i can do or sorry

147
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
what i want to do

148
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
and then compare that to what i actually

149
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,880
can do

150
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
right

151
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,880
and that intersection

152
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
hopefully in a perfect world that's a

153
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,759
venn diagram right you have a little

154
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,120
intersection in the middle there you're

155
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
like ah this is what i want to do this

156
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,479
is what i can do i'm going to live right

157
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
there in the middle and focus my

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
research there sometimes it doesn't work

159
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,440
that way sometimes it does but that's

160
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,840
kind of where i start um when i start

161
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
when i when i do my research so in this

162
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
particular instance

163
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,919
what i wanted was i wanted to prove

164
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,479
individuals were on the network

165
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,600
and then i thought well how can i

166
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
actually do that well i can sit out you

167
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
know i can sit in the parking lot in my

168
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
car or the camera

169
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,039
and take pictures and that's only just a

170
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,199
tad creepy

171
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,039
but i'm like well wait a second i do

172
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,560
like to do a little tinkering i do like

173
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
to build small devices you know i do

174
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
some wi-fi research on my own i'm like

175
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,880
wait a second wait maybe i can prove

176
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
people are in the network

177
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
by just seeing i'm seeing people's

178
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
mobile devices their phones you know

179
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
passed by the entrance to a building

180
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,720
so i'm like perfect that's what i want

181
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,759
to do i want to prove they're on the

182
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
network by taking a look at the data

183
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
that's leaked out of your phone

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
as it sits there and looks for wireless

185
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
networks

186
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,759
and so there that was kind of the crux

187
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
of my idea here build a pattern of life

188
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
sensor for transient devices at a static

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
location so again transient devices

190
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
being mobile phones in a static location

191
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
being that entrance to the building now

192
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
again there's some assumptions being

193
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
made there right

194
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
those assumptions are

195
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,479
the everyone who walks through that door

196
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,360
is eventually going to get on the

197
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
network

198
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
again those are assumptions i can go

199
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,520
ahead and kind of stock away for maybe

200
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
another iteration of this problem but

201
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
initially i just wanted to prove that

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,120
people were walking through that front

203
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
door with the assumption that they'll

204
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,840
eventually get on the network in that

205
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,159
building

206
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
so from the y i transitioned to the

207
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
design process itself

208
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
so initially i wanted a small device

209
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
that i could go ahead and just toss

210
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
somewhere

211
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,919
right so don't nothing clunky something

212
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,440
small enough to where i can toss in some

213
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,759
bushes i can set under a doormat i can

214
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
sit around somewhere so it it doesn't

215
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
stick out it's hard to see

216
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,199
but in doing so there's a chance that

217
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
someone may see it so i also want it to

218
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
be

219
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
cheap i want to be able to have it be

220
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
disposable and so if someone sees that

221
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,479
and says oh cool here's something with

222
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,599
an antenna i'm going to take it home and

223
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,080
see what's going on with it

224
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
i'm out 20

225
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
which may or may not be a big budget but

226
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
if you're looking at pen testing or any

227
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
sort of thing like that it's really you

228
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
know that's not that much in terms of

229
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
the the price you pay for tools and some

230
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
of the

231
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
the pre-made stuff out there

232
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,319
in addition to that i wanted to be able

233
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,280
to

234
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
move the data that i'm finding

235
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,880
right so just having that device at the

236
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
front door the building

237
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
does me no good because then i have to

238
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
sit there

239
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
maybe they'll see that usb cable run

240
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
over to the bush with my laptop as i'm

241
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
waiting for the data to come in right

242
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
that doesn't look odd so i need to be

243
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,800
able to move that data wirelessly

244
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
to somewhere else so i need some long

245
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
distance communication vectors

246
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,400
to go ahead and continue to solve this

247
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,319
problem

248
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
additionally it needs to have low power

249
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,440
consumption

250
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
because again i want it to be small and

251
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,639
conspicuous you know if i throw it out

252
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
there at the 12 volt car car battery

253
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,599
again

254
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
may cause some questions raised some

255
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
issues so i want to have low power

256
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,759
consumption so i can put it on the least

257
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,000
amount of battery power possible and

258
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
again back to that just kind of toss it

259
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
into the bush toss it in the corner and

260
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
it doesn't raise any issues

261
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
and then finally

262
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
once i've got the data once i've

263
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,800
backhauled the data somewhere else i

264
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,520
want to be able to centralize that data

265
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
and then process it and do some

266
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
aggregation against it do that analysis

267
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
to go ahead and look at it because again

268
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,120
we're looking at a lot of potential

269
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,319
information coming back so i want to

270
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
bring it all to one one area so i can

271
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,240
look at it or i can share to share it

272
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
with others to look at it as well so

273
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
that was kind of the initial design

274
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
process that i applied against this as i

275
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,360
started to to kind of work the problem

276
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,640
then it caused me to build this neat

277
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
little diagram right here okay let me go

278
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
ahead and just draw it out

279
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
and so i can visualize it right so i

280
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,480
kind of broke it out into three

281
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
different sections i wanted to sense the

282
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
data

283
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
i wanted to move the data and then i

284
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,279
wanted to present the data and so once i

285
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,320
did that

286
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,640
i was then able to think okay

287
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,320
now i've got some smaller chunks to my

288
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,839
problem to solve

289
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,560
i can solve the sensing piece

290
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
i can solve the move piece and i can

291
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,160
solve the presentation piece with uh

292
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,360
with different technologies and

293
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
different approaches

294
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,959
and you see there on the bottom

295
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,440
the sensing piece identified i can go

296
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
ahead and use an esp32 microcontroller

297
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
for those particular sensors

298
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,160
and if you don't know what that is i'll

299
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,839
talk a little bit about here in a second

300
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,519
so you can also kind of we all kind of

301
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,680
level set our understanding of that

302
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
for the move piece i identified that i

303
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
want to do long haul

304
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
potentially low bandwidth low power

305
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,839
consumption

306
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
communications so identified loracom's

307
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,839
or laura communications lorowan right

308
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
long-range long-range um

309
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
communications there and then finally

310
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
the presentation piece so again like i

311
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
said i mentioned my intro i'm a python

312
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
programmer you know by trade and also

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,519
you know deep in my heart

314
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
so every problem in my eyes can always

315
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
be solved with python so again i can

316
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
build a flask website to go ahead and

317
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
and receive that data and then aggregate

318
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
the data and present it back out

319
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
moving on to the technology piece so now

320
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
that we've talked the the

321
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
the design piece i'm going to talk about

322
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
the different technologies involved

323
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
and then kind of give you a little idea

324
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,279
to kind of like i said level set our

325
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,800
understanding of what we're looking at

326
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,600
here

327
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
so initially there were three

328
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
technologies that i was looking at to

329
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
you i was looking to use two that were

330
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
new to me and one was kind of old to me

331
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,040
the first one is the esp32 development

332
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
board right so a microcontroller board

333
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
the second was the lower the lower

334
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
communications and then finally the old

335
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,160
one because i've done some work with

336
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
with alpha cards i've done some work

337
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
with with wireless sniffing

338
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
the wi-fi piece to it

339
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
so the esp32 development board

340
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
relatively cheap

341
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,320
it's uh it's an iot focused development

342
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
board it's dual core

343
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
most most um

344
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,600
applications you've run on it only use a

345
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
single core it's got four megs of memory

346
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
sorry four makes a flash memory it lists

347
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,560
it has wi-fi 802 to 802.11 bgn hd40 it

348
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,519
also has dual mode bluetooth

349
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,120
and then down there at the bottom almost

350
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
at the bottom the power regulator is

351
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
built in

352
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,519
so that that's that was a key piece that

353
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,120
i was looking for so that allows me to

354
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,160
use

355
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,200
pretty much any type of battery i want

356
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
if you've ever worked with any small

357
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
device before you know that they are

358
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
very susceptible

359
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
and very very uh it's very susceptible

360
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
to changes in power cons or to power

361
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
that you're inputting into it

362
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,079
however with this one with the power

363
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,240
regulator built in

364
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
i could put a series of double a

365
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
batteries on there it'd be fine

366
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
i could throw a nine volt on there it'd

367
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
be fine so again i'm not i'm not

368
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
restricted to to providing it the exact

369
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,279
voltage that it needs i can give it more

370
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
and have it still run

371
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
and then of course as with all things i

372
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
like to do when i start off i ended up

373
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,279
buying the cadillac of boards right so i

374
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
got a there's an oled display on it and

375
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,160
then it had the lower rand lorawan radio

376
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
so when i first built out the sensor

377
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
this is this is about the size so again

378
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
it doesn't show up in there that little

379
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
green box right there is the size of the

380
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
uh the esp32 development board so

381
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,839
relatively small

382
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,519
the second technology so again that was

383
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,240
the sense piece this is the move piece

384
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
so lorawan is a long-range wide area

385
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,839
network

386
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
and

387
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,600
it can push data

388
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,240
approximately two to eight kilometers

389
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
right out of these little tiny radios

390
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,519
now again

391
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,600
i say that with the uh you know a little

392
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
bit of a

393
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
caveat there

394
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
it's still a radio

395
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
and it still has limitations right so

396
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
terrain based so

397
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,079
point to point it can probably make that

398
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,519
you're trying to send data through walls

399
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,560
through buildings in an urban

400
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,839
environment

401
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
your signal deck is going to degrade um

402
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,760
a lot so just keep that in mind but it

403
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
can go approximately two to eight two to

404
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,519
eight kilometers

405
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,720
however

406
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
that long distance you pay a price it is

407
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
low bandwidth

408
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,160
so depending on your settings and

409
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
depending on the factors you apply when

410
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,440
you first set up your your lora

411
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
communications

412
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
um you either you can get as low as 300

413
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,639
bits per second

414
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,880
all the way up to 37.5 kilobits per

415
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,839
second

416
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,680
which is really not not that much

417
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,959
however

418
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,160
again depending on what you're trying to

419
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,519
do with it in my case i'm just looking

420
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,399
at

421
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,680
packets

422
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
and pushing a little bit of data so

423
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
to me that wasn't that big of a big of a

424
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,959
deal

425
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,200
the lora technology is also

426
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
interference resistant

427
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
so it uses what's called a chirp spread

428
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
spectrum

429
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
which is really kind of a unique way for

430
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,480
it to to

431
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,639
work against the interference so every

432
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,720
time it pushes out a little bit of data

433
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,000
it sends it out in little chirps they

434
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
call it and those trips maintain the

435
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
amplitude but then change the frequency

436
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
so the frequency will start off wider

437
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
and then get closer as it gets gets to

438
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,279
the end of the chirp

439
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,720
and finally laura is also low power so

440
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
as it's pushing that long range in the

441
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
low bandwidth it's not utilizing that

442
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
much power to push it over that long

443
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,279
range so again it

444
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,880
allows you to maintain the battery life

445
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,199
in addition the lower radials can also

446
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
put the device into a deep sleep so if

447
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,839
it's not pushing any sort of information

448
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,839
it can then sip it stand back and just

449
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,600
go to a very very low power consumption

450
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,120
mode and maintain itself

451
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,560
now moving on into kind of the problem

452
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,800
decomposition piece

453
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,680
so

454
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
the first part was the build

455
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
so when i say problem decomposition what

456
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,399
i'm looking at is let me take a look at

457
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,800
this very this difficult problem

458
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,279
and try to decompose it into solvable

459
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
chunks

460
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,160
now this was a lesson learned this was a

461
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
kind of a hard lesson for me here

462
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,480
because again as with some things i do

463
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
and maybe some of you out here do the

464
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
same thing you know i approach a problem

465
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
with a little bit of hubris i'm like

466
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,160
i've done this before i've tinkered

467
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,920
before this is easy let me just go ahead

468
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
and just slam all the code together

469
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
hit compile

470
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
and then try to load up the board while

471
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,839
i put all the code together i hit

472
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
compile and it failed

473
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,399
failed with a lot of errors

474
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,120
and so i was like wait a second i've got

475
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
lora communications i've got wi-fi

476
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
sniffing i've got you know http post

477
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,720
requests going on where is it failing i

478
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
don't know so i took a step back instead

479
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
of flipping my desk take a step back i'm

480
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
like wait a second let me get a little

481
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
smart about this

482
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,720
and build a better approach so i did

483
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
some problem decomposition you know sat

484
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,480
down with some markers and and some some

485
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
white you know some paper and just drew

486
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
out the problem and said okay what can i

487
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,680
solve first

488
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,880
and then i'm like let me just do the

489
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
wi-fi sniffing code first let me just

490
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
build that

491
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
simple or pull that from somewhere else

492
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,040
because again there's some repos out

493
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
there where you can go and find these as

494
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,839
solid problems

495
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
and so i built that out i was just

496
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,399
printing that out to the serial out on

497
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
the board so that way i can test and say

498
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,320
okay am i actually seeing networks

499
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
around my house

500
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
perfect

501
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
then i shelved that

502
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
and i said okay let me just get the door

503
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
radios talking to each other or at least

504
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,480
talking one way you know send a receiver

505
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,399
perfect so i went ahead and found some

506
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
example code for that and then i just

507
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,720
had to increment a simple counter packet

508
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,880
sent packet received

509
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
boom

510
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,279
and again nothing else nothing more than

511
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,440
that and then work that until it was

512
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
done

513
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
took that out shelved it

514
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
and i'm like okay let's figure out how

515
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,440
to connect

516
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
the esp32 to wi-fi same thing i had to

517
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,399
connect to my access point

518
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,680
figured up

519
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,199
perfect very little small sip of the

520
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
code shelved it and then finally the

521
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
http json post request so again

522
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
decompose the problem

523
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,120
into several steps and then once i was

524
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
done with that

525
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
then we layered them

526
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
right so then i had i'm going to do the

527
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
sniffing code

528
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,279
loracoms

529
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,959
works together perfect

530
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
sniffing code loracom's pushing the mac

531
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
address that i was seeing

532
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,440
okay still good and then laura comes

533
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
pushing the mac address receiving it

534
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,399
and then put you know building an http

535
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,839
request and like i said it was a kind of

536
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,839
an incremental process so that way if

537
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,360
something went wrong

538
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,199
i knew it was an issue with the code i

539
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
had i had added since i last updated so

540
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
i was good like i said didn't have to

541
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
flip a desk during that process

542
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
however it did take a little extra time

543
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,520
and so just know that when you try to do

544
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,359
when you do any starting problem

545
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,640
decomposition

546
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
you do

547
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
eventually or you do extend the time you

548
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
you uh you work to solve the problem

549
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
however it pays dividends

550
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,039
on the next piece

551
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,840
in the build out

552
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
writing the code i found out hey this is

553
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
a little different process i'm using

554
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,440
arduino sketch

555
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,360
has anyone here used uh are doing the

556
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,039
sketch before i got a few folks out

557
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
there perfect

558
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,919
so again you you open a new file you're

559
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,760
like oh it's blank

560
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
but you got some some curly braces in

561
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
there some mustache brackets and you're

562
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
like how do i start

563
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,400
well if you take again take a step back

564
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
and think i cannot be the only person

565
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,679
who thought who has thought of this

566
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,880
problem before so i hit up the google

567
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,960
search for esp32 wi-fi sniffer boom get

568
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320
up coughed up a repo for me perfect

569
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,760
and then i'm like okay

570
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
how do i figure out the lower code

571
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,039
again the board i bought the helltech

572
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,840
company actually had libraries built in

573
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
with their once you updated your arduino

574
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,280
sketches

575
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
and then example libraries so you can

576
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
just go ahead boom pull them down and

577
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,799
pre-popu populate them into your sketch

578
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
environment

579
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,559
the other piece that i learned too and

580
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,880
again for those of you who are are

581
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
radio gurus or smees or whatever i

582
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
apologize up front i am not

583
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,679
all i know is that the antenna has a

584
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,039
direct impact

585
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,919
to the transmission distance

586
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,600
fair enough right however i don't know

587
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,200
if my antennas are are tuned to the 9 15

588
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,120
megahertz frequency i don't know any of

589
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
that so that was more of a that was on

590
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
me that's something that i have to to

591
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
work to kind of get better at

592
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
but again part of that build process was

593
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,360
identifying that was a gap it worked

594
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
good enough for me

595
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
however moving forward i'll go ahead and

596
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
try to work that a little better

597
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,520
so that was the build process

598
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,960
now going into the collect piece right

599
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,919
how do i go and find those those packets

600
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,400
to go ahead and sniff and pull out the

601
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
appropriate information that i want

602
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,080
so

603
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,360
i fell on

604
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,720
probe requests

605
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
what are some other does anyone have any

606
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,360
other ideas of what i could have been

607
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,280
looking for at this point

608
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,720
do you even know the other other data

609
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,080
types for the management frames

610
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,480
no one

611
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,799
what's that

612
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,240
clear to saying clearly there's a couple

613
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
of beacons

614
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,679
right so there's also beacon packets if

615
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,960
you heard that before

616
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,039
so so again this was kind of a decision

617
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,840
that i had to make do i look for probes

618
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
or do i look for beacons so again this

619
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
kicked off a little mini thread of

620
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
research for me to go in there and look

621
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,919
and you know found some some difference

622
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,640
there and i'm like okay so beacon

623
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
just just for the

624
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,679
for the crowd here

625
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
the beacon request

626
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
is your device

627
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,679
i'm sorry is the actual access point

628
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,159
saying i'm here i'm ready to accept

629
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,320
connections this is my ssid here are my

630
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
settings

631
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,480
but think about my initial charter my

632
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
initial kind of problem though i'm not

633
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,120
looking for that i'm looking for

634
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,400
transient devices

635
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
devices that are moving so i'm assuming

636
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
you it's a phone

637
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
or some other communications device that

638
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,440
they have on their body

639
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
i'm not going to see any beacons from

640
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,600
that

641
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
so then i kept looking kept researching

642
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
and i found probe requests so the probe

643
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,720
request is your phone or your device

644
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
saying

645
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,360
hey

646
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,159
i'm looking for an open access point

647
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,200
right and there's a couple of different

648
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
types of pro requests and a couple of

649
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,240
different ways for them to do it but

650
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,600
essentially you can say i'm looking for

651
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,000
this device or sorry this particular

652
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
ssid is it out there or it can say i'm

653
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,679
looking for any ssid and out and let me

654
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,880
know what's out there

655
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
so that's what i fell on i like i

656
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
started to focus in on probe requests

657
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
and i started scanning for pro requests

658
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,039
across all the channels right so again

659
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
on wi-fi you got multiple channels based

660
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
on uh you know the country

661
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,080
and then as i broke it down i looked at

662
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
hey i want to go ahead and pull that

663
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
source mac because again i'll talk a

664
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
little bit more on the next slide of the

665
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,600
frame the breakout of that frame header

666
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
and i just want the source mac because i

667
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,960
don't need any other information i just

668
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,520
want to identify uniquely identify

669
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,679
that device so i can prove that that

670
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,360
device has passed by my sensor

671
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,799
and then once i identify that i want to

672
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,640
go ahead and package it up and send the

673
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
probe source mac

674
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
and the sensor id to the gateway so

675
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
again the idea was for me to have

676
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,840
multiple sensors potentially to set

677
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,960
across different entrances of the

678
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
building so i want to uniquely identify

679
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
that particular sensor as well so i

680
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,360
wanted to send that sensor id with it

681
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,840
so here is the kind of

682
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,799
the

683
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,480
probe request breakout

684
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
so anytime you have

685
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
these management frames that come across

686
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,120
wi-fi

687
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
it has this particular format frame

688
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
control duration id address one two

689
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,039
three sequence control

690
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
address four and then some other stuff

691
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,919
qos um so on and so forth for this

692
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
particular for a probe request

693
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,440
it is a management frame of type four

694
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,799
and

695
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,120
what that means is adder one

696
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,559
is the destination address where it's

697
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,640
sending it to adder two is the source

698
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
address the the mac address of what's

699
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
sending it

700
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
adder three is the vss id that it's

701
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
looking for so again remember i told you

702
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,840
there are kind of two different types of

703
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
probe requests one it's look it's saying

704
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,840
hey i've seen this at this uh

705
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,600
this network before i want to connect to

706
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
it if i see it or it's going to leave

707
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
that blank and if it leaves it blank it

708
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
essentially slips it's a response from

709
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,000
the bs from the the access point to say

710
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,760
here's my my bssid

711
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,919
and then adder 4 is not used in this

712
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,280
particular pro request however it's

713
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
there for the other different types of

714
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
wi-fi frames so you'll see that used in

715
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,919
other places

716
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
moving on to the next piece right so

717
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
once i've found the information i want i

718
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
wanted to go and move it

719
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
to my destination

720
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,640
so for this what i did is i established

721
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,840
a point-to-point

722
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,440
lora connection between two lora radios

723
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,840
and essentially it was my sp-32 lora

724
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,720
sensor to an esp32 lower receiver or the

725
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
gateway i called it

726
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,559
and in my testing i was about to i was

727
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,720
able to get about 200 meters of distance

728
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,640
before it would fall off now just keep

729
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
in mind like i said i am not a radio

730
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,320
smee and i'm pretty sure that's i had

731
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,240
some some antennas were bad and of

732
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
course i was probably you know fighting

733
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,039
terrain so on and so forth about 200

734
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,640
meters which is fine because if you

735
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
think about the scenario i built

736
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,480
throw the sensor at the front of the

737
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,440
building

738
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
go sit out maybe sit on the parking lot

739
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,400
with my gateway and a laptop

740
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
or gateway in my phone and then i'm

741
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,760
receiving those lower packets and then

742
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
pushing them up to uh where i need to

743
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
aggregate them so then establish the

744
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,039
lower gateway and i pass the data from

745
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,960
the lower interface to then the wi-fi

746
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,039
interface on that particular device so

747
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,080
again

748
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,760
um hold these up a little bit so this is

749
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,600
my sensor that i can drop

750
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,480
and

751
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
same thing this is my sensor that then

752
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
just receives it and connects to wi-fi

753
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
and pushes the data up into the into my

754
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,520
uh my particular website

755
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,880
then finally the presentation piece so

756
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,039
again built a flask website um receive

757
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,840
that data in a json format process it

758
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,279
the biggest thing in this particular

759
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,720
piece is

760
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
i'm going to check to see if that id is

761
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
allowed so again if someone's able to

762
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,720
figure out the system sitting out there

763
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,400
they may not have that particular sensor

764
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,960
id so again it'll just be the website

765
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
will receive it will throw it out

766
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
uh check store the data in the database

767
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,039
and when it does that it's going to

768
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,679
conduct an oui look up so

769
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,039
essentially look for that kind of

770
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,720
company information

771
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,039
of the mac address and provide and add

772
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,039
that information to kind of the the

773
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
database entry and then finally present

774
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,559
the data

775
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,559
in a in a simple table format on the

776
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,559
website

777
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,279
all right so today

778
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,799
i've been carrying around my device

779
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,200
and just kind of looking for

780
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
those frames

781
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,279
and so here is my site

782
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,600
as it sits and so these are all of the

783
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,120
probe requests

784
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,880
that i've picked up so far

785
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,159
so someone's definitely spamming the

786
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,960
airways you see the top one there

787
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
i'm pretty sure that dead beef dead is

788
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,679
not a legit mac address

789
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,200
so someone's out there spamming it which

790
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
is great that's fine

791
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,360
but you see what i've done here so you

792
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
see the the mac address i put the

793
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,279
the time that it's last seen now again

794
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,720
that was kind of a guesstimate on my

795
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
part um because it's the time it hits

796
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,480
the gateway in assorted database

797
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
and then the count the number of probes

798
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,559
it's seen the actual lat long so again

799
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,720
that's set statically on the website

800
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,320
itself

801
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
the sensor id and then it doesn't like i

802
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
said it does an oui look up

803
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,679
and so

804
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,200
look all the way over there right a lot

805
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
of cisco makes sense right you look up

806
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,640
above you i'm pretty sure we've got some

807
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,000
cisco access points hanging around

808
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
somewhere a lot of cisco in this

809
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,960
building

810
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
so it makes sense that we have cisco

811
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,360
however that's not what i'm looking for

812
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
i'm looking for

813
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,720
those phones that are out there

814
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,039
potentially right so still more cisco

815
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,799
still more cisco some motorola so

816
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,840
there's a neat one

817
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,039
but again let's go all the way down to

818
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,440
the bottom

819
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,679
so once we come out of this demo we'll

820
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,600
start talking some lessons learned

821
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,520
and here's here's a it was a hard lesson

822
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,480
for me to learn here right so

823
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,480
i have one 11 180 unique entries in my

824
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,480
database

825
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
i'm fairly certain that there have not

826
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
been 11 000

827
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,880
devices

828
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,279
that have flowed through here since this

829
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,559
morning

830
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,840
fairly certain

831
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
so again

832
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,080
why could that be why am i seeing 11 000

833
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,279
unique ouis

834
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
what's that

835
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,919
possibly that's a good one so so the

836
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,159
answer was multiple radios but let's

837
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,520
think about it

838
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
they sold 500 tickets here even with

839
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
multiple radios

840
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
i would expect to see maybe maybe a

841
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
couple thousand

842
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
answers

843
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,919
reconnection of the same device but

844
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,760
think about it if it's connecting the

845
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,840
mac address should stay the same right

846
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,639
that source mag

847
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,880
what's that

848
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,159
so it's

849
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,919
so possibly but but again though that

850
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,760
mackel should still say

851
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
should still stay static in the back

852
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
there

853
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,440
boom thank you all the way the back i

854
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,679
got a i got a book up here for you

855
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,480
so if you didn't hear the answer

856
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,039
the answer was

857
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,760
me not dropping my microphone

858
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,120
thanks

859
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,720
all right so if you didn't hear the

860
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,919
answer the answer was

861
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,760
in

862
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,919
recent os updates

863
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,679
to windows

864
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,840
to mac os to android to ios

865
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,279
they have all

866
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,120
implemented a feature called randomized

867
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
mac addresses

868
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
for specifically for probe requests

869
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,399
and they've done that

870
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
and here's the kicker

871
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,559
they've done that to combat exactly what

872
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,720
to do here

873
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,960
to a t

874
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,000
so i think my gears

875
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,240
but yeah so randomized mac addresses

876
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,480
so if you go through this list

877
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,559
you will find and i've got a data set

878
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,120
from my house

879
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,320
that the oui will change

880
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
but the actual unique identifier for

881
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,399
that device will stay the same sometimes

882
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,919
so again a lot of a lot of analysis

883
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,760
there so

884
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
but what that does is it kind of

885
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,919
took the wind out of my sails if you

886
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,640
will

887
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,279
i'm like i had this fantastic idea i'm

888
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,440
crushing it i'm tinkering i'm making

889
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
things and i'm like

890
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,120
what are these things that i'm seeing

891
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,799
that i should not be seeing

892
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,080
and that's what i came up on my buddy

893
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,200
was like hey

894
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,159
you know because again i have a slack

895
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,039
channel with some friends and they're

896
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,799
like hey take a look at this boom throws

897
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,360
me a link and i'm like

898
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
yep that's my problem now so

899
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,439
it was a lo it was a lesson to learn

900
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,240
so let me go back here

901
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,799
get the presentation all right

902
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,919
and continue on so lessons learned

903
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,840
measured in oof levels

904
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,600
right oof cubed

905
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
or that or the oof

906
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,399
is the mac randomization for pro request

907
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,720
was built to combat exactly what i'm

908
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
trying to do here right so keep that in

909
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,200
mind

910
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,919
mac randomization just for pro requests

911
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,000
now again every os implements it

912
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,360
differently

913
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,640
and you might have seen that if you went

914
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,919
back and look at my data set there are

915
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,480
some that are that had no oui that was

916
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,760
identified

917
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,440
but it had a bunch of packets and then

918
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,399
all the way down to the bottom of the

919
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,559
list i had several thousand that are

920
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,799
just a single packet at a time

921
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,320
so again but again that that kind of

922
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,919
boils back to

923
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,480
the number or the way the os implements

924
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,120
that mac randomization

925
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
so another oof cubed

926
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,640
was please share and discuss your code i

927
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,440
understand wholeheartedly that that is

928
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,679
easier said than done

929
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,760
no one no one more than i understands

930
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,279
that when i create when i write code

931
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,360
it's a very personal thing

932
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,279
i don't want to share that with anybody

933
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,159
why

934
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,640
because it's an iterative process right

935
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
i've learned early on through many hard

936
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,159
lessons

937
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,960
that

938
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,159
i don't

939
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,480
delete any code until i'm finally ready

940
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
and even then it's an emotional event

941
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
i comment it out

942
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,360
or i put it in another file i stock it

943
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
away for later because you know what

944
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,720
there's a good chance i've messed up

945
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,039
somewhere i know i have i i don't write

946
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,279
code well

947
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,600
however the only way to get better at

948
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,679
writing code is to share it with someone

949
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,559
else

950
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,480
do that left seat right seat ride do

951
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,159
that over the shoulder programming the

952
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,440
the pair program whatever you want to

953
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
call it do that

954
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,519
because again if you don't you will run

955
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,840
into confirmation bias you will run into

956
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,880
the to the fact that hey

957
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,120
i wrote this code there's no way it is

958
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,399
bad

959
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,919
two lessons i learned here or two

960
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,080
specific examples

961
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,000
as i was going through

962
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,159
i was writing my website in flask i had

963
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,760
version control going

964
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,039
sweet

965
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,240
writing my urgent arduino sketches

966
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,399
i did not because you have to have all

967
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,679
your files in one location it was a

968
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,600
whole thing it seemed like a bridge too

969
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
far i hit the easy button i'll just have

970
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
it on my my desktop perfect

971
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,240
then i went and i was making some

972
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,000
changes this was when i was doing my

973
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
arduino to sorry my lord of laura

974
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
communications and so i had to set the

975
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,559
actual um frequency it was talking on

976
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,159
then i had to set the bandwidth the

977
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,120
frequency was like 915 e6 the bandwidth

978
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,519
is 250 e3

979
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,840
now if you write code in an editor it's

980
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,039
typically courier type

981
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,039
kerning right so standard kerning

982
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,120
everything lines up

983
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,799
on one i'm going i'm going or going

984
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,919
sweet

985
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,519
save

986
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,559
compile upload it works

987
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,799
same on the other one

988
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,519
save compile upload it works however

989
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,559
none of the counters were incrementing

990
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,320
like wait a second it was just working

991
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,440
yesterday

992
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
what is going on so then i'm start i

993
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
start stripping out code right at that

994
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,799
point i'm just mad

995
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,880
right i violate my own principle and i'm

996
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
just deleting code adding code deleting

997
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,919
code adding more code deleting more code

998
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,039
and what i found that i had done

999
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,480
and i would have found this faster it

1000
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
took me about a day and a half

1001
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,240
to figure this out

1002
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,480
i found out what i'd done is i set my

1003
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,919
frequency to 915

1004
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,840
i think e6

1005
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,159
and my bandwidth to 250 e6 on one

1006
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,480
and then 915 e3

1007
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,360
or e6 and the 250 e3 so the bandwidth

1008
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,600
wasn't matching up so one was talking

1009
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,799
the right way the other one was not

1010
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,559
listening the right way

1011
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,880
now again as that code lines up

1012
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
everything looked perfect

1013
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600
right it's very hard when staring at two

1014
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,679
different editors to see the six and a

1015
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,919
three and so again i'm i'm ripping code

1016
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,919
out i'm destroying it and finally when i

1017
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,679
when i came back the next day i sat down

1018
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,360
it was right there

1019
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,879
right now if i would have asked someone

1020
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,960
else to look at it for me at that moment

1021
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,079
they probably there's a good chance they

1022
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,839
probably would have found that

1023
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,520
you know it probably gave me a hard time

1024
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,119
about it too but hey that's the life we

1025
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,239
live

1026
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,560
so please that's one example of sharing

1027
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,159
your code

1028
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,599
to get some help the

1029
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,199
second example

1030
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
that i ran into

1031
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,320
so i mentioned in my design process that

1032
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,399
i was doing an oui look up right on my

1033
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
flask website fairly simple i had a

1034
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
large json file

1035
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,199
that i'd load up

1036
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,040
one time and then just do lookups on the

1037
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,399
fly

1038
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,159
and then as my sensor was sitting there

1039
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,918
talking and looking

1040
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,839
website was getting slower and slower to

1041
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,040
load and then all of a sudden i can you

1042
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,320
know went to bed one night woke up the

1043
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,639
next morning and i hit refresh

1044
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,480
three seconds i counted it three of

1045
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,918
mississippi's from a website to load i'm

1046
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
like man am i that bad

1047
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
at website design and i'm like well josh

1048
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
yes you are because you don't do web you

1049
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,839
do flask and so then i'm like am i that

1050
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,280
bad at python i'm like man it can't be

1051
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
that i can't be that i kept looking and

1052
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,480
it kept going i'm like there is

1053
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,720
something i am doing really wrong here

1054
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
could not find it

1055
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
so again called in my buddy's act i said

1056
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,440
hey hey please take a look at this

1057
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,079
it's loading it's taking forever to load

1058
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,160
it took him 30 seconds

1059
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,079
he looked at my code he's like

1060
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,240
yeah good job there buddy how about this

1061
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
little look up right here i'm like the

1062
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
look up's fine i mean i'm just doing an

1063
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
oui look up he's like correct

1064
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,359
that was fine when you had 10 packets

1065
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,000
you have 100 000 packets now

1066
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
and you're doing a json lookup

1067
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,640
every refresh of your website for every

1068
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,880
single packet i'm like

1069
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,800
oh yeah that's a that's a that's an oof

1070
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,520
cubed right there he nailed it so again

1071
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,960
what that having to do is go back and

1072
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,040
refactor add a new column in my database

1073
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,280
so i did one lookup the minute i saw the

1074
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,520
packet stored it with the oui problem

1075
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
solved

1076
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,320
so again hard lesson learned for it for

1077
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,359
that

1078
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,400
so here's an oof squared though

1079
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,119
take time to develop your design first

1080
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,240
right

1081
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
i know we talk about it i know if you've

1082
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,000
had any sort of design class or any sort

1083
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,359
of uh you know programming class or

1084
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
anything like that

1085
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,280
they've told you hey sit down and just

1086
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
maybe whiteboard your idea

1087
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,079
sit down with a piece of paper it

1088
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,839
doesn't have to be fancy and just do

1089
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,280
that however

1090
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,960
if you're like me

1091
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,359
you're like you know what design

1092
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,560
i'm going to jump in head first i've

1093
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
written code before i've set up a

1094
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
website this is too easy so you dive in

1095
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,160
head first sometimes you don't realize

1096
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,440
that's a shallow end and that's what i

1097
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,400
that's what i did here i mentioned it

1098
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
earlier in the talk right i jumped in

1099
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,359
i'm like i'm going to throw all my code

1100
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,079
on my editor at the same time

1101
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
because it all works separately so why

1102
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,480
not why should it work together boom

1103
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,839
ran into the huge issues right not even

1104
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,119
know where to start because again it

1105
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,560
started throwing errors

1106
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,640
and again compiled code is always funny

1107
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,960
because it'll find that first error and

1108
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,160
you don't know what follows you've got

1109
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,119
to fix that one and then it's an

1110
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,119
integrative process so again just just

1111
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,000
take time to develop your design first

1112
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,760
the other oof square that i have is use

1113
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,240
version control right

1114
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,680
i already mentioned about my arduino

1115
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,359
sketches ran into that the hard way it

1116
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,599
was it was rough going it was a

1117
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,119
it was a hard day in in the josh

1118
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,240
household that that time um

1119
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,880
because when i was done ripping out code

1120
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,640
and replacing code

1121
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,800
and then i switched that six into three

1122
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
i then realized i had a i had a

1123
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,160
follow-on problem

1124
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,520
i was

1125
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
i don't know how many

1126
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
deletions away from my original product

1127
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,400
that worked

1128
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,640
right we've all been there

1129
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,839
and if i would have been using version

1130
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,960
control it should have been you know a

1131
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,400
revert it should have been just a quick

1132
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,560
look up in my git repo of the submits or

1133
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
the commits i had and just to switch

1134
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
back to a known good version so again

1135
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,839
use version control if possible

1136
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,839
the final lesson learned is just a

1137
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,079
simple oof right but do not be

1138
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,160
intimidated by hardware

1139
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,079
i know it's a lot easier for me to stand

1140
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,960
up here and say that because i've

1141
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,160
tinkered with a lot um however it's a

1142
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
very mature space at this point if it

1143
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
was maybe 15 or 20 years ago and you're

1144
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,119
looking at an arduino and you have to

1145
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,200
write you know embedded c code just to

1146
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
get that thing to work

1147
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,359
it's a rough go however there's a lot of

1148
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,359
examples out there you know to start

1149
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,200
from with that are mature libraries

1150
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
mature examples good places for you to

1151
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,480
start and like i said i've got a couple

1152
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,640
in mind um that i've used to start from

1153
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,680
and then you go ahead and take that and

1154
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,960
you deviate from that path and keep

1155
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
going and again so don't be intimidated

1156
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,599
by hardware it's not that hard

1157
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,560
and again

1158
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,160
you can learn as you go right the

1159
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,359
biggest thing is just jumping in and

1160
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,480
figuring out

1161
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,320
what you need to learn

1162
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
by using those libraries

1163
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,599
all right so now like i said i failed

1164
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,040
but but again there's success and

1165
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,920
failure always right so again

1166
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,280
when i failed

1167
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
i've i now know that i

1168
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,800
so at the end of the day

1169
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,119
i know that this does not work and i

1170
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,280
validate it that doesn't work right

1171
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,359
so i consider that a success

1172
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,280
however i still want to continue on down

1173
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,200
this path so i think for my future work

1174
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
this is where i'm going

1175
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
so instead of focusing on pro requests

1176
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,520
i'm going to go and shift to see if i

1177
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,000
can do bluetooth sniffing

1178
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
i should be able to kind of transition

1179
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,119
that like just rip out that wi-fi

1180
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,720
sniffing code and replace it with

1181
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,280
bluetooth sniffing so again i

1182
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,560
you know make an assumption that it's

1183
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,240
going to be easy but we'll see but

1184
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,200
that's what i'm going to move towards

1185
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,240
for at least the sniffing part and

1186
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
identifying the unique devices i also

1187
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,320
want to refactor my code so i i

1188
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,960
wholeheartedly acknowledge that my code

1189
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
is not the best code at this point you

1190
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
know there's no comments it's hard to

1191
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,280
read

1192
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
you know a lot of the code has been

1193
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,079
commented out and there's different

1194
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,920
versions of the functions and whatnot in

1195
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,839
there

1196
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,480
so i need to go ahead and fix that

1197
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
also i mean you saw my website very

1198
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,640
simple just a table organized by a

1199
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,720
number of packets of scene so i want to

1200
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,240
apply some analytics to that right it's

1201
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
a flask website

1202
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
should be easy to build some additional

1203
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
routes and do some analysis there so

1204
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,320
that's where i'm going to go for that

1205
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
for that piece

1206
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,920
you also notice that i only capture the

1207
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
date of the last packet scene

1208
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,520
so i want to go and add some timeout

1209
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,480
logic

1210
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,400
right so if it sees it

1211
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,240
one time it doesn't see it again maybe

1212
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
it throws a flag on the website i don't

1213
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
know because again at the end of the day

1214
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,040
if you look at what i've i've completed

1215
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,319
i can only prove that someone has gone

1216
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,680
into the building i can never prove when

1217
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,960
they've left

1218
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
or if they're still in the building so

1219
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
i want to build out some uh some some

1220
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,079
logic there to kind of identify that or

1221
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,359
at least clue folks into like hey i

1222
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,280
haven't seen this particular packet

1223
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,560
you know in x amount of time there's a

1224
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,800
good chance they've left the building

1225
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,400
and then finally

1226
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,920
i want to refactor my design on a

1227
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
smaller board so right now like i said

1228
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,440
i've got the cadillac of esp32 it's got

1229
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,160
the oled display it's got you know the

1230
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,520
it's got everything on it um however

1231
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,960
i don't need that display it was nice

1232
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,000
for troubleshooting but now that i've

1233
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,280
gotten to the point where it seems to

1234
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,280
work i can go ahead and find a smaller

1235
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,200
board it doesn't have the oled display

1236
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,880
um i don't need gpio pins so i don't

1237
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,480
need that general purpose i o pins on

1238
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,319
there so again working myself to get

1239
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,319
down to a smaller board however

1240
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,920
the whole purpose of that is to get down

1241
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,359
to lower power consumption right i want

1242
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,520
that sensor to run on the least amount

1243
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,079
of battery power possible however so

1244
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,280
with the hell tech just to give you a

1245
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,440
little bit of an idea though

1246
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,880
that device has been running on three

1247
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
double a batteries since six o'clock

1248
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,560
this morning and it's still going

1249
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,079
so it's got already got pretty low

1250
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,000
battery consumption i haven't tested it

1251
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,359
fully yet

1252
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,560
but i want to continue to push the

1253
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,520
envelope on that because maybe it

1254
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
becomes a multi-day affair maybe i throw

1255
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,119
it and i leave it for a weekend or for a

1256
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,560
week and i want to come back to it so

1257
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
again that's kind of i want to i want to

1258
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,760
refactor the design to get to a lower

1259
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,839
power consumption on on the board itself

1260
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
so at this point i've released both of

1261
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,079
my gitla get lab repos out there in the

1262
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,359
wild

1263
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,280
that is my commitment to everyone here

1264
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,920
because again share your code it's i

1265
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,200
i'm seeing it right now you can go look

1266
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,359
at it um if you want to poke fun at me

1267
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,119
please i'm on twitter

1268
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,040
you please tell me how bad my code is

1269
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,720
but i've got two two repos there one is

1270
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
the webs the flask website with with

1271
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,560
directions on how to stand it up um and

1272
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,079
how to get it going the other ones is

1273
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,480
the actual lower code for the uh

1274
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,960
the esp32 boards both the sender and the

1275
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,440
receiver um kind of in both of those

1276
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,200
repos

1277
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,440
again my name is josh rorkowski reicho2

1278
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,760
and two on twitter um email there at the

1279
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,400
bottom uh ryko212 runcode.ninja feel

1280
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,920
free to hit me up let me know what you

1281
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
need what any questions you have but i

1282
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,640
just want to open up the floor to any

1283
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,079
questions about the research or anything

1284
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
i presented here today

1285
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,520
yes

1286
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,160
okay

1287
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,880
okay so just to recap so everyone if you

1288
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,160
didn't hear the question he's asking me

1289
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,400
if i was if i chose the esp32 board

1290
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,599
specifically for the lower

1291
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,119
communications on it

1292
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,720
or could i have gone another route with

1293
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,440
the esp8266s

1294
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,040
that and then use it in kind of a mesh

1295
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,319
network to get the same functionality so

1296
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,000
i started off with the idea of doing

1297
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,680
long-haul communications that was at two

1298
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
kilometers eight kilometers piece right

1299
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,839
i wanted to be able to possibly you know

1300
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,599
be very physically separated from the

1301
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,680
devices that's where i started um

1302
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
however you know again at the end of the

1303
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,880
day when you start applying that that

1304
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
middle piece that of that design slide

1305
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,400
that i had up you can put anything in

1306
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
there right i could have left it wi-fi

1307
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,480
and then been within 100 meters and then

1308
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
just push it over wi-fi to the device so

1309
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,000
a lot of different solutions there i

1310
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,280
just was trying to get that longer term

1311
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,640
never got there probably because my

1312
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,280
antenna tuning and whatnot um

1313
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,800
but that's how i ended up with the 32

1314
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,839
though that was a great question thank

1315
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,680
you

1316
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,160
any other questions

1317
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,839
oh yes

1318
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,400
any other questions i've got a brand new

1319
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,280
alpha card up here

1320
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
yes

1321
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,760
wow that is a fantastic question i

1322
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,599
appreciate that and sure

1323
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,520
boom

1324
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,440
what's going on man

1325
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,640
all right any other questions like i

1326
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,240
said about this anything i've talked

1327
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,200
about

1328
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,839
oh yes

1329
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,440
wow

1330
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,119
great question okay so the question was

1331
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,400
before right before i dive into this one

1332
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,720
the question was hey i he knows i love

1333
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,400
python and he knows i lean on that for

1334
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,319
flask but then he he threw me a

1335
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,520
curveball and said hey did you think

1336
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
about writing everything in c

1337
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,560
um

1338
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
the answer is no

1339
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
and let me tell you why

1340
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,200
right so again having programmed as long

1341
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,359
as i have in python i've been doing this

1342
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,960
since 2009

1343
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,760
i'm writing python code

1344
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,599
making that switch back to the arduino

1345
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,160
sketch and c plus plus format

1346
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,680
was

1347
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,960
a very

1348
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,040
emotional event for me

1349
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,800
right because i'm thinking okay you know

1350
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,839
i'm going to do i'm going to do some

1351
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,560
quick lookups on the mac address i just

1352
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,720
want to do the membership operator

1353
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,800
right in python that's easy i want to

1354
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
see if the letter a is in a string is a

1355
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,040
in

1356
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,440
stringvar

1357
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,040
anyone know how to do that in c because

1358
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,480
i don't

1359
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,160
right it's it's it's literally i'm going

1360
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,680
to iterate over all the characters wait

1361
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,359
i'm going to take the string bar push it

1362
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,520
into a buffer iterate over that buffer

1363
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,800
and when i find it i'm going to stop and

1364
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,960
say true if not it's going to get to the

1365
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
end the no the null terminator and say

1366
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,920
false

1367
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,680
and that just took my one line of python

1368
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,560
to

1369
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,640
well by the time i'm done with it

1370
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,000
right multiple versions it's going to be

1371
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,119
down here

1372
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,720
fantastic question yes if i'm if i'm

1373
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,560
looking for

1374
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,960
what's that

1375
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,279
yes

1376
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
correct exactly right but you know at

1377
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,200
this point um and i try to tell folks

1378
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,520
the same thing oftentimes and i'm guilty

1379
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,960
of it as well if all you have is a

1380
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,280
hammer all you see are nails i'm

1381
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,200
comfortable with python that's why i've

1382
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,400
gone in there and i've seen people do a

1383
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,520
lot of things but you're exactly right

1384
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,119
if i were to sit back you know write

1385
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,720
that and see i would definitely see a

1386
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
lot of optimizations and a lot of

1387
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,839
efficiencies

1388
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,760
once i got over the hump of hating my

1389
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
life for four months

1390
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,960
yes

1391
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,880
great question though thank you

1392
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,000
any other questions yes

1393
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,800
so the question was um some folks he's

1394
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,400
seen some folks use micropython and

1395
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,079
regular python and he asked me if i've

1396
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,240
looked in a micropython i so is

1397
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,640
micropython the um

1398
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,280
python that they use on embedded devices

1399
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,160
okay yeah so so that is a possibility

1400
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,920
um so

1401
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,760
i have i haven't looked at it before i

1402
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,280
mean i know it exists i know it's out

1403
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,400
there

1404
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,920
i'd have to go look because i'm making

1405
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,000
some assumptions here but because of the

1406
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,040
the the amount of um

1407
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
memory you have on those embedded

1408
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,400
devices it cannot load all of your

1409
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,319
battery's included modules of python in

1410
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,839
there so it might not bring everything

1411
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,520
with it um

1412
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,800
that is definitely a path that i can

1413
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
look at to see if micropython would

1414
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,000
carry a lighter

1415
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,440
uh lighter load and then allow me to

1416
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,559
write python code on my esp32

1417
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,880
um that's actually a good a good point

1418
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,400
only bringing

1419
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,640
okay

1420
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,559
yeah no and that makes sense right and

1421
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,760
just to just so everyone can hear and

1422
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,599
recap what he said um so what it sounds

1423
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,200
like is when you write your python code

1424
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,400
for this embedded device it compiles it

1425
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,319
down to the embedded device pulling the

1426
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,400
modules it needs only for that code to

1427
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,000
run in there so it makes a small

1428
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,599
footprint

1429
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,520
okay yeah definitely that's definitely a

1430
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,559
good path forward i'd have to take a

1431
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,599
look at that and make some of some

1432
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,280
things easier

1433
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,319
but yeah thank you for that that's

1434
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,400
adafruits library

1435
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,280
all the way in the back nick

1436
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,000
in terms of

1437
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,200
okay so the question was did i did i

1438
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,720
write any of my own custom modules or

1439
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,680
did i use existing code um for all of

1440
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,480
this

1441
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,240
it was existing code

1442
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,839
right just manipulated in certain ways

1443
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,599
understood what it was doing um

1444
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,880
commented out some stuff i didn't need

1445
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,720
so so for instance the wi-fi sniffer

1446
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,040
code that i found um it was actually

1447
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,280
pulling and printing all three of those

1448
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,240
those adders so if i go back here

1449
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,920
to the format

1450
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,599
it was printing address editor one two

1451
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,200
and three so again i didn't want the

1452
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,559
destination address

1453
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,400
i didn't want the bss id it was looking

1454
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,480
for so i just wanted that actual source

1455
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,079
address so i commented out address one

1456
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,680
and three in fact if you go look at my

1457
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,839
code it's literally listed as adder two

1458
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:12,880
in there and i've commented out the

1459
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,319
other two so i didn't actually um work i

1460
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,240
just worked with the code that i had

1461
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
so you kind of hit that easy button

1462
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,359
there to

1463
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,040
to get to the solution to this problem

1464
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,000
though it's a good question thank you

1465
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,559
anyone else

1466
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,200
that's it

1467
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,960
no more questions

1468
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,079
all right so i'll just close it out with

1469
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,359
thinking i thank you for your time i do

1470
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,040
appreciate it you know see some friendly

1471
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,400
faces out there i do appreciate it see

1472
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,680
some new faces out there so thank you

1473
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,119
for spending some time with these this

1474
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,960
afternoon um you've got my contact

1475

and you don't want to raise your hand

1477
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,119
here or if you have that epiphany you

1478

got on my on my page here um

1483
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,359
and i will definitely get an answer back

1484
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,960
to you may not be right away got a lot

1485
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,880
of stuff going on but i i i will get

1486
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,000
something back to you if you do have any

1487
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,280
