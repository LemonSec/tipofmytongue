1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,280
all right well thank you mark

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,280
that is the most unique intro i've had

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,119
yet that was that was fun i feel like

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,199
i'm on johnny carson or something

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,000
all right analyzing public breaches so

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
uh if you came today

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
hoping to hear

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,119
some inside dirt those of you who may

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,199
know where i work and have had the

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,920
pleasure of working i do occasionally

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,399
get some inside scoop on stuff that's

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
not what this is about

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,280
sorry to disappoint you will get one

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
probably factoid straightened out here

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
today hopefully but uh but that's

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
probably about it for uh inside

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,559
information on public breaches this is

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,199
actually the opposite uh this talk came

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,160
about

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,600
last november right solar winds dropped

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
mandiant you know was releasing all of

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
the the stuff on it

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
and and i see peers and teams talking

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
about a little bit but like a lot of it

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
was just

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
blowing right past

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
literally one of the most significant

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
breaches in

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
recent history in terms of implications

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
for us as an industry things we can

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
learn from it blind spots we can find

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
all sorts of tidbits in there and and a

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
lot of folks were missing it and that's

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
when i realized that um you know i've

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,759
made a

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
maybe a hobby but maybe arguably a

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
career out of studying public breaches

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
because think about what we do as an

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
industry right our job is to defend our

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
organizations i've really come to

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
believe that as a defender cyber

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,560
security is just a constant exercise in

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,360
prioritization what do i mean by that we

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,719
can't block all the things so our job is

45
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,240
to figure out what are the things that

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
we need to be blocking right now

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
and nothing against all of the amazing

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
stuff out there about you know we we see

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
we come to great conferences like this

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,560
by the way fantastic this year as usual

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
can everybody give it up for the

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,000
volunteers and organizers of

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
besides augusta

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
this is one of the most densely packed

55
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,080
in terms of valuable information all

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,040
year

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
and frankly is is one of my favorites to

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
attend

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,040
but but so we're getting great stuff at

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
this but a lot of this stuff is coming

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
out of research which we need and we

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
need to figure out all of this i just

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,239
saw a talk

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
last week for instance on

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,040
how do we poison

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,000
ml based malware detection right really

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
interesting

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,599
but mostly theoretically not something

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,480
most of the cyber criminals whereas

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
if it was a breach last week

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
that meant a real cyber criminal did

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
something

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,840
that means it's real data that we can

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
use to go oh

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,319
where would we stand up in this now as

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,760
you might imagine there is of course

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
some art to this so i'm not going to be

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
able to exhaustively cover this in an

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
hour but what i hope to do is really

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
stimulate you with some key ideas and

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,720
some maybe different ways of thinking

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
about this problem that'll help you

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
start breaking down because it's a free

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,879
source of intel that can literally help

85
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,680
you

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
just

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
have a really really strong cyber

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,360
security program wherever you're at

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
so we're going to talk a few things one

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,080
why why in the world is this worth doing

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
how

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
do you go about it

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
maybe some lessons learned the how i'll

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
talk a lot about kind of key questions

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
because i think that's the heart of it

96
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
uh and then some common mistakes and of

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
course uh hope you know we'll leave some

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,519
time for q a

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,640
so let's talk about the why and and

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
i i've even got a prize for this one

101
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
so what brave soul

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
some of you know i just spent six and a

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,159
half years at target

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,760
i had this little breach back in 2013

105
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
pretty widely publicized i doubt there's

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
many of you in here that don't know

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
about it right

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,759
what was the foothold

109
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,040
for

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
the target breach

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
in the back

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
hvac system

113
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,080
who in here agrees with that

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
who who says yep that's that's

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
what i've heard

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
nope it wasn't you still get the price

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,479
uh

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
i set you up there a little bit

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
i used that because

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,080
here's how that happened

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,320
i'll be back right back recording there

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
you go sir

123
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
absolutely

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
so um

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
so what happened with that

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
was news breaks target breach target's

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,080
got this huge brand you know target etc

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
right

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
so so everybody wants to know what

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,160
happened

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
and in the comments on brian krebs blog

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
uh

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
there was a a post you know about um

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,039
well there's an hvac vendor

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
that was breached and just disclosed

136
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,759
their breach who's also

137
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
a vendor for target

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
and over the course of a couple days

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
that went from a comment about

140
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,840
you know coincidental timing to becoming

141
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,759
the source of truth for that was the

142
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,840
foothold for target's breach so that's

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,800
the one

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,720
inside information that you'll learn

145
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
today that that was not indeed the

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,039
foothold but i illustrate that because

147
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,080
that's a great example of the why why

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,560
this is worth doing is first and

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
foremost most of the information that is

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
publicly disclosed is wrong

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
and it's wrong for a bunch of reasons

152
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
not all you know malicious or anything

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
like that it's just

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,240
companies are not incentivized

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
to be transparent about this again let's

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
let's take the target situation

157
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
the their entire board of directors was

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
under lawsuit all of the state adjourn

159
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,600
attorney generals uh the fcc launched

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
three different lawsuits

161
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
two of which came out of misinformation

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,880
that was dumped

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,120
potentially by some insiders etc right

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,080
and and so the unfortunate reality is

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
much as many organizations would love

166
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,520
to be completely transparent and

167
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,919
completely uh forthright about what

168
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,880
happened

169
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
they can't be

170
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
you know if your public company

171
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,520
uh and you put this information out then

172
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
what happens is you know the the

173
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
lawyers that are suing go oh well why

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
weren't you doing x y or z right and of

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
course we all know we can't do

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,639
everything

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
so not excusing anything that's not not

178
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,039
the intent here but this is a a real big

179
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,639
piece of why this is is uh difficult to

180
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
do

181
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,360
um

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
the other thing

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,919
is that you want to remember that these

184
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
organizations are trying to balance

185
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
speed and accuracy in the reporting

186
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,639
right

187
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
there's a cycle that goes on with this

188
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
right where the breach happens oh crap

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
we call in some sort of organization

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
often to help us do the investigation

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
bits and pieces start coming out in bits

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
and drabs because we never have complete

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
and and it all just ends up getting

194
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
confused in the

195
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
in the media

196
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,639
so let's

197
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,080
pivot though

198
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,319
so why is it worth doing well i already

199
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,319
gave you a hint on some of that like i

200
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
said i very much believe

201
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,360
that

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
our job is to have the right controls in

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,879
the right places at the right time

204
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
and so if that's indeed the case for us

205
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,039
right

206
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,280
um

207
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,840
knowing specifically what the real world

208
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
actors do

209
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
right versus what

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
you know nist whatever says we should do

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
and again that's not not a knock on nist

212
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
how many of you let me comment this from

213
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
another direction how many of you have

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
been in a in a meeting

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,839
where somebody said well

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,958
could

217
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,760
they

218
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,640
uh

219
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,839
cyber criminals potentially leverage

220
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
your security platform to ex-fill

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,959
critical data

222
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
none of you've heard that i see a few

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,080
hands right or some variation on that of

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
course they could

225
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,839
right our security tools are used

226
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,880
against us regularly by cyber criminals

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
again if you if you follow a lot of the

228
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
breaches

229
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,839
but

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
if you're a cyber criminal

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
why go to all of that trouble

232
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,519
when

233
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,839
you know i'm sure all of you seen recent

234
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,680
pieces where a lot of the ransomware

235
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
actors are offering

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,519
cuts on the ransom

237
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,760
in order for employee insiders to deploy

238
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
the ransomware internally for them

239
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
fishing is still

240
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
the predominant method right

241
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
if you're a criminal

242
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,839
uh the way i the analogy i like to use

243
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,519
for cyber criminals it's not that

244
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
they're tend to be that more

245
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
sophisticated or smarter than us

246
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,920
but they're more motivated than us in

247
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,640
most cases right we get in the job and

248
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
yeah we're passionate about our job and

249
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
etcetera but we collect a paycheck every

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,839
you know week or two weeks or whatever

251
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
the rhythm is whereas

252
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
the cyber criminals are kind of like 100

253
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
percent commissioned sales people

254
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
if they don't successfully steal they

255
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
don't get money

256
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
right and that adds this level of

257
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
motivation where they keep trying keep

258
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,160
trying but they don't care about the

259
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,279
sophistication or rarely i should say

260
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,240
right they just care about success and

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
so having those insights into what's

262
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,399
actually being used is incredibly

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,760
valuable

264
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,680
often there's really significant gems in

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
there

266
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
that we can find and i'll i'll give some

267
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,399
examples of that and my last reason that

268
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,360
i would suggest why this is worth doing

269
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
is because the threat actors are doing

270
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,399
it

271
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,880
if you don't think the cyber criminals

272
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
are looking at situations like

273
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
solarwinds and going hey

274
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,959
how did those folks stay under the radar

275
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
so long

276
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,959
what techniques did they use what can we

277
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,839
introduce into our

278
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,640
toolkit right

279
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
look at all the ransomware actors that

280
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
are just

281
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
copying each other in terms of their

282
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
their tactics

283
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
so

284
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,279
even if you don't think you're

285
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
necessarily going to learn something

286
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
valuable i would argue it's still worth

287
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,000
doing simply because of the fact that

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
there's so much in there

289
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,200
this is

290
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,160
wall street journal august 27th of this

291
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,839
year

292
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,880
this is not a good look for us folks

293
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
right

294
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,320
the the hacker that claims uh john bins

295
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,560
that claims um

296
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,079
to have be behind the t-mobile breach

297
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,240
did an exclusive interview he later did

298
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,760
a couple interviews with a couple other

299
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,720
orgs as well with wall street journal

300
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
and and that's their key quote

301
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,040
their security is awful

302
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,120
now i i don't know anything about

303
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
t-mobile's internal security but i

304
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
rather doubt it was actually awful

305
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,399
right they're a big company

306
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,720
there's no way they aren't investing

307
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
tons and tons of money

308
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,399
and and

309
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,959
we don't want to be this right not just

310
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
as an industry but of course as our

311
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
organizations

312
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
this is my kind of final graphic why

313
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,000
this matters to to make the investment

314
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,800
in time into analyzing these

315
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
so let's move into the how because the

316
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
this how is much more important than the

317
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,399
why

318
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,760
the how

319
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,639
uh i said earlier i think it's really

320
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,600
important to to start with realizing

321
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
that there's a cycle almost a variation

322
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,839
of is everybody familiar with uh

323
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,320
gartner's hype cycle curve right where

324
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
there's a new technology and everybody's

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
all excited about it and then there's

326
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
the trough of disillusionment where

327
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
everybody goes this doesn't do crap

328
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,040
and it's all just sales and then

329
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,639
everybody figures out how to use the

330
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
tech and it's somewhere in the middle

331
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,639
right that's almost how

332
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,519
breach investigations play out right oh

333
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,399
no the the sky has fallen they used

334
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,519
sixteen

335
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,120
0 days and now right and then

336
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
oh no this is no big deal and then

337
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
somewhere in there when it all starts to

338
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
finally come together we realize oh no

339
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
there's there's some interesting pieces

340
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
in there

341
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
so

342
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
while you're doing the analysis one of

343
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
the things you want to bear in mind is

344
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,399
how close are you to the origin point of

345
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,240
the breach notification because the

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,959
closer we are to that the less likely we

347
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,440
are to have useful data

348
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
it's only in the

349
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,680
collating that over time and starting to

350
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
analyze it that we start really getting

351
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,920
some some useful conclusions out of this

352
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,320
and so that's a piece and then i think

353
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
this is other reason why we often see so

354
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,839
many uh gaps showing up right because

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
we as human beings just wanna naturally

356
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
fill in gaps uh i was at a schmuck on

357
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,560
talk

358
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,199
oh maybe 2016

359
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
and i literally had to get up and get

360
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
out beca uh walk out because the speaker

361
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
who i'm not

362
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,959
intending to criticize at all

363
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,560
you know had somehow come to the

364
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,079
conclusion that uh that um

365
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,160
you know the malware was deployed at the

366
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
target breach

367
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,680
using microsoft's uh you know management

368
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
server right which

369
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,399
obviously was not the case or i know was

370
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,160
obviously not the case

371
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,680
but it's frustrating when as an industry

372
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
we propagate misinformation and and

373
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
don't go back and check and verify so

374
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,639
that's really what i i want to delve

375
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,920
into

376
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,079
so the the the heart here

377
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,920
is let's talk about key questions

378
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,639
that we should be asking first how did

379
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,760
they get in how did they get a foothold

380
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,160
well let's take some of the most recent

381
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
breaches as examples so we'll use

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
solarwinds

383
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,920
t-mobile and colonial pipeline

384
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
now i want to reiterate i am not going

385
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,000
to disclose any this all of this is

386
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
based upon publicly available

387
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,440
information

388
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,480
um so solar winds how did they gain a

389
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,839
foothold well

390
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,399
they you know uh breached the company

391
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,320
solarwinds company

392
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,959
managed overtime uh

393
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
hopefully all of you seen the timeline

394
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,720
for this so we're talking late

395
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,279
2019

396
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
all right and they didn't start

397
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,639
deploying the malware in their

398
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
production until march-ish 2020

399
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
uh going off the top of my head here

400
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
rather than the the full timeline

401
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
but this has all been publicly

402
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,279
shared and is is readily available

403
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,079
but more interesting to me because i'm

404
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,720
mostly concerned about the

405
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,279
end companies that were being targeted

406
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,720
by the actor behind solar winds right

407
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
the foothold there

408
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
if you looked carefully

409
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,519
they immediately pivoted off of the

410
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
malicious binary inside the solar winds

411
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
distribution to an entirely

412
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,800
separate piece of malware so we had two

413
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,839
pieces of malware being used

414
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,639
that was immediately interesting to me

415
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,600
right

416
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,639
and if my initial thought was hmm i

417
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,480
wonder if that's so they can evade

418
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,680
detection

419
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
not enough data to conclude that based

420
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,399
upon that little bit of tidbit

421
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
but i share that because that's how i

422
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,120
start to collate this uh as i'm looking

423
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
at these i go okay how did they gain a

424
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,320
foothold and as i'm

425
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,839
internalizing those details i'm asking

426
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,240
lots of sub questions of well what does

427
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
that mean

428
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,079
what does that imply what could be the

429
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,720
reason behind that

430
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,359
oops before i go on so so

431
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,240
uh colonial pipeline with colonial

432
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,839
pipeline

433
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,359
it was disclosed that they had a

434
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,240
single factor vpn

435
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,839
right in play that was used with some

436
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,159
compromised credentials um

437
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
t-mobile

438
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
t-mobile is even more interesting

439
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,440
because we've got

440
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
both

441
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
the organization reporting

442
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
and we've got an actor who claims to be

443
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,919
responsible john benz

444
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,679
who's giving

445
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
his version of what happened

446
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,760
so he claimed that he gained access in

447
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
the wall street journal article

448
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,960
through an unprotected router

449
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,080
which is

450
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
pretty ambiguous right uh in terms of of

451
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
details

452
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
when

453
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,440
the ceo

454
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
reported later he specifically said it

455
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
was through a test environment that was

456
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,280
exposed on the internet

457
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,360
now this is him

458
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,720
reporting

459
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
after

460
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,440
an investigative firm has helped them

461
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,000
with what's going on

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,960
later in the wall street journal article

463
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,640
with john bins

464
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,720
he did say something about production

465
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,679
test

466
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,520
environments

467
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
so i tend to think maybe

468
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,919
the the

469
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,559
you know the vagueness of the uh you

470
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
know unprotected router

471
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
maybe there was a dev environment that

472
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,039
was exposed uh to the internet and from

473
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,840
there

474
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,799
one of the other specific that comes up

475
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
is in is in the next question

476
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,840
how did they move around inside the

477
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
organization so before i pivot back off

478
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,679
at t-mobile

479
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,280
specifically

480
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
john bin's claim that he found

481
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
credentials

482
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
well if this was a dev environment

483
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,280
right

484
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
i i'm sure none of you have environments

485
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
uh where your your engineering teams

486
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
have hard-coded credentials

487
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,960
in the uh in the software right not not

488
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
a thing that happens

489
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,600
so dev environment might see see again

490
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,240
how i'm i'm trying to tease apart the

491
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,039
implications for what might be

492
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
the root uh issues of this and so john

493
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,600
bin says he was able to find credentials

494
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,679
after his initial foothold that

495
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,919
eventually he was able to leverage to

496
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,559
access an oracle database server that

497
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,520
had the customer in again

498
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,559
i don't know how factual any of this is

499
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
i want to be clear here

500
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,080
what i'm trying to

501
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,679
to tease through

502
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,240
is data that we've been given

503
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
and what might be the implications for

504
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
that okay

505
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,919
uh the ceo didn't say anything the

506
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,400
t-mobile ceo didn't say anything about

507
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
the lateral movement phase beyond just

508
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
access to a dev and from there was able

509
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,240
to pivot into production environments

510
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
not not in terms of a lot of details

511
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
there

512
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,000
what about the solar winds

513
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
entirely well

514
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
not maybe entirely new this has been

515
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,320
theorized for a while but certainly new

516
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,679
in terms of widely used the golden saml

517
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,880
ticket

518
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,320
if you've not

519
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,679
gone out and and dug into how the golden

520
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,400
saml attack works then that's your

521
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,480
homework for today first thing you

522
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
should be doing

523
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
especially because

524
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
in the the golden saml

525
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
attack that was used as part of the

526
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,760
overall solar winds with many of the

527
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,240
organizations not all and that's an

528
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
important distinction because

529
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
the how did they move around inside the

530
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,120
organization solarwinds becomes really

531
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
really interesting

532
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
because when you start

533
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,600
looking at the actual end organizations

534
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,280
that are targeted you find variations

535
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,039
the same things didn't work or weren't

536
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,000
used at least in every one of the breach

537
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,720
customers which then makes me wonder why

538
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,880
if the threat actor was using gold and

539
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
saml at most of the instances based upon

540
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
the public data

541
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,720
why weren't they using it on all of them

542
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,440
see how the teasing this apart is the

543
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,320
the heart or maybe the art of of doing

544
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
this okay

545
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,799
and then what about colonial pipeline

546
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
colonial pipeline

547
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,320
was undisclosed as to how the lateral

548
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,120
but there the interesting bit is is it

549
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,760
was disclosed that the initial foothold

550
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,320
was april 29th

551
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,200
and the ransomware

552
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
demand was may 7th

553
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,600
so eight nine days later

554
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
pretty fast

555
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,919
so whatever they were doing lateral

556
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,240
maybe if it was that single

557
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,320
factor vpn maybe they were able to

558
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,240
leverage those same credentials i don't

559
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
know

560
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
right again i we want to be careful here

561
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,720
we want to take the data that's given

562
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,799
and that was disclosed

563
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,960
to try and use that how is this going to

564
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
help and there is a how does this help

565
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
us coming i promise

566
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,679
another big one for me personally is

567
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,559
what tools and malware did they use

568
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,039
malware tends to be very personal to

569
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
cyber criminals

570
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
now i realize this maybe isn't as useful

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
for everybody here because

572
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,840
best value comes out of the tools in the

573
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
malware if you've got some reverse

574
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
engineering skills

575
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,760
but if you don't that's fine too

576
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
most of these for instance if you look

577
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,120
at the solarwinds and i'm give a uh uh

578
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,039
article uh or url sorry at the end with

579
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,960
lots and lots of data for you to go look

580
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,760
at

581
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,280
so you can practice some of this

582
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,120
that you know

583
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
takes apart the tools and really breaks

584
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
down what they did how they work all of

585
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
these sorts of things

586
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,039
and in the case of solarwinds the tools

587
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,919
and the malware i i don't think there's

588
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,080
a better word than elegant they were

589
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,679
just elegant the level of craft was so

590
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,799
obvious

591
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,559
in looking at you know

592
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,000
very small piece of code with very

593
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,760
strong evasion and capabilities um

594
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,400
and and so similarly you know what are

595
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,880
the tools in the the

596
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,279
malware

597
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,960
then i like to ask how long

598
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
were they in the organization before

599
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,080
they were detected

600
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,600
why do i care about how long

601
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
it's a pretty good indication of the

602
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,320
adversary right this at least the skill

603
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,760
level of the adversary involved

604
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,919
if they were a long time in there

605
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,039
undetected like the solarwinds adversary

606
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,039
that takes a high

607
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,520
at least unless they're

608
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
you know as long as the

609
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,880
victims aren't just mom and pop type you

610
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,039
know really small businesses if they're

611
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,080
going for enterprises of any size and

612
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,600
they were in there for a long time

613
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,880
undetected

614
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,400
that's a pretty

615
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
decent skill level required to

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,360
accomplish that

617
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
right

618
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,760
um

619
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,480
conversely how fast did they move

620
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,799
right did they get in and then very

621
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,679
quickly that can also be an indication

622
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,080
of high skills or it could simply be an

623
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,720
indication that they've got well-honed

624
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
well-polished

625
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
capabilities right

626
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
so in the case again

627
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
months to years you know some of the

628
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,679
victims for solar winds for over a year

629
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,679
uh colonial pipeline was about uh nine

630
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,960
days

631
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,120
and um

632
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,520
interestingly colonial didn't detect

633
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
them right the the ransomware

634
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,720
notification is what set that off

635
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
uh similarly t-mobile effectively did

636
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,159
not

637
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,960
uh detect the adversary until reports

638
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,320
went up about

639
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
customer data for sale on the on the

640
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,679
dark web but time frame wise for

641
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,320
t-mobile was about a month

642
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
from the

643
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,039
early indications to to when it all

644
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,360
became disclosed

645
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
and then similarly

646
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,840
how were they

647
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,799
detected right

648
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
uh i already i

649
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
i think the most interesting of these

650
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,840
three

651
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,559
is solar winds and if you caught uh

652
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,840
kevin mandia's testimony for congress

653
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,240
solarwinds was not caught with a

654
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,360
technical

655
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,240
thing

656
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
solarwinds was caught in mandiant's

657
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
environment because of a process

658
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,960
a manual process whereby

659
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,640
if any

660
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
employees added a second mobile device

661
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
to their duo

662
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
dual factor

663
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
a multi-factor

664
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
they manually called the employee to

665
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
verify that they had added a second

666
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
mobile device

667
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,559
so the the threat actors for solarwinds

668
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,880
were effectively caught because

669
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,679
you know they successfully added a

670
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
mobile device to the duo multi-factor

671
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,880
for an employee

672
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
the sock called the employee and the

673
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,840
employee said no

674
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,720
uh

675
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
she was actually out on maternity leave

676
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,840
at the time

677
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,039
uh and so had not added device that was

678
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,120
the initial clue

679
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,320
that led to all of the the what we

680
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,240
eventually disclosed

681
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
again

682
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,479
talk about a gem

683
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
probably pretty sophisticated actor

684
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
based upon the

685
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
elegance of the tooling

686
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,799
months in their most of their victim

687
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,279
environments undetected

688
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,279
and what finally outed them was a

689
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,480
process

690
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,600
hmm

691
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
i might should probably go double check

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
the the thoroughness of some of my

693
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,399
manual processes in my environment

694
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,960
but i'm getting ahead of myself

695
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,679
what was their objective

696
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,120
often this isn't obviously told

697
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,520
what's been disclosed so far for the

698
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,120
solar winds in public data is that they

699
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,399
are

700
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,080
data of interest to nation states

701
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
that's that's what we've been told

702
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,360
publicly so far

703
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,919
with the solar winds

704
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,919
with t-mobile obviously selling the data

705
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,919
but john bins in the wall street journal

706
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,159
article also mentioned that he was

707
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
looking for notoriety

708
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,200
he was looking for a little bit of fame

709
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,559
as part of that and oh by the way i also

710
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,320
wanted to sell the customer data and get

711
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
some money uh as a result of that

712
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
um in the case of course a colonial

713
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,679
pipeline ransomware right it they wanted

714
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,880
to ransom uh and and to get funds out of

715
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,640
it right

716
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,360
now again why do i

717
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
ask things like well what was their

718
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,159
objective because that's a useful tool

719
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,159
for well is this something that i even

720
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,520
need to care about then in my

721
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
organization

722
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,919
obviously we're all potentially subject

723
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,480
to ransomware but we're not all

724
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
potentially necessarily subject to

725
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,679
nation state adversaries which certainly

726
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,760
strong indications are

727
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,399
regardless of your personal views on on

728
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,000
the solar winds

729
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,720
as a possibility there and again this is

730
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,559
this is a useful thing for us to

731
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
consider

732
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,039
so i start iterating through all of

733
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
these questions

734
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,279
really with the intent of getting at

735
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,399
well what lessons can i learn from this

736
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,559
situation how can i take and learn from

737
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,440
i i'm still from the old school that

738
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,279
organizations that get breached are

739
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,399
victims not that i'm denying we have a

740
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,799
responsibility to protect our data but i

741
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,880
think sometimes it still gets lost that

742
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
these are victims right

743
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,240
one were there any systemic failures at

744
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,320
the affected organizations what in the

745
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,279
world do i mean by systemic failures

746
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,000
well i'll often ask questions like what

747
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,200
preventative technology was being used

748
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,080
was it working right in light of what i

749
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,559
know now if i understand the malware and

750
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,200
i understand the the tools one of the

751
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,399
things that you can do with virustotal

752
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,840
is run queries based upon dates so if

753
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,399
you've got the hash of the malware you

754
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,600
can go to virustotal and go hey what

755
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,440
technology detected those tools as of

756
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,520
the date it was in xyz organization

757
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,080
and you can get a pretty good idea of

758
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,640
whether the preventative tech should

759
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,679
have

760
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,720
you know uh helped with that or not

761
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,080
um or what didn't work right

762
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
and if if obviously there was a failure

763
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
if they had a breach their preventative

764
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,440
technology fail

765
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,799
well why did it fail how do we get at

766
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,440
why didn't they work and and often this

767
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,520
is again where having a big network

768
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,320
of of friends in the industry

769
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,360
i i feel like our industry is uh

770
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
you know i'm sure you're all familiar

771
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
with the six degrees of kevin bacon

772
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
right i feel like our industry we only

773
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
need like three degrees

774
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,200
to

775
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,519
to know somebody who knows somebody who

776
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,480
worked there or what have you uh is

777
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,120
feels like is often the case right and

778
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,919
and figuring out this why did it fail

779
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,919
now again we might have to theorize here

780
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,279
my q key ask is if you theorize nothing

781
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,760
wrong with theorizing just make sure you

782
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,159
label it that way that hey this is a

783
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,640
guess this is a theory just don't

784
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
propagate it to friends and peers as

785
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
facts right in in terms of of the why

786
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
did it fail right

787
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,679
often

788
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,039
um

789
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,240
when i'm able to to dig in and to get at

790
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
some of these uh route why did it fail

791
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,120
more often than not organizations have

792
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,720
in place the right technology

793
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,679
but they had broken processes or the

794
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,200
technology had fallen over and wasn't

795
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,120
reporting to the sim

796
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,000
like it was supposed to be

797
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,799
or not and you only get at those by

798
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,039
digging through these sorts of scenarios

799
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,120
to try and and surface these lessons uh

800
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,279
ultimately being i don't want to get

801
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,279
burned if i can learn from somebody

802
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
else's

803
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,159
then i i teased at this one earlier with

804
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,440
the golden samuel did any organizations

805
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
defend better

806
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
and if so why

807
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,279
well i was in a conversation with

808
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,279
microsoft

809
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,120
early this year

810
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,279
is actually microsoft's head of identity

811
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,799
access management

812
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,640
and of course they were front and center

813
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
for a lot of helping customers respond

814
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,320
to the solar winds and i asked him this

815
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,559
specific question say hey did

816
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,200
did any of the customers

817
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,240
defend better and and if so why

818
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,000
and he stated that the reason why uh the

819
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,519
yes

820
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,840
that several organizations

821
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
the threat actor wasn't able to leverage

822
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
the golden saml attack

823
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,399
because they were

824
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,760
storing their root ca

825
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,399
for the saml environment in hsms

826
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,960
and when the threat actor was not able

827
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,559
to access

828
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,399
those

829
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,240
because of them being protected in an

830
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,159
hsm hardware security module

831
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,159
that shut them down and they had to go

832
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,880
alternative routes aha

833
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
i better go make sure

834
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,320
all of our root

835
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,279
certificates are stored in our hsms and

836
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,200
protected appropriately

837
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,559
see where these gems start to pop if if

838
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,399
we ask the right questions uh from from

839
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,360
these sorts of situations

840
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,080
um and then ultimately of course what

841
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,640
should what i'm getting at here is what

842
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
should my org do

843
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,640
uh in order to

844
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,000
uh you know do in light of what is known

845
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,359
or you know another way to ask this is

846
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,239
what

847
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,079
would we have done

848
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,800
uh if we were in this situation

849
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,639
right what should we have done

850
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,520
differently and just start piecing

851
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,800
through those pieces

852
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,599
you will be surprised at some of the

853
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,800
really interesting conclusions that you

854
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,599
can find right and so much of this is

855
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,800
simple okay single factor vpn hey when

856
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,079
was the last time we validated that

857
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,079
absolutely every one of our

858
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,239
internet-facing

859
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,918
vpns has multi-factor enable and is only

860
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,079
accessible via multi-factor

861
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,199
when was the last time we validated we

862
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,399
have no dev environments connected

863
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,880
directly to the internet right we we

864
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,240
take and flip all of these tidbits and

865
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,079
we can leverage them

866
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,800
for we know threat actors are doing it

867
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,079
right now being successful right now

868
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,000
again other threat actors are going to

869
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,640
watch this success and leverage it

870
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,760
taking that and prioritizing those sorts

871
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,040
of things uh over maybe some of our more

872
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,880
theoretical type

873
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
you will often find broken processes

874
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,960
broken things um you know

875
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,760
think about the the

876
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,079
uh the solar winds hey if a threat actor

877
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,680
was able to

878
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,720
enroll a device in one of our team

879
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,000
members

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,839
uh

881
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,680
accounts do we have something that would

882
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,160
detect and validate that

883
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
right that we could use to to

884
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,200
realize that that that's what's going on

885
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,839
now of course there's a ton of common

886
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,920
mistakes uh i i've alluded to this one

887
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,119
already

888
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,520
propagating misinformation this one's

889
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,119
tricky i'm you know i i'm not trying to

890
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,520
uh well maybe even better way to say it

891
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,920
full transparency is there's no way i've

892
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,400
not also been guilty of this at points

893
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
in my career right it's maybe an

894
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
inevitable trap

895
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,480
but the more intentional we are about

896
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
trying to revalidate our information

897
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
trying to make sure that we're not

898
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,240
guilty of of that propagation of

899
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,520
misinformation reduces the likelihood

900
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,119
right

901
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,359
start with a lot of that early public

902
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,359
information

903
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,839
and

904
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,400
you know that's often the least

905
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,680
varnished and then compare that against

906
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,839
the later information

907
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,040
and the context is incredibly important

908
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
right think about when i was talking

909
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,640
about earlier how the t-mobile ceo

910
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,280
right knowing the context of he said

911
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,320
well

912
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
xyz company finished our investigation

913
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,000
and this is what we have learned right

914
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,599
so so

915
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,320
we know that he's got a lot more data we

916
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,040
know that it's further on so probably

917
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,440
higher confidence that we can have in

918
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,560
that

919
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,400
data and then how does that compare

920
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
against the earlier data

921
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,280
is a good way of of kind of trying to

922
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,280
dissect the other thing is often we get

923
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,960
hung up on

924
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,440
on important tidbits

925
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,960
you know the the the piece i uh you know

926
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,839
kind of uh set the poor gentleman up for

927
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,440
on the on the the target breach with the

928
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
hvac

929
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
entry point right

930
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,119
does that really matter

931
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,839
to to most of us you know maybe we do

932
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,040
have managed hvac maybe that's something

933
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,160
to look at

934
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,480
but a lot of those details that i think

935
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,520
we as engineering type personalities

936
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
often get hung up on often aren't aren't

937
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,200
necessarily relevant and and the better

938
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
i have gotten it not sweating some of

939
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,880
those particulars the the better i found

940
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,079
is the source information internal or

941
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,560
directly connected to the affected org

942
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
of course right

943
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
the context of who's sharing it is is

944
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,960
pretty relevant to the likely access now

945
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,760
the key here being that if it's

946
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,880
anonymous insiders be really careful

947
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,280
with that

948
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,760
often

949
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
people have a bone to pick with their

950
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,480
organization and will take advantage of

951
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,839
moments of crisis to spread

952
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,040
misinformation or

953
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,079
um

954
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,640
some of the misinformation i have seen

955
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
where i know is misinformation because

956
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,200
of inside information

957
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
maybe there was some notoriety that was

958
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,280
being sought and some embellishment

959
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,040
occurred right

960
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,119
so if the insider uh is directly

961
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,400
connected or they're somebody that is

962
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,079
sharing their identity sharing the

963
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,480
context and why they're sharing it that

964
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,520
often is very very credible source of

965
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,040
information for us

966
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,240
uh we just need to be leery of

967
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
say tips from

968
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,079
underground cyber criminals um

969
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,839
there's agendas right people have

970
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,560
agendas and so we need to factor that in

971
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,280
uh and like i said already just a simple

972
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,960
question of does it really even matter

973
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
on a particular piece

974
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,320
i think the other big mistake uh i see

975
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
most common is really simplification

976
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,240
errors

977
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,680
so much of this wants to be a quick

978
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,040
sound bite

979
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,800
and so you've got media who are very

980
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,119
talented intelligent people

981
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,359
but aren't cyber crime

982
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,040
experts right

983
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,880
they're trying to wrap their head around

984
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
it they're trying to portray it in a way

985
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,440
that their audience can consume so they

986
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,760
have to do some simplification

987
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,480
well if that simplified version becomes

988
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
the basis of truth

989
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,599
then then it it becomes problematic for

990
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,560
us

991
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,200
and of course flat out assumptions

992
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,240
right

993
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,599
we've got to be careful about

994
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,280
assumptions again you're going to have

995
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,040
to make some guesses

996
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,240
the key here is label them as guesses as

997
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,319
you're doing the work

998
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,839
what i tend to use for doing my analysis

999
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,319
is simply mind mapping software

1000
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,280
i'm just a huge fan of like mind node or

1001
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,640
some of these tools where i throw these

1002
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,440
pieces and parts right so i'll often

1003
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,400
start with those key questions that i i

1004
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
outline and i'll start throwing the data

1005
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,839
points up under them and kind of refine

1006
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,400
them and then start to interconnect them

1007
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,040
and it's in those thinking about those

1008
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,599
implications and those interconnections

1009
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,880
that i find really really interesting

1010
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,119
aha moments those kind of light bulb

1011
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,960
moments

1012
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,319
frequently

1013
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,599
so frequently that that

1014
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,720
you know

1015
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
i i'm doing a talk trying to encourage

1016
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,800
all of you to do this

1017
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
and with that i actually have a

1018
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,240
challenge for you

1019
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,200
uh so i'm gonna give my linkedin uh

1020
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,440
profile here at the end when we move to

1021
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,640
q a

1022
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,400
but wikipedia has done an amazing job of

1023
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,599
trying to collate the solar winds

1024
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,319
there are the solar winds is a little

1025
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,119
unusual in that there is so much

1026
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,280
information available that it's daunting

1027
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,240
uh it can be at least daunting what i

1028
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,280
would encourage is for you to try this

1029
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
out yourself because like every other

1030
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
skill in our field

1031
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,040
the skill really comes from the doing

1032
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,520
if you go to this wikipedia you will be

1033
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,720
slammed with a ton of information

1034
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,319
some of which is wrong

1035
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,880
wikipedia is an open source they do a

1036
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,359
great job but they're crowdsourcing the

1037
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,720
data right just like everybody what i

1038
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,680
would offer up as a challenge is

1039
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,200
spend some time

1040
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,599
reach out to me over linkedin

1041
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,839
and just say hey here are some of my

1042
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,400
conclusions and i will absolutely

1043
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,440
respond to you with right right wrong

1044
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
wrong right or whatever

1045
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,240
it's a good opportunity to practice

1046
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,119
where

1047
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,040
i may have some inside information i do

1048
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,160
which i cannot disclose for for lots of

1049
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,920
reasons but i can certainly uh uh you

1050
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,720
know help validate whether your

1051
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,040
conclusions are right or wrong that's

1052
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,000
how

1053
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,480
we as an industry in my opinion get

1054
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
better and better at this is you know

1055
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,079
coming together

1056
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,200
um and and helping each other figure

1057
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,240
this out because this is how i think we

1058
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,839
get really good

1059
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,200
risk

1060
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,680
based security right when we've got that

1061
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
deep understanding of our threat actors

1062
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
uh et cetera

1063
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,359
so there's my linkedin profile

1064
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,880
please feel free to reach out for

1065
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,839
connections etc

1066
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,640
questions

1067
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,160
somebody's got to have questions

1068
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,800
uh i'm not familiar with that one in

1069
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,359
particular

1070
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,560
okay

1071
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,359
okay

1072
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,359
the

1073
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,079
yeah so so the gist of the question was

1074
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,079
that there was a statement that an

1075
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,160
employee in the government had uploaded

1076
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,000
files that later were found to be

1077
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,200
associated with with um

1078
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,440
with the solar wind situation

1079
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,119
a few months prior

1080
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,040
i don't know anything about the veracity

1081
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,640
of that particular one so i can't speak

1082
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,400
to that but what i will say is if you

1083
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,640
look at the solarwinds detail there were

1084
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,280
actually several close

1085
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,240
close misses so to speak on detection

1086
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,240
where a few other organizations saw

1087
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,599
what later

1088
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599
was found to be solar winds but didn't

1089
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,200
realize the implications and kind of uh

1090
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,599
wrote it off as no big deal

1091
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
some even started investigations and

1092
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,200
then made conclusions because they just

1093
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,079
didn't have enough data

1094
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,760
certainly i wouldn't be surprised if it

1095
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,880
was something like that

1096
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
also you know uh

1097
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,599
virustotal internet of itself if you're

1098
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,720
not familiar with virustotal i i it's a

1099
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,560
phenomenal resource for us as

1100
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,680
professionals there's browser plugins

1101
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,160
that will automatically upload files you

1102
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,000
know so it could be simple things like

1103
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
that that one of these files ended up on

1104
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,800
a computer

1105
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,520
you know if you haven't seen uh

1106
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,480
mr melson's talks on how do you

1107
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
correlate all of these different malware

1108
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,119
samples and derive all sorts of things

1109
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,000
from prior b-sides you should absolutely

1110
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,800
that that's your evening project

1111
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,079
because you know doing doing analysis

1112
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,760
and correlating

1113
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,680
all of this malware what i will tell you

1114
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,800
is that's part of what i did when i was

1115
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,280
doing my investigation the tools and

1116
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,920
malware right doing cluster analysis on

1117
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,560
virustotal i again i realize not

1118
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,319
everybody has access to the virustotal

1119
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,520
back end is just incredibly powerful for

1120
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,880
helping you

1121
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
draw associations which can often lead

1122
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,839
to other questions

1123
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,839
in and of themselves right

1124
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,720
um other questions

1125
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,839
oh that's a great question uh i i

1126
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,599
consume from all sorts of sources um

1127
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,280
i hope everybody heard the question

1128
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,359
because of the the the microphone

1129
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,760
i tend to lean very much towards things

1130
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,440
like your bloomberg your wall street

1131
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,960
journal

1132
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,359
a really good non-biased one that i like

1133
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,280
is stratfor

1134
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,359
you know it's a four paid analysis

1135
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,200
service

1136
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,400
wired is definitely a great resource

1137
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
you know um

1138
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,359
yeah there's there's no shortage of but

1139
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,800
i'm fortunate enough to to have direct

1140
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,520
access to enough intel that i tend to

1141
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,400
hear through those sources prior to the

1142
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,560
others what i will say is those are

1143
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
great sources for

1144
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,440
cross-referencing right so you'll find

1145
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,000
all of the normal you know

1146
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,119
cnets you know so on and so forth will

1147
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,319
report on anything of consequence

1148
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,760
sometimes

1149
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,839
the most interesting

1150
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,079
things are the differences in their

1151
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,640
reporting a really useful thing is to go

1152
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,520
read

1153
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,839
all 10 of the articles

1154
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,200
or a few hundred in the case of of of

1155
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,240
the wikipedia article i pointed you to

1156
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,119
and you will start to notice differences

1157
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,520
and just be open and ask yourself the

1158
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,040
question why why are those differences

1159
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,119
in

1160
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,280
in that reporting

1161
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,079
could be no reason but

1162
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,319
why you know whether you're a

1163
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,119
two-year-old or an adult why is still

1164
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,920
the most powerful question out there

1165
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,160
sir

1166
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,640
ah yeah that's a great question how do i

1167
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,839
prioritize efforts

1168
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,760
certainly uh i start with things like

1169
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
uniqueness right

1170
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,640
um

1171
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,800
a lot of the reporting you'll get a

1172
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,920
pretty quick hit like the ransomware is

1173
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,200
it revol is it so on and so forth right

1174
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,520
if i have a lot of experience recently

1175
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,240
in looking at events for a particular

1176
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,800
threat actor or group of threat actors

1177
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,040
then i'll probably de-prioritize it

1178
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,160
right

1179
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,760
unless there's something notable in

1180
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,480
there

1181
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,880
i also use very much uh

1182
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,720
i think the best way to describe it is

1183
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,520
uh

1184
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,640
you know a drain methodology where i

1185
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,319
take a really quick

1186
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,319
pass on the out you know just high level

1187
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,720
pass through to see if anything sparks

1188
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,880
my interest and if it does then i'll

1189
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,960
then i'll throw it in the bin and you

1190
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,200
know this for me is a hobby not just a

1191
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,000
career and so you know saturday morning

1192
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,079
uh that might very well end up on my

1193
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,920
i'll take another pass through just a

1194
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,079
little bit deeper to see if there's

1195
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,400
anything of interest uh and of course

1196
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,480
this is where again networking is is a

1197
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,720
big deal too um

1198
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,160
you know is there anything that looks

1199
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,960
like it was novel or interesting or is

1200
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,880
there a big gap

1201
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,280
sometimes some of the things that i have

1202
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,760
end up finding the most interesting were

1203
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,880
because

1204
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,920
there was

1205
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,240
some sort of a big gap between wait a

1206
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,400
minute there was the foothold there was

1207
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,800
the results that

1208
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,440
there's a big hole in that

1209
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,680
which might be interested in going for

1210
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,559
other questions

1211
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,440
all right well thank you so much

1212
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,760
