14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
weird on the recording

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,040
if you didn't hear my spiel the first

16

that anything that would offend somebody

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
keep it professional but answer

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,039
truthfully okay

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
i'll give everybody a second to snip

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
that if they need it it'll also be on

the next couple slides moving forward

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,000
just in case any late comers come in

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
cool you got it so we're good so let's

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
go let's start this

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,878
so before i go into anything else

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,720
if you're doing this from your phone now

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
it should have changed to a question to

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
answer on your

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
mobile device as you guys respond i will

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
see them

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
cool there we go we got one dull who was

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
that

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,280
that's why i know awesome

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
important very true tedious

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
boring

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
hack the box somebody's giving a shout

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
out there

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
generic

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,439
these are all great answers guys

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,880
this is a lot of what i was expecting to

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
be honest too which is a little sad

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
i kind of said something about the state

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
of the way we handle training especially

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,479
stuff like annual training right and

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,799
today's new digital age where we have

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
all these cool technologies and tools at

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,960
our disposal it's still very

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,439
boring

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,880
all right we'll move on that's a good

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
enough set of answers

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
so why are we here why are you guys

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
coming to listen to me i'm forgiving my

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,159
presentation called hacking the brain

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
learning by playing

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,038
i decided to throw kind of that

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,878
traditional slide model out out the

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
window here i got really used to

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
building slides in the dod where they

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
were very dull you never used anything

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
but black font it all had to always be

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
the same but you know what we're going

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,160
to build something a little different

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,879
we're talking about playing after all

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,840
so who am i i am treycraft

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
you'll see my little gamer tag on

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
twitter you can find me on hack the box

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,120
i am a content developer developer for

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
hack the box academy sorry i'm making

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
you move a lot

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,400
besides that

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
i like to play i played a lot of our own

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
content on hack the box i am an educator

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
i am a husband and father a little bit

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,680
of a gym junkie and i love video games

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
especially

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
card games too so if anyone in here

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
plays magic

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,800
i love the new set yep got a couple guys

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,800
generic disclaimer you guys have all

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
seen this before right my thoughts are

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,879
my own what i say through these slides

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
do not represent the thoughts or

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
opinions of hack the box themself or any

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,040
of my previous employers they are of me

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
so problem you guys already hit it a

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
little bit right how we always handle

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
annual training currently it's dull it's

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
tedious it's very important this is

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
things we have to do

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
but no one likes doing it right in your

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
head when i said annual training in that

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
poll question you like internally

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,879
groaned

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,480
i could see some of you do it i heard a

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,599
couple

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,120
and that's typically what we see over on

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
the left right

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
don't click links from nigerian princes

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,920
like how many times have you heard that

101
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
and just having someone stand up here

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
like much like i'm doing right now and

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,599
just run their mouth at you for an hour

104
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
hour and a half two hours

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
and you might remember three to five

106
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
didn't engage you they used easy

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
monotone voice and just kind of talk

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
like

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,560
that doesn't do anything for you right

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
you're not entertained you're not

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,439
excited about the topic because the

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
speaker's very not excited about the

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,640
topic

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
but what's one thing we all get really

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
excited about

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
we love to play we like games like to

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,439
like have fun

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,959
why does our training have to be like it

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,799
is on the left when it could be what it

120
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
is on the right i'd say she's having a

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,798
way better time than those guys sitting

122
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,918
in that lecture pew right now

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,000
so this slide is pretty interesting

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
this is going to roll on for a second

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
did a survey looking through the

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
internet doing the whole google research

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
all that fun stuff right to find out

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
what some of the essential skills and

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
competencies were

130
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
deemed for a normal i.t cyber security

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,560
technician this isn't anybody that

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
specializes in anything you just work in

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,520
this field

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
this list is about 25 or so skills

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
that's pretty daunting right

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
that's a lot of stuff to master in a

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
lifetime

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
do you think you have a mastery over

139
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
this stuff

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
do you do this stuff every day in your

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
daily job

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,520
i'm curious to see how cancer so i have

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,039
a poll for this

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,160
you guys should have it too on your

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,639
devices

146
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
of those 25 or so skills that were on

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,160
the slide

148
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
how many would you say you use daily

149
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,639
how many of those would you say you're

150
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
competent in that you feel like you

151
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
could potentially do the job and you

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
could do it with minimal assistance and

153
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
minimal google

154
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
i'll give you a few seconds to

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
say again exactly

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
exactly that was the point there's too

157
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
many there to remember it all there's no

158
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
way you can do it

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
like somebody could work in this field

160
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
for a lifetime and they're not going to

161
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
master that list

162
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
and that's that was the i'm glad you

163
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
said that out loud because that was the

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
whole point of

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,600
give it another second

166
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
all right so we have 13 14.

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
awesome thanks for participating guys

168
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
this makes this a lot more fun for me

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
too because i'm not just going please

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
somebody do something

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,039
all right so

172
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
about half of you said one to three of

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
the skills you'll

174
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
half says four to eight

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
some of you are saying nine to more nine

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
or more you guys are awesome whoever

177
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
that is if you're doing that kind of

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
work and you're probably overworked to

179
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,479
be honest

180
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,280
you all need a break

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
so next one

182
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,680
how many would you consider yourself

183
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
competent see this is very telling now

184
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
isn't it we had a lot of people say four

185
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,759
to eight

186
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,479
they do daily but majority of those same

187
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
people said they might be competent at

188
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
half of that

189
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
how does that make you feel about the

190
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,800
state

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
of the way your job roles are right now

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
of the way the training you received to

193
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,199
be in a position

194
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
set you up

195
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,360
is that something you've ever actively

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
thought about before or realized about

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,400
yourself and the role you're actively

198
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,400
feeling

199
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,039
no you're good this is meant to be

200
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,039
interactive

201
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
oh yeah

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,039
it is definitely an issue that you can

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,560
do more self-teaching and

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
self-researching than you can actually

205
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,919
attending training sometimes and it's

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,199
scary

207
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
so let's move on

208
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,639
what's the solution i caught the audio

209
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,680
that time it didn't go through the

210
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,039
speakers though

211
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,880
who knows what this game is has anybody

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,199
seen this before

213
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
yep as mario teaches typing this came

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
out like late 80s early 90s

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
i loved this game as a kid this is my

216
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
first exposure to computers

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
and nothing made me want to play on one

218
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
more at that time of course a few years

219
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,919
later i found things like everquest and

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
quake and it was all downhill from there

221
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,560
but this was the start and this is a

222
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
perfect example of what i'm talking

223
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,919
about and getting back to that

224
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,919
grassroots learning as a kid you didn't

225
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
learn by listening to a teacher talk to

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,560
you all day

227
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
you learned by playing you just

228
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
experimented you had fun you weren't

229
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
afraid to fail but then slowly we

230
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,680
started growing up and we started caring

231
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,599
about our self-image and all these other

232
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,000
little social factors and now all of a

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,520
sudden it's a problem

234
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
this is where we should be

235
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,000
with gamified learning it can help us

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
improve the completion rates for

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,759
ourselves when we do start trainings

238
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,440
when we do other safe self-paced

239
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
learning you attend a sans conference

240
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
something like that

241
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
or if you just decide to sit through

242
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,759
another college class if you

243
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,080
go and self-teach yourself from a book

244
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
as long as you can make it fun if you

245
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,958
can make it a game or turn it around i

246
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,039
guarantee you'll do better you'll have a

247
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,120
higher completion rate you'll retain

248
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,240
more of that knowledge because you're

249
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
going to apply it to other senses as

250
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
well you did something you had fun you

251
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,480
had a strong emotional reaction all of

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,160
those things tie into your memory and

253
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
those triggers to help you recall that

254
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
information

255
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
so if you have to do something why not

256
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,319
have fun while you're doing it right

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,720
why a little more detail into this

258
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
this field itself is largely a hands-on

259
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,560
field right there might be a couple of

260
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
you in here that are in that higher

261
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
level management role where a lot of

262
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
your job relies around policies and

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
procedures and managing people and

264
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
hurting cats i guess you could say as

265
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,399
opposed to the actual hands-on in the

266
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,279
mooc doing incident response working in

267
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,200
a sock or something like that

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
but for the most part it's all hands-on

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
especially at the junior level and the

270
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,920
stuff that we're trying to teach in

271
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
academia today

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
so why would we deliver that training in

273
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
a hands-off manner it doesn't really

274
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,399
make sense to me and i would hope it

275
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
doesn't make sense to you

276
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,560
so 38 of us are gamers

277
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
according to the latest stats for 2021

278
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
on a poll in america and that age group

279
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
fell from 18 to 34.

280
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
the next leading age group was obviously

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
children to 18 and then it tapers off

282
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,120
from there

283
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,839
why was that anyone know

284
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
why would our current age group be the

285
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
highest amount of gamers right now in

286
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,120
america

287
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
we grew up with them we came up in the

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
80s and 90s that was our

289
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,760
past that was what made us us that's why

290
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,279
we're probably in this field as part of

291
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,640
it is you saw something you really like

292
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,920
dealing with computers and you just kind

293
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519
of fell in i know i did

294
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,720
with that kind of stuff and with that

295
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
knowledge in mind

296
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,200
on average people spend nine hours a

297
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
week playing video games

298
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
if that number sounds close to true to

299
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,880
you ask yourself

300
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
how long do you spend doing any kind of

301
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
annual training

302
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,079
how long do you spend refreshing some

303
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,920
knowledge or rules or policies you need

304
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,000
to know for your job

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
probably not nine hours right

306
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,839
that stuff's dull

307
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,440
it's boring you can find it when you

308
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
need it right that's always your answer

309
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,399
i'll find it when i need it i'll look it

310
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,800
up later

311
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,800
taking that very dull topic and turning

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
it into a game or turning it into even

313
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
just something interactive with like

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
pictures and sounds

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
and stuff that elicits emotion

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
will improve that engagement just from

317
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
your students from your

318
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
staff from whoever you happen to be

319
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,079
using that training for by up to 60

320
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,920
percent if you guys whoever in here if

321
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
you're a hard stats number person i have

322
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,680
the links to the polls and the research

323
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
for this

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
i can give it to you if you want it

325
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
but for the sake of this demo take me on

326
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
faith all right

327
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
and it helps increase productivity too

328
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,959
if you can increase productivity for

329
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,959
someone inside their workforce say on

330
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
how many alerts and stuff they triage a

331
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,120
day if you turn that into a game now

332
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
you're getting more productivity out of

333
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
your staff you're getting more stuff

334
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,240
checked out you're being more effective

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
as a company in what you're doing and

336
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
all you did was give a small challenge

337
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,640
so keep these things in mind as you

338
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
leave here today and as you go back out

339
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
into academia or into your job roles or

340
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,959
managerial roles whatever you're doing

341
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,720
you can have a little bit of fun at work

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
it doesn't have to be work

343
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
so another one this poll is there for

344
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
you this one's not really for me i'm

345
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,079
curious to see what you say

346
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,279
but i want to know how long you guys

347
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,320
think you spend playing a game

348
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,440
zero

349
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,880
we got some book worms in here huh

350
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
three hours that sounds closer to right

351
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
four

352
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,519
six there's our mmrpg players

353
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,440
so it's a lot of time

354
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,279
it happens to be

355
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,560
your prerogative for that one but i

356
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
understand it

357
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,839
that makes

358
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,480
sense

359
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
but overall these are good answers still

360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
these are all it's a lot of time and

361
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,760
that's what i was wanting to impress on

362
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,839
you guys is we sink a lot of time into

363
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
stuff that we love or that makes us feel

364
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
good and not a lot of time into the dull

365
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,880
and mundane

366
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
so how can this help us from a cognitive

367
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
sense

368
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
we're taking

369
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
huge huge skills and competencies right

370
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
each one of our fields if you think

371
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
about it in cyber security today is a

372
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
nation and of itself you can be a person

373
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,760
that all you do is traffic analysis all

374
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,320
you do is endpoint incident response or

375
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
all you happen to do is say deal with

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
virtualization build servers like that's

377
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,279
your job that's a niche and

378
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,279
i would like to say i know in my mind

379
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,440
i'm very kind of put myself down at

380
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
times but i don't think i'm a master at

381
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,720
any of those roles and i don't think

382
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
i'll ever get there because this role

383
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,959
evolves so quickly with what we do

384
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,279
taking that knowledge breaking it into

385
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
smaller chunks and turning it into

386
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,600
something that can be easily digestible

387
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
say in a half hour an hour or through

388
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
one session

389
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
can help with that recall can help from

390
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
that cognitive aspect and it will

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,120
provide growth because over time those

392
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,279
small chunks you broke stuff down into

393
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
will start to combine become bigger

394
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,120
chunks those bigger chunks become an

395
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,880
overall process

396
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,639
in your brain in your way you do your

397
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,399
tasks throughout your day and it makes

398
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,240
recall easier it now becomes muscle

399
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
memory it's not just

400
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
oh man how did i do x again and then you

401
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
go look through your one note you dig

402
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
through it all forever it slowly builds

403
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,920
and you get the recall and it helps

404
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
from an emotional standpoint i think one

405
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,199
of the biggest pieces this will help

406
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,560
with especially for those of you that

407
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
are dealing with children or high

408
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,600
schoolers at this time

409
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,240
is that fear of failure

410
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,000
everyone hates to fail everyone hates

411
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
looking stupid you don't it's like me

412
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
right now i hate that i said stand up

413
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
here in front of you and i stuttered two

414
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
slides ago that's eating me in the back

415
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,000
of my head is it a big deal no but

416
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
that's a failure in my eyes

417
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
and that problem elicits an emotional

418
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
reaction and i'm sure it will for many

419
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,079
other people

420
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
if we can take that failure by having

421
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
them consistently

422
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
do it do that task over and over again

423
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,079
and fail and fail and fail

424
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
eventually that becomes a challenge

425
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,519
right that's no longer something you

426
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,959
fear that's something you have to

427
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
conquer that's something you want to

428
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
conquer

429
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
for the gamers in here who's ever played

430
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
dark souls

431
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,079
what'd you spend most your time doing in

432
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,479
that game

433
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,120
dying and reloading right

434
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
what did that make you do with that game

435
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
yeah you put it down for a while

436
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
mostly you die reload play again die

437
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,040
reload play again then you rage quit

438
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
throw your controller and you come back

439
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,040
a few hours later or a day later and you

440
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
try the same exact level again and you

441
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,639
keep on going eventually you get past

442
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,560
that stuff that game's a great example

443
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
of this being a motivator

444
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
the next piece is that social aspect

445
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
by gamifying your learning and whatever

446
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
the lesson is you're trying to pass on

447
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,759
to people you're giving them a chance

448
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,519
to put on a new hat for a little while

449
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,680
they can explore a new identity and see

450
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,880
if they like it see if it's something

451
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
they want to do see if it's something

452
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,959
they have an actual interest in they

453
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,240
might need it for that lesson at the

454
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
time or might be a requirement but it

455
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,199
allows them to change their mindset it's

456
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
no longer me trey

457
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,000
taking a class about incident response i

458
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
am now the responder i'm a detective

459
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
doing some research i'm looking for

460
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
clues it's a whole different scenario

461
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
right like that sounds interesting

462
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,279
thinking about me just sitting in a

463
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,800
class sounds super boring like you guys

464
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
were turned off at the thought of that

465
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
but being a super spy that sounds really

466
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,839
cool

467
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,920
being a secret agent going to doing

468
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,759
research and talking to people that have

469
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,880
issues like all that stuff is

470
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,320
interesting and that's how people can

471
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,759
try on and play at for a little while

472
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
so the old hats in here will love this

473
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,680
one

474
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
i have the answer to your prayers i can

475
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,920
tell you how to fix this issue right now

476
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,639
can anyone tell me what that is

477
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,079
yep probably one of the most famous

478
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,360
things when it comes to cheat codes out

479
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,639
there right now right

480
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,839
i put that in there just for some

481
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,519
giggles thanks for participating and

482
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,160
helping me out

483
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,519
so

484
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,759
these are the four main ideas that i

485
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,120
like to address when we think about

486
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,880
gamifying learning so think about any

487
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
topic that suits you for your role and

488
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,839
what you're doing if you happen to be a

489
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
manager or someone that develops

490
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
training or works in academia

491
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,679
if you can apply these four main tenets

492
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,199
to that training

493
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
you will see a much larger uptick in the

494
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,599
way your students react to you the way

495
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,240
they recall that information

496
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,679
even the fact that them just loving to

497
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
come to class from that point on knowing

498
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
hey we're gonna play a game today we're

499
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,359
gonna do something cool not just sit

500
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
there and listen to the teacher talk

501
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
right what was everyone's favorite day

502
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,799
back in high school or middle school

503
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,600
when you go to class

504
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
skip day followed closely by jeopardy or

505
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,080
when you saw the tv cart roll out right

506
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
those were the cool days you were never

507
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
excited to listen to a teacher talk

508
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,600
but you loved playing while you're there

509
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
first one narrative

510
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
how does this look for you guys up there

511
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,840
good

512
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
cool

513
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
so i put this one up here as a good

514
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
example of applying a narrative to

515
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,679
something that could be considered

516
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,520
really dull or mundane this is a little

517
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
bit of a spoiler for a class that i'm

518
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
building currently

519
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
i give the student the scenario you're a

520
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,559
junior sysadmin

521
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,480
security

522
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
to work for that company

523
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
so

524
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,240
they think you have what it takes

525
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
they're going to issue you a challenge a

526
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
challenge is is you're going to finish

527
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
this module at the end of it there's a

528
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
skills assessment if you pass that

529
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,200
skills assessment you qualify to be on

530
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
their team

531
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
so now i took something that is generic

532
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,520
i.t and gave them a focus gave them a

533
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
challenge

534
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,480
there's something different to do that

535
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
narrative will entice people to continue

536
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,440
on and playing or it'll hook them in all

537
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
of a sudden now they're invested in the

538
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
process in the scenario it's not just

539
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
because it's good for them or they have

540
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
to know it for their job they want to

541
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
know how the story plays out

542
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,440
they want to see what the skills

543
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,120
assessment are that kind of a thing

544
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
challenges

545
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
quest chains to break up big ideas we

546
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,640
talked about how our memory is and how

547
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
we retain information and you can only

548
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
take so many chunks in at a time if any

549
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,919
of you have worked in psychology or

550
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
anything like that before you get the

551
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
basis of chunking theory and short-term

552
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
memory

553
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,000
you can only take so much before your

554
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
brain just lets it slide in one ear and

555
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,960
out the other

556
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,200
by taking those big level topics like

557
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,720
let's say

558
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,799
traffic analysis and breaking it into

559
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,240
different pieces like okay let's talk

560
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
about tcpip let's talk about the

561
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,960
individual levels in the model now we're

562
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,559
taking this really big topic and we're

563
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,360
making it into a smaller quest

564
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
each one of those quests will build upon

565
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,640
each other and eventually you complete

566
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,360
that chain or those challenges

567
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
what we're doing here is you're giving

568
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,559
them something that's small easily

569
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
digestible you're defining a rule set of

570
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
what they have to do what the

571
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
requirements are to beat that challenge

572
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,840
and in the end you're giving them a

573
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,440
reward

574
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
i built out this little quest window

575
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,000
here anybody recognize that

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,919
i'm sure it's world of warcraft right

577
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,720
that was pretty fun to make but gave a

578
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,559
little scenario here can you decrypt

579
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
this message it washed up on the shore

580
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
but it just looks like gibberish to me i

581
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,520
don't know what it says can you help me

582
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
out what's the objective of the quest

583
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,000
decode this message for traycraft and

584
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,919
let's see where this clue leads what's

585
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,120
the reward

586
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,600
knowledge you might learn something

587
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,520
i might get a new quest the chain might

588
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
continue or it might be the end and

589
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
it'll give you the big answer you've

590
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,440
been looking for the entire time

591
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,760
[Music]

592
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,159
yes it played that time

593
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
so progress mechanics this is a big one

594
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,919
i think this is a factor in a lot of our

595
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,919
lives is we're very competitive by

596
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,039
nature

597
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
if you can give your students or even

598
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,679
yourself some form or mechanism to level

599
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
up to gain experience through class or

600
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
prestige

601
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
it'll increase your engagement it'll

602
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
ensure that they're there they're on

603
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,600
task yes sir and they're ready to go

604
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
things like badges and flare obviously

605
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
i'm saying i work for hack the box i

606
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,000
gave you a couple examples from our site

607
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,440
badges are something they're very very

608
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
simple right oftentimes meaningless they

609
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
mean you you hit a hurdle or an

610
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
accomplishment you did a thing or you

611
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
talk to a person stuff like that people

612
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,720
love badges though

613
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
like that's your thing if anyone here

614
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,679
like plays candy crush like you you

615
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,600
cracked a million purple candies and you

616
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
get a new badge like that stuff makes

617
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
people happy it makes you cool you get a

618
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
little neurochemical reaction happen in

619
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
your head and you love it and you

620
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,240
remember it and you want to do it again

621
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
the same thing applies to stuff like

622
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
rankings or flair

623
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
it's really cool and you can see it and

624
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,640
how people go crazy in the hack the box

625
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
discord when they go from like noob to

626
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
script kitty or script kitty to hacker

627
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
people love that stuff

628
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
and that's just intrinsic to our nature

629
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
if you can rank up if you can show

630
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,360
progress and be able to show your

631
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
friends progress

632
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,120
it'll go a long way

633
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,520
you can take that whole fear of things

634
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,919
like grades and taking tests and you can

635
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,159
turn it

636
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,080
who okay who in here is in college right

637
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,760
now apparently

638
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
how many of your professors grade your

639
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
test the day you turn them in

640
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,120
none right how about a week later

641
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,240
usually like the night before right

642
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,440
is that scary to you

643
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
or are you all right with that that's

644
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
fine

645
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
no right he's like no that's not cool

646
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
it's not okay because now you sit and

647
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,480
you prep for weeks going okay did i pass

648
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
that test did i get that knowledge do i

649
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,679
know what's going on

650
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,720
or

651
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
did i fail

652
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,440
by

653
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,559
sprinkling

654
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,120
grades or giving them experience points

655
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,559
in between you're giving immediate

656
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
feedback you're helping keep the cycle

657
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
along you're helping them progress

658
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,320
because they're going cool i passed

659
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
awesome next skill i learned it move on

660
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
or crap i failed

661
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,640
try that again do it again

662
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
and it helps with retention it helps

663
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,919
bring it all together

664
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,080
people like that instant feedback

665
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
so keep this in mind as you start

666
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
building out new training or as you try

667
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,039
to implement some kind of program with

668
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,679
your students

669
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
and collaboration

670
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
this one i feel is a really big deal and

671
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
this is a life skill most people don't

672
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,880
get which is kind of weird to say

673
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
encouraging teamwork focusing on puzzles

674
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,280
and challenges and stuff that require

675
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
your students or whoever's taking that

676
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,679
training or that learning progress to

677
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,440
work together

678
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,039
can go a long way

679
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,159
most people

680
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,159
don't like talking to other people you

681
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,840
don't like asking for help you don't

682
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
like saying you don't know

683
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
but if you make them have to you

684
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
normalize it it's no longer a fear it's

685
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
no longer an issue they realize it's

686
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
okay

687
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,240
it's okay not to know everything it's

688
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
okay to ask for help so as long as you

689
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
build in mechanisms that one allow them

690
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,480
that outlet to ask you or a neighbor for

691
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
help or to collaborate and join a group

692
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,200
for the raid do that kind of stuff

693
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
yeah see got a smile there too

694
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,679
it makes it easier you're not as afraid

695
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
you're ready to go you want to do it now

696
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
you're not just hiding in the back

697
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,158
hoping no one notices you

698
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
so that's kind of where i'm trying to

699
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,279
get with this i wanted to normalize

700
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,840
those issues and bring them

701
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
to the forefront and make them okay it's

702
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,799
not a problem any longer

703
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
disclaimer for gamified learning

704
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
for all its pluses and all the great

705
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
things that i think it entails and i

706
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,400
feel about it it does have problems so

707
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,559
it's not a one-shot solution

708
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,400
it's very tedious and time-consuming to

709
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
build out these kind of stuffs that

710
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
little quest window i made a couple

711
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
slides earlier that took me about five

712
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
hours to put that together i had to

713
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,240
source the exact fonts find the quest

714
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,159
little bubble window go through and

715
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
actually make the base64 encoded text

716
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,480
and do all these other kind of things

717
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,840
but i feel like it was worthwhile just

718
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,279
to see the reactions i got out of some

719
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,159
of you when i put that up there

720
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,679
not every student's going to react that

721
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,360
way though some students really don't

722
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,039
like being put on the spot some may not

723
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,400
like narrative they might be the

724
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,159
competitive type or all they do is they

725
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,840
play pvp all day they don't even look at

726
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,679
the scenario of their games and stuff

727
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,360
like that so that kind of stuff might

728
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,559
not hook them

729
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,000
the key is to find that balance and

730
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,360
understand your audience and who you're

731
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,120
talking to and dealing with because then

732
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
you can almost tailor make it to each

733
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,440
person use the same general scenario but

734
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
you put little sprinkles of that

735
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,120
influence throughout so that it keeps

736
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,039
them coming and keeps them progressing

737
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,279
this i'm putting out here for you guys

738
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,400
am i close

739
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,279
close to time five okay

740
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
some resources to help you level up if

741
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,720
you're looking for a general skills

742
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,919
progression for all the individual

743
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,440
learners out here the self-taught people

744
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,799
like we have up here

745
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,400

751
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,480
how many of you have ever attacked

752
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
splunk before

753
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,559
invaluable like resource it is a gold

759
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,000
mine for stuff out there if you want to

760
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,039
know

761
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
and i'm sure you can think of three four

762
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,480
five other names or places you can go to

763
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,919
find general skills training right

764
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,559
ctfs if you've never played holiday hack

765
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,760
challenge

766
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,039
go home tonight and play it you've got

767
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,600
homework it's a game you'll have fun

768
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,679
that's where the picture comes from here

769
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,039
holiday hack challenge is probably my

770
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,640
favorite thing to play come holiday

771
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
season it's literally a game that takes

772
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
cyber and makes it a game in that

773
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
previous image i was an elf in santa's

774
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
castle in the north pole trying to hack

775
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,799
an arcade shelf so i'm literally playing

776
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,120
a game trying to hack a game like what's

777
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,559
cooler than that when it comes to i.t

778
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,200
and cyber there's not much

779
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
for pico ctf if you've never played a

780
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
ctf before and you're it's still afraid

781
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,799
or a scary thing for you

782
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,640
they will literally teach you how to ctf

783
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
that's what their entire website is

784
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
dedicated to

785
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
and it's a cool little resource

786
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,840
what about learning programming

787
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
languages i'll say for me this is a

788
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
personal problem that i have was it's

789
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,760
always been a daunting and scary thing

790
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,159
these three resources here

791
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:58,880
oh

792
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,559
wire

793
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,559
if you don't know bash it is a fun way

794
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,480
to learn bash with under the wire it's

795
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,320
the same thing but for powershell

796
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,760
they've turned

797
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,520
these programming languages and they've

798
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
made them into a game into challenge

799
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,039
into puzzles and there's plenty of

800
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,360
different levels as you solve one level

801
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
the

802
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
password or the phrase or whatever

803
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
happens to be the flag that you found is

804
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,120
the password to let you into the next

805
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,760
level so it's a progression game and

806
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,000
it's really fun it made powershell and

807
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,399
bash not as daunting this third one down

808
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
here the little computer screen

809
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
that's from a website called python

810
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,120
challenge

811
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
it's basically just based on your url

812
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,039
and it allows you to experiment and play

813
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
with python and the challenges they give

814
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,360
you are to affect the web

815
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
this example they give you a hint where

816
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
they're saying try messing with the url

817
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
in the address block if you can change

818
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,520
it

819
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,159
you'll progress to the next level

820
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,200
and then they give you little hints

821
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,240
obviously through the pictures

822
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,279
did anybody decode that

823
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,480
it's right here in the text box too if

824
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,159
anyone wants to give it a try

825
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,720
no man

826
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,159
i'll leave it up for a second or two if

827
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,320
somebody wants to give it a try

828
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,678
i'll take questions while we're going

829
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,600
first one answer that i've got a cool

830
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,399
little

831
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,039
gift for you

832
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,880
all right cool whoever that was who's

833
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
that first one hand

834
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,120
come see me after this all right

835
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,240
figured at least somebody would give it

836
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,279
a try

837
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,200
what questions do you guys have for me

838
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
i got a few minutes left right

839
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,120
cool perfect timing

840
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
i did this in an hour and 15 minutes two

841
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,480
nights ago

842
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,000
so i'm kind of proud of myself for

843
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,600
bringing that down to a half hour

844
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,440
any questions comments concerns

845
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,000
sorry can you speak up please

846
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,960
oh yeah there you go that works too

847
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,679
i would solve that issue by finding the

848
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,760
balance not everyone likes games some of

849
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,960
you might prefer a board game or you

850
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
might just like to read and that's your

851
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
thing that's where in traditional

852
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
learning you take that lecture model say

853
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,520
today

854
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,039
we do a lecture we do a talk about a

855
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
specific skill tomorrow we play a

856
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
challenge that lets you practice the

857
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,200
skill that would be my recommendation on

858
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,080
how to solve that problem

859
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,039
yes sir

860
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,360
the answer to that question is i don't

861
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
know your employer so i couldn't tell

862
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,159
you

863
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,840
but what i would say is they probably

864
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,240
have a training program in place already

865
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,000
get involved if that's something you

866
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,679
feel strongly about help them that's

867
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
something you can change on your own

868
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
a lot of this stuff is pretty easy with

869
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
stuff like ctfd you can stand a ctf up

870
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
in hours

871
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,399
add some questions add some answers and

872
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600
you're good

873
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
so if it's something that you have

874
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,120
interest in that would be the easiest

875
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
way is to just be involved in that

876
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,879
training team

877
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,360
yes probably last one right here

878
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,000
same with if you like learning new

879
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,480
languages duolingo is a perfect example

880
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,159
by learning

881
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,679
all right well that was my talk guys
