1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,559
as ken can he mention for that

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,239
introduction um we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,240
these things um we're gonna talk about a

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,279
caveat

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
uh why this talk security or baby is

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
ugly um social engineer team and then

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,519
the number one security activity and

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,840
resources if we have time we'll get

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,800
um lunch you guys don't want to go to

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
lunch you guys don't want to stand that

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,719
line right i can get an extra 15 minutes

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,520
um all right the caveat right

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
engineer uh developers to its

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
support

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,920
it's very much difficult you get to a

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,120
certain point so you kind of have to

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,840
realize that these techniques uh will

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,199
get you in with the dev team we'll get

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
them thinking more about security but

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
you have to have leadership support and

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
that's what i've always had is buy in

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
from the management luckily a lot of dev

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,440
managers at least the good ones want

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
quality code right and in my view secure

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,119
code is quality code it's already in the

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
documentation on how to do stuff

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,119
properly they're not doing anything

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,960
really all that special other than

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,840
um you know writing good code and

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,720
you know

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
development managers and leadership want

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
that so especially if you show that uh

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,119
that will help um and that so that also

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,720
might require your leadership to

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,159
actually social engineer depending on

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
what level you're at right getting in

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
with the development team

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
and the development leadership am i

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
clicker is not working

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
um so why this talk um i think there's

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
this is a problem i talk to a lot of

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
people within the industry is how do i

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
get developers thinking about security

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
you know in a much better way i have

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
successfully been able to do that

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
started premise health in 2016 as the

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
software security engineer uh and what

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
was cool about the role was that i sat

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
with the development team the security

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,840
and the development team were in two

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
different buildings i sat with the

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
developers and so i really got ingrained

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,079
with them

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
um but you know and i've always kind of

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,360
gotten along with people pretty well

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
just naturally but then i read chris had

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
naggy's social engineering books and i

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
was like holy crap a lot of this stuff

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,120
is applicable not just to breaking into

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
buildings but just interacting with your

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
fellow person right

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
so that's why this talk but before we

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
get to the social engineering aspects i

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
do have a bit of a rant on the security

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,080
industry as a whole and kind of some of

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
the things that i see as kind of

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
off-putting when you're working with

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,599
development teams

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,160
the first thing is we're not special

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,800
we are glorified hall monitors that's

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
all you can't run you can't run in the

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,280
halls you can't do that right and so we

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
kind of have to be a little bit humble

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
when we approach development and really

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
anybody that's outside of security we

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,560
can kind of get you know pumped up oh i

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,000
own this i hacked this you know but

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
we're really just telling that they you

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:52,959
know

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
did something um you know wrong and

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
that's what a moniker is

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
so we're not really

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,720
you know also if your office the office

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
fan the assistant to the regional

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
manager uh instead of the assistant

86
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,159
regional manager so

87
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,959
um

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,720
one of my first things that i get on is

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
the security champions the concept is

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,920
good

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,680
i think the execution of it is

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
great i don't i've ever talked to a

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
developer

94
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,640
champion and asked them what they did i

95
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
have they say it's very corporate so if

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
you're going to start throwing that term

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,239
around that can kind of be off-putting

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,840
you're pretty much putting hall monitor

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
sash onto someone that actually wants to

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,120
do a good job from a security

101
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
perspective and again this might work if

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
it works at your place and it's great

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
you know absolutely go for it but it

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
could be something different right it

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,959
could be like jedi guru something that a

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,239
lot of developers are going to kind of

107
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,040
speak to or you know in my view they're

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
just a good developer again quality code

109
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
is secure code so if they're writing

110
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
quality code they're a good developer

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,319
and they're already doing the security

112
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
things as they're writing the code um so

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
it's again we throw this around a whole

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
lot and i actually had a sales person

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
come up to me and say i didn't even

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,879
realize i was doing that and it might be

117
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
off-putting to the developers so before

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
throwing certain terms around and the

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,799
next one is of particular concern

120
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
sec devops

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
dev secops

122
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
devops sec i mean if we can't even get

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,040
the name right

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,520
why are we even you know using this term

125
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
right um and i love uh to me it's just

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
devops right it's it's nothing special

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,919
again we are nothing special all right

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,840
we don't need to come in and insert our

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
stuff into their names and

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
by the way i've talked to developers who

131
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
think devops is a stupid term just in

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
general right they actually wanted to be

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
called not the devops team but the

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
platform engineering team so they even

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,280
hate some of these buzzwords as well so

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
it's kind of be mindful of how um

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
how you're coming off to people right

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,320
and i love that elo punk had this at

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,440
girkon recently it's pronounced devops

140
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,719
the sec is silent

141
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
and don't

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
development life cycle as you can tell i

143
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,960
love me i could not find any memes on

144
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
the secure software development life

145
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,199
cycle against me it's the development

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
life cycle security should just be

147
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,240
integrated

148
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
part of that

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
checks

150
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,320
you know

151
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
i've had conversation with managers it

152
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,960
goes to having to support their stuff

153
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
they want peer reviews right

154
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
security thing but what are they doing

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,560
the seniors are checking junior desk

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,919
to make sure they're actually doing

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,840
things properly so that's to me a

158
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
security check unit test

159
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
they want to reduce the cost of

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
development as well right because we

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
talked about shifting left as much as

162
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
possible

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,800
um

164
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
and

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
to do that

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
um they've got to have these certain

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
things and that includes security right

168
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,400
and security

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
tickets are just bugs to me they should

170
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,400
we should not be having work on a low

171
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
security finding that you know when

172
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
they've got high business needs to get

173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
taken care of address it at some point

174
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
but that's where you sit down with them

175
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
and agree upon like an sla

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
so fine i didn't out that's good i

177
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
mean a little bit open-minded to this i

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
may have looked on some people's

179
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
favorite terms you know i'm i'm sorry

180
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,400
but

181
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
um i i to me it's just you know we're

182
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
nothing special we should be coming to

183
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
developers or anybody we work with not

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
just developers coming they're a little

185
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,440
humble trying to see

186
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
the help and

187
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
provide

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,039
them their support

189
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
so social engineering the dev team

190
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
this needs to be an authentic a genuine

191
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,520
thing

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
something a lot of other sales books

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
right coming off as authentic instead of

194
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
manipulative if you manipulate them you

195
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
find out about it you've just lost right

196
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
so you have to come at this from an

197
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
authentic and genuine standpoint um

198
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
that worked for me but so let's apply as

199
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,360
kind of copy go about stuff you should

200
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,639
be looking at these techniques and

201
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
seeing

202
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
them you as a person so again being

203
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,720
genuine and authentic and sometimes

204
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
you're going to fail

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,599
you

206
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,039
developers you know

207
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,080
people

208
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
along with right it's gonna happen again

209
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
that's where the leadership support

210
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
comes in i actually got along with a guy

211
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
really great

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
um we found out we like were born 100

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
miles apart for me

214
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
um and we were lit national tennessee

215
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,840
which crazy um

216
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,599
but the reason why he does it is because

217
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
his leadership is making him do it so

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
people that you just never get to

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,280
but you you can still have a good

220
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,758
relationship

221
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
and that's the the probably the big

222
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
thing right is having an actual

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
relationship with people there's nothing

224
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
surprising getting along with people

225
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
being nice

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
rapport building right so so read the

227
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
social engineering book and you can see

228
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
a lot of that kind of same stuff can be

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,639
applicable as long as it's from an

230
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
authentic and genuine standpoint

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,639
a virtual conference and someone nailed

232
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
it they're like just have empathy right

233
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,599
so

234
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,240
if they get to know them how do you do

235
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,199
this

236
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,560
you kind of start

237
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
getting in with their look look for

238
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,639
their meetings to

239
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,120
have this chicken

240
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,759
and egg want to open a bacon and egg

241
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,360
uh rest

242
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
okay and so the dads see themselves as

243
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,840
pig they have

244
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,479
skin

245
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
pooping up eggs

246
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
you know they're going to see so you try

247
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,720
to be the pig

248
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,520
right

249
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,958
and i never got to that point but they

250
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,479
understand i was there with them because

251
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080
i was going to and i wasn't even saying

252
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
anything right and that's kind of the

253
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
next thing listen right i didn't say

254
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,839
anything i went to their groomings i

255
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
went to their stand-ups

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
and a lot of times like when they know

257
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
the security i mean you're still going

258
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
to have this stigma oh the security is

259
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
here so you kind of try to be that you

260
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
know that animal that just kind of hides

261
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,080
in the brush and just observes and kind

262
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
of gets them more

263
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
associated and like used to you being

264
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
there and also just not calling out

265
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
every little thing right sometimes when

266
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
smaller things you might have to eat

267
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
that blue pill right you have to be

268
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
ciphered and ignorance is bliss

269
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
especially you ask does it really matter

270
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
now if there's an actual yeah no we

271
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
can't do that

272
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
but a lot of times my first three i

273
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,880
spent my first three

274
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,600
out of asking the questions so i didn't

275
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
have to necessarily find stuff they

276
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,959
started bringing stuff to me

277
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,080
and their stuff um ask questions too

278
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
developers love talking about their code

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
you know the turn call somebody's baby

280
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,440
ugly right i just did that for security

281
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
tell

282
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
developers that they're they're babies

283
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
but if you

284
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
get their code and what they're built

285
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,519
all this stuff

286
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
you know they will

287
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,200
you know cut

288
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
asking questions is one of those ways

289
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
that you can interact but really build a

290
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,519
question with someone

291
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,959
this that those

292
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
persons are going to have this too but

293
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
there's

294
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,480
ask questions you want to be a great

295
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
conversation

296
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
don't talk ask the question right that's

297
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
that's what you

298
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
kind of what you do and actively listen

299
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,120
to

300
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
right actually listen to the developers

301
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
and what they're you know i try to

302
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
understand their goals there's

303
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
challenges you know any and i tell them

304
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
this too i want to understand this so i

305
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
ask a lot of questions

306
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
um you know the frustrations things like

307
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
that and and see where you can kind of

308
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
be an enabler for the development team

309
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
um

310
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
reciprocity right so stuff for them is

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
get you i i would walk up to a desk and

312
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
go okay what what do you need for me you

313
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
know

314
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
i just wanted to see if we're gonna go

315
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
grab a lunch or something but oftentimes

316
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
i could walk up to a dev team and they

317
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
would fix it fairly quickly even low

318
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,839
stuff

319
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,959
we need to put this through the proper

320
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
process this is a low needs to be done

321
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
but i got to that point where i got the

322
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,360
um

323
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,480
to to

324
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
uh kind of drop what they're doing and

325
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,399
help me out right

326
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
and it's about giving not receiving so

327
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,760
one of the things that i would do

328
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
is service death tickets i had access to

329
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,959
the service desk tickets i would push

330
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,040
tickets along or reroute them to the to

331
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
the right group if they were in the

332
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
wrong group little things

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
like that say a lot to people so that

334
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
then when i have a security issue

335
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,440
they're going to drop what they're going

336
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
to help me

337
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
the other thing i like to do is bring

338
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
bacon right

339
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
um who doesn't love bacon so this is 144

340
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
pieces of bacon bought it at sam's uh

341
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
it's 272 packs for about 20 bucks

342
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,959
i was doing secure security training

343
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
and i brought this and dropped it on the

344
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
table and i will tell you the look on

345
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
their faces when they came in was was

346
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,680
great is that is that bacon

347
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
no one ever brought them bacon right

348
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
it's a little bit harder now with the

349
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,399
remote stuff but if you can try to find

350
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,680
those opportunities to to you know swag

351
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
those uh little

352
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
privacy sliders

353
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
on the monitors go grab a handful

354
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
they love that those stuff i was handing

355
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
out those like like crazy i always grab

356
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,160
a handful from a conference bring them

357
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
back hey tim you got you got one of

358
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,440
those privacy cameras yeah there you go

359
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,000
right it's simple things like that that

360
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
i'm i'm going on my way to do stuff um i

361
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
also in the training one of my first

362
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,760
slides was talking about security wins

363
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
right so what did they do right well and

364
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,639
and it was amazing because and i would

365
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
hand out swag so i got the company to

366
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
give me a ton of swag and these were all

367
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,760
little things pens notebooks coffee mugs

368
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,040
you know nothing super fancy or special

369
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,160
and i would call them out and you know

370
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
what happened the two weeks afterwards

371
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
they would bring me security stuff for

372
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,519
like two weeks

373
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
after the training of stuff that needed

374
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
to be addressed right

375
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
this stuff

376
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,920
they're reaching out to me

377
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
and again this is where this story

378
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,079
applies to me you kind of think creative

379
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,839
resources to get developer stuff

380
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,160
or get them on your side um

381
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
language right

382
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,680
um you can do a lot of reading with bob

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
and

384
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,320
if

385
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
you ever know

386
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
if you're at a conference and you feel

387
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
like you're really engaged with someone

388
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,000
watch their body language and see if

389
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
it's mirrored you and then what you do

390
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
is you shift your body language and see

391
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,120
if

392
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,760
they shift right it's

393
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
when you see it happen and i've been

394
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
called someone and was talking to

395
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,639
someone about this technique and they

396
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,480
would and then i shifted like almost

397
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,839
immediately after and they shifted to

398
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,440
and they were like oh whoa whoa whoa

399
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
that's really freaky it's really it's

400
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
really freaky when you see it happen but

401
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
body language is important i will say

402
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,920
how you dress if you're coming into a

403
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,639
dev

404
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,800
group that's got you know hoodies and

405
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
t-shirts and other stuff and you're

406
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,040
wearing like a suit or you know a

407
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,880
collared shirt like a button-up collar

408
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
shirt or you know tucked in and

409
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
everything you're going to stick out to

410
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
them right so you kind of you kind of

411
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
want to blend in a little bit again

412
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,959
don't go to the actually dressing

413
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,480
because that fit what

414
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
personality best i would still wear a

415
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
collared shirt but i'd wear like the one

416
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
untucked jeans you know some some i got

417
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
some adidas shoes on here and then i'd

418
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
roll up the sleeves right so so that was

419
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,519
that was what i am comfortable with

420
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
that's what i consider business casual

421
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,000
you know i'm i'm former military so i do

422
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,680
have some of that you know

423
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,519
looking looking professional when you go

424
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,240
into work um but you know there are

425
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,760
opportunities for that i actually do

426
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
like wearing hats i was wearing them

427
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
early part

428
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
all remote and i stopped um but like

429
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,639
when i go like a dev like if i'm in a

430
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,680
dead meet or something i might throw it

431
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,959
back on because there are other people

432
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,720
wearing hats right so you kind of want

433
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
to connect with people with kind of how

434
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
you dress um and again remote work has

435
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
kind of changed a lot of this stuff so

436
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,440
it's a lot harder to see body language

437
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
on a camera right

438
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,560
and we'll talk about some of the remote

439
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,800
work the stuff that you can do um be

440
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
vulnerable right be transparent don't

441
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
hide anything from them right

442
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
give give them you know i i was

443
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,959
transparent i'm always transparent with

444
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,240
them i'm like

445
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,720
we should not have bottlenecks or

446
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,600
roadblocks for deploying code right that

447
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,639
doesn't mean we're not going to put in

448
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,880
some speed bumps here and there right so

449
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
i i was very upfront transparent i told

450
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
them my whole plan right it was three

451
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,120
months sit with them you know the next

452
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
six at six months we should probably

453
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
start looking at some tooling some

454
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
testing putting that in place you know i

455
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,480
gave the whole pant the whole plan and

456
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,839
if you and if you have you know you

457
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,959
should have a plan before you start

458
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,639
working with the dev team you should be

459
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,320
able to share that with them and where

460
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
you want to go now part of the three

461
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
months is me trying to understand where

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
security best fits in because i do not

463
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,320
want to go in and start disrupting how

464
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
they're developing code because that's

465
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,199
going to piss them off

466
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,480
that means that i

467
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
want to work with you right

468
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,759
um i also admitting right if i'm wrong

469
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,959
about it

470
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
i admit i'm i'm wrong i've actually been

471
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,639
a better security person because they

472
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
would question some stuff

473
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
and we'd have sometimes i would win the

474
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
case other times i would be like okay

475
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,160
yeah maybe maybe you don't need to worry

476
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,399
about that um and again be authentic

477
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,000
with all this stuff

478
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
not manipulative if you're manipulative

479
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
you're gonna lose them pretty pretty

480
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,199
quickly but in general just kind of be

481
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,040
truthful and honest and they're gonna

482
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,560
that's gonna resonate with them true

483
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
being honest with someone about

484
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,199
something that maybe you shouldn't tell

485
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
them i mean

486
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,480
there are certain lines within security

487
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
and stuff but sometimes being truthful

488
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,600
with them they know they're sharing

489
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,199
something maybe you shouldn't be sharing

490
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
with them or they haven't had in the

491
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,240
past

492
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,759
had a bad experience with security

493
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
people so if you're more open to them

494
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
um they're going to be like holy like i

495
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
can actually trust this person

496
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
the working from home challenge right

497
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,399
this this makes building relationships a

498
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
lot harder if you've heard of the allen

499
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,720
curve there's the whole like and this is

500
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
a study done in the 70s the the more

501
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
distance the less communication you have

502
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,560
um and it it can it can really hurt like

503
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
it's really tough to keep those

504
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
relationships going i was fortunate my

505
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
current some of my current devs i was in

506
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,959
the office with them so they know me i

507
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
had that established relationship but

508
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
i've been trying to work on building

509
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
with you know remote people i've got

510
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,119
people out in

511
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,079
san diego got people in san antonio it's

512
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
really hard i try to go there like i

513
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,359
would travel there to try and you know

514
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
connect with them and catch up and you

515
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,799
know have a couple meetings go out and

516
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
have some have some adult beverages

517
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,880
but you really have to look for a lot of

518
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
opportunities to connect if i'm in a

519
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
meeting just like a general meeting with

520
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,360
a developer

521
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,280
i might like reach out on like an iam

522
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,480
and just send them a message hey man

523
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
how's it going right and this is where

524
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
you can look for opportunities to

525
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
connect on

526
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
your other interest i'm a big baseball

527
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
fan so i have a cleveland indians fan at

528
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,320
work i mean go back and forth about like

529
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
baseball stuff it could be woodworking

530
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
it could be you know whatever your

531
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
interests are trying to identify um some

532
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
of that stuff and you pick up that stuff

533
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,919
just even sitting in the meetings right

534
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,919
and trying to understand who these

535
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,039
people are and what some of their

536
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,160
interests are

537
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
um

538
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,160
i i do set up local events like happy

539
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,080
hour for us to connect i think even now

540
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
like a lot a lot of my company's going

541
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
remote um we're going to do some sort of

542
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
hybrid workforce thing so it so for me

543
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
those local events become even more

544
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,799
relevant especially if you're in the

545
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,400
same city with them right you can you

546
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
can try to take

547
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
i'm up here

548
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
that's that's some reciprocity right

549
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,160
there

550
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
you know and it always going to these

551
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,559
meetings online the stand-ups other

552
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,080
stuff

553
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,799
very very important i have a 30-minute

554
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,039
catch-up meeting with uh our director of

555
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
development that's been there since

556
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,280
2016. that's one of those

557
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
if you can't get in with the director of

558
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
development or manager the scrum masters

559
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,679
are really great because they know

560
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
everything that's going on hey what are

561
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
you trying to do what do you because and

562
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,080
they have their own frustration

563
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
development

564
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
that they're trying to put certain

565
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,720
processes in place so you look for

566
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
opportunities on where you can help them

567
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
and they kind of know everything

568
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
um

569
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,039
pay attention to your box

570
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
i don't know if anybody's seen that demo

571
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
where they have uh the guy does the

572
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,360
different um different

573
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
looking around the person with the

574
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
multiple cups that's constantly drinking

575
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
that's actually mean by the

576
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
the guy the bottom left corner is a guy

577
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
how you're presenting that little box is

578
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
is very important

579
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,400
media media arts grad um

580
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
if you've ever seen a movie where there

581
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
were like faces have shaded that's

582
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
intentional to make

583
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,240
or the person's really dark so make sure

584
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
you have like good lighting i'm not

585
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,960
always perfect about it either i often

586
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
just sit outside and you

587
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
have those things that you can light up

588
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,200
if you can get one of those but

589
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
i see you

590
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
and not working like it really drives me

591
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,919
enough for working nowadays but like not

592
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,440
working and actually paying attention to

593
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
what they're saying um

594
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
so uh with that in mind

595
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
i think i'm doing pretty good time one

596
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
of my favorites is uh office office

597
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
space and there's a really good

598
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
scene i think you guys all know this

599
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
where peter's meeting the bob's and it's

600
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
a great

601
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,520
example of how some of these techniques

602
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,720
can work because we're talking about a

603
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,919
very quick

604
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,159
you know introduction and you know

605
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,520
getting to know people so there's a lot

606
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
of the same techniques i've talked about

607
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,960
in here that apply to

608
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,000
uh this scene

609
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,919
first people that haven't seen office

610
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
space um there's the bobs who are coming

611
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
in to pretty much re-org they're

612
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,240
essentially coming in to fire people uh

613
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
and so peter's one of the people being

614
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
interviewed at this point he's at a

615
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
don't really care anymore

616
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,559
um

617
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,480
so and he starts by coming in going hi

618
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,919
bob there's another technique i haven't

619
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,000
talked about is is using people's names

620
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
use people's names as communication

621
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,039
people like seeing their name they love

622
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,240
hearing their name if you have an

623
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
opportunity you know use uh use people's

624
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,159
names

625
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,880
um you can see here they're both kind of

626
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,080
um

627
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,199
walk through the typical day

628
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,840
these are all intentional too this is

629
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
this is a scene that's meant to make you

630
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,039
feel good and laugh a little bit um

631
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,480
you can see bob leaning forward too

632
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,919
leaning forward is an indication that

633
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,520
you're interested in somebody and that

634
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
you're actively listening and you see

635
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
peter's sitting there straight up and by

636
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
the way this is not developers or

637
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
security on either side it's the rating

638
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
people that

639
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
interact

640
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
how that like they built fairly quickly

641
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,480
um so and also showing your hands is a

642
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
good thing i know it's hard with zoom

643
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
but people who have their hands like if

644
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
i stood here like this you guys would

645
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,720
you'd have this

646
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
eerie feeling of not trusting me

647
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
um so having your hand show is really

648
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
good um and he goes into you know about

649
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,240
being 15 minutes late and using the door

650
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
so he's actually being very open and

651
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
transparent about you know what he does

652
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,880
at work

653
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
um and

654
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,000
instead bob's getting on him they go

655
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,559
space out what do you mean space out um

656
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
and he says after lunch

657
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
after lunch two he kind of get you know

658
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,840
he spaces out in a given week he

659
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
probably does 15 minutes of real actual

660
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
work so again being open and transparent

661
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
and the bobs are going tell us more

662
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
right tell us more about this so they're

663
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
trying to understand the goals and

664
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
challenges

665
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
um and then you can see like prior to

666
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
this he relaxes let me tell you about

667
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,120
tps reports right and so they cut away

668
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,960
in the back to this scene where they're

669
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,559
talking you can see the bobs are still

670
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
engaged they're leaning forward

671
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
peter's you know relaxed um and he's

672
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
being very copen

673
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
uh

674
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,080
very open about this right um he's like

675
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,200
so

676
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
he's

677
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,640
you mean you don't care

678
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
so again um and he says if the company

679
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
ships more unit he doesn't get a dime so

680
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,960
again he's being very open and candid

681
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,280
about his position so peter relaxes

682
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,559
again and you can see this is where the

683
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,960
body match body language matches the

684
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
other bob leans back matching peter

685
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,080
leaning back right so he's really

686
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,799
engaged in this conversation

687
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,960
um

688
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,720
and then here is you know he leans

689
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,640
forward again he goes what if right

690
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
gives you some sort of stock option

691
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,640
would you be open to this um and peter

692
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
goes i don't know i guess right he's

693
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
still being candid right he's still

694
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
being open he's being a person um and

695
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
then he says you know real nice talking

696
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,799
to both you guys so um and then they do

697
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,400
the handshake which is another form of

698
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,679
interaction that i know have gone away

699
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,520
with covet um hopefully he's coming back

700
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,200
carry hands on the title by the way the

701
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
con going to a conference prepared me

702
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
for the pandemic right hand sanitizer in

703
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
the pocket anytime i shape someone shake

704
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
someone's hand rub a little on there

705
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
don't touch my face you know all this

706
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,840
usual stuff um but but then the bob's go

707
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,520
no pleasure's all set on this table

708
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
thank you so thank you so appreciation

709
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
that's another one that i i'm kind of

710
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
blowing through here is saying thank you

711
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,760
a lot every communication say thank you

712
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
and this doesn't have to be just

713
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,080
developers but say thank you there's so

714
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
many times i you know it feels good for

715
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,760
people to feel like they've done

716
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
something

717
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,039
for you right

718
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,320
and then peter says good luck with your

719
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
firings i hope they go really well and

720
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
this is another form

721
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,720
of matching thumbling thumbs up in the

722
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,000
other and you can see there bob he's

723
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,320
even at like eye level like you see i'm

724
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
interacting yeah thumbs up right um and

725
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,000
then of course the scene ends with

726
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
everything not to do

727
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
which is lumber

728
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
um

729
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
so and he walks up here he says so peter

730
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,960
what's happening listen so he does he

731
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,159
asks a question but he doesn't really

732
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,880
care right listen he's looking down he's

733
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,799
not making eye contact and what does

734
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,960
peter do just walks right by him right

735
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,279
so um that's a great demo of kind of

736
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,480
some of these techniques i've talked

737
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,799
about and how you can interact um the

738
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,640
number one activity i did that really

739
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
helped with uh kind of

740
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
this this uh

741
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,000
getting shifting left and getting

742
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,360
developers to write better code is

743
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
threat modeling

744
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,840
um

745
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
i it's this is adam show us textbook i

746
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
read the first chapter and actually at

747
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,240
the end of his first chapter he says

748
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,440
just go start threat modeling because

749
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,799
you can get into some a lot more cons

750
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,159
but it's ultimately

751
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,760
diagramming a workflow and talking

752
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,960
through attack panners with them and i

753
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,679
think it's uh that's not dreaded stride

754
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
is what i use is and i keep it simple

755
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,480
right um and so

756
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,679
you know this is one and this was

757
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
probably one of the last things i

758
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,799
implemented because i started with

759
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,400
testing anything new going out you know

760
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
we're going to test we're going to put

761
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
some automation in and then once we

762
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
started talking about design i said

763
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
anytime you have a design idea we need

764
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,159
to go through a threat well i also re

765
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,919
re-changed it from threat model to data

766
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
flow discussion right so i'm thinking

767
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
about and it's a small thing right it's

768
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
not maybe a threat modeling may have

769
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,720
been a good thing but a data flow

770
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
discussion to me sounds a lot more like

771
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
it's beneficial to them and we did find

772
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
out when we were doing threat modeling

773
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,559
that um they were

774
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,799
they weren't always on the same page

775
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
even in that design session where they

776
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,799
feel like they had a solution right oh i

777
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,679
thought we were going to build it here

778
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,039
no we're going to build it here like

779
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,600
that's a big big thing right that's a

780
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,480
difference

781
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,440
um so that that and that shows value to

782
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,799
managers too is that we're getting

783
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
everybody on the same page right um and

784
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,559
that's not even a security thing so so

785
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,320
even there it was it was just a good

786
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
meeting to have but then we walked

787
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
through attack techniques um and this is

788
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
where their mindset switched right so

789
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
you have to kind of be quiet and let

790
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,880
them try to speak up and come up with

791
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
their own stuff which is really hard for

792
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,039
us security people again that's where

793
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,880
a silent room someone's going to speak

794
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
up if i you know

795
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,080
i don't think if i stop talking here but

796
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,279
if you're in a room and you just stop

797
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
talking like someone's gonna at some

798
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
point say something right

799
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,279
people don't like awkward silences

800
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,520
um but and if they have problem you can

801
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,679
throw them a very simple example what i

802
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,520
did was what if i give you a million

803
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,880
dollars for access and have you write

804
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,039
this code or or install this thing on

805
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
your machine or install it into you know

806
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
something with them they're like wait

807
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,640
you can't oh

808
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,559
so at that point it really flipped their

809
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,559
mindset to understand that they needed

810
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,720
to think outside the box and from there

811
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
started with really creative attack

812
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,679
solutions because they know the code

813
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,679
right they also know the solutions to

814
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
that as well right

815
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
and certain you know and you can go as

816
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,880
far as like mission impossible style

817
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,159
stuff because we're probably starting to

818
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,080
see some of that stuff with solarwinds

819
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
and there are a couple cases recently

820
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,200
where someone bribed like an employee to

821
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
install something on their machine so

822
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,480
those are absolutely things but it

823
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
really switched their mindset and so now

824
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
as they're writing the code they're

825
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,039
going oh wait you know

826
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,240
you've kind of flipped that attacker

827
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,760
mindset on them so when they're writing

828
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
the code they're actually thinking about

829
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,159
this kind of stuff

830
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,520
uh resources

831
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
phoenix project if you haven't read it

832
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
and you're working with development team

833
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
go read it they've probably read it

834
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,919
it's a very good book

835
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,919
security is not in a good light in that

836
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,399
book um i think it kind of comes out in

837
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,399
the end but it's a great book to kind of

838
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,799
understand like process and and how they

839
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,640
want to you know do

840
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,000
development and code and things like

841
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
this devops type stuff um and then again

842
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
you know i've talked i've already talked

843
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,520
about chris head and aggie social

844
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,159
engineering books um when friends and

845
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,520
how to win friends and influence people

846
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,200
these are sales books right these are

847
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,720
things that sales people but this is

848
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
really great for building relationships

849
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,080
um one of the things i like to say is

850
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
there's three types of power in an

851
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,320
organization right there is role power

852
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,399
there is um

853
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
uh technical power right so what you

854
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,720
know and then there's relationship

855
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
anybody that's been successful knows

856
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
that they got there because of the

857
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
relationships they have built within an

858
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,799
organization and with even within the

859
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,640
community i think um stefan on the

860
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,159
previous talk talked about networking

861
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,480
right that's powerful for a job search

862
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
so and it's true just about every aspect

863
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,600
of life

864
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
seven habits of highly effective people

865
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,840
and then more recently ego is the enemy

866
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,919
um ryan holiday has got some really good

867
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,679
books on like stoicism and things like

868
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,440
that obstacles the way so you can find

869
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
creative solutions to stuff is another

870
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
great book

871
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,399
with that i've got two minutes for

872
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,919
questions

873
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,600
um if there are any and i think i have

874
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,520
to i have something to give away for the

875
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,039
first person that get asked the question

876
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
sir

877
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
um

878
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,279
uh so the question was for a team that's

879
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,559
out there like are you talking about

880
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,919
like you've never worked with them

881
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,919
before you know that's where you have to

882
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,120
have again that's where you have to have

883
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,960
some of the leadership buy-in

884
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
um on stuff

885
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,679
it's very hard we all suck at it um you

886
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,760
know i use bottom line up front as far

887
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,880
as i'm gonna start talking about email

888
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,080
techniques because i haven't been in

889
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
that situation um and again my dev group

890
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
two was like 50 people so i have again i

891
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,720
have a different experience so you have

892
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,559
to kind of figure out where some of this

893
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,200
stuff can fit in with your stuff

894
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
keep it short bottom

895
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,440
a lot of people write their email point

896
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
on the bottom move that to the top and

897
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,279
then a sentence or two

898
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,480
that's

899
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
people will ask for context of stuff and

900
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,159
that's what i found a great way to

901
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,200
interact and get people to actually

902
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,720
respond if you write two paragraphs of

903
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
stuff i even look at it and i go

904
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,679
no i'm not gonna save this for later

905
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,600
right so kind of being crisp and clean

906
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,960
if you're talking about sending an email

907
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,600
to somebody um but you know it's like

908
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,919
it's getting leadership and

909
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,279
the probably reach out to like the

910
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,399
director of development or something

911
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,440
that's where you got to start or a scrum

912
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
master or something to kind of hey you

913
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
know and it's really hard

914
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,640
been pushed out of work groups

915
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,919
leadership at the top had made a

916
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,520
business call and stuff and i just have

917
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
to accept that sometimes right

918
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,120
um so that might be where you know your

919
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,200
leadership or or you kind of start

920
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,960
trying to build that relationship and

921
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
ask questions again i start with a

922
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
question too bottom line up front i
