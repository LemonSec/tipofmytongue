have today

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,320
we are going to talk about security

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,640
awareness maturity assessments

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,359
so

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,240
um

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
hopefully you guys get something from

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
this and if not i have

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
tons of other things to teach you so um

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,840
like i said my name is rose i am a

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,479
governance risk and compliance manager

at a company called cso we do red blue

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,559
and grc services

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
i own the governance and compliance

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,879
service line meaning everything that

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,039
falls through that really large grc

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,440
umbrella is my responsibility i oversee

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
the the delivery of it i

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,840
have a master's in cyber security a

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,680
advanced networking and i just

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
[Music]

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,920
um

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
15 years in it and then the last nine in

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
security so

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
i have been spending quite a long time

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
in it a lot of different things and so

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,280
over the years i've really enjoyed

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
teaching others the things that i've

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
picked up along the way

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
additionally shameless plug guys i do a

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
lot of public speaking so if you are

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
interested in governance risk and

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
compliance i have tons of talks

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,759
available you can get to them through my

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
linkedin page

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,680
done podcasts and a whole bunch of

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
things relating to isms and third

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,680
parties management and then

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
if you are not familiar with setting up

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
an entire security awareness program i

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
have a talk on that too so today we're

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
just focusing on maturity assessments

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
whereas there's another talk available

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
if you need some help setting up your

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
whole program

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,479
all right so security awareness programs

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
let's level set there first

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
um do any of you in here have your own

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
security awareness program that you run

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
or contribute to

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
a few hands okay great so when we talk

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,480
about security awareness that program

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
is fundamental to what we're doing at an

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,239
organization

55
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,560
um there's a lot of purposes behind it

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
maybe we're trying to give better

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
training to people

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
we're focusing on certain topics

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
computer network physical whatever it

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
may be

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
but ultimately we are trying to change

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,239
the behavior and the culture and

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,519
facilitating these really great

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,680
conversations with our workforce because

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
ultimately we want to have a reduction

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
in the risk related to human behavior so

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,959
[Music]

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,959
security awareness typically has the

69
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
wrap of you know this is a compliance

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
activity

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
really we're trying to reduce the risk

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
associated with our humans within our

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
workforce so we do this through security

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
awareness

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
now your program is

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
normally split into two different areas

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
you have your program you know it's the

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
compliance and regulatory aspects of it

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
you have your c-level support

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
you um maybe have your governance

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000
whatever your governance may

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
with other departments and then you have

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,519
so that is what is setting up your

84
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,480
program

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
the other side of your program is

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
training so you have training and

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
activities that you give to your

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,239
workforce and you also have social

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,400
engineering so

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
from there you have several training

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,280
types so you have web-based you may do

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
in-person correspondence or you may do

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
behavioral or role or group-based

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
training so

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,519
program and then your training and

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,599
that's coming together to develop your

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
program or level set your program

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
so security awareness level setting

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
there

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
now we're going to talk about maturity

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
assessments because that is the main

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,840
purpose of this talk

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,879
so maturity assessments not here to

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
say hey go out and get a third party to

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
do it not saying you need to

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,439
do all this jump through hoops to get

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,799
maturity assessment done for your

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,840
program

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
what i want to do is enable you guys to

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
take this information and go conduct

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,440
your maturity assessment against your

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
own program and understand how your

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,000
program is truly operated

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
so maturity assessments they look at

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
your current state they evaluate how

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,400
you're sitting what you're doing what

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
you're not doing and figuring out where

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,759
you want to go do you want to have

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
a level 3 maturity a level 4 maturity do

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,080
you have no maturity and you don't

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
actually realize it because maybe your

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
program is very immature

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
all of this is going to play a key role

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,960
into your maturity assessment

125
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,479
so when i do maturity

126
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
fairness i am normally looking for four

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,120
components i'm looking

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,520
looking at how you execute the program

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
i'm looking at your staffing and your

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
metrics so those four things i am

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
normally looking at as they relate back

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,199
to your program and your training

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,320
so

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
we have a breakdown here breakdown is

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
governance what exactly am i talking

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,479
about because that could be kind of

137
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,479
vague so do you have a policy do you

138
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
have a standard do you have some sort of

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,039
strategic plan all of these are going to

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,680
support your program and your governance

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
is going to need to be established to be

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
able to run your program effectively i

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
will tell you now if you do not have

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
governance when a maturity assessment is

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
being done you likely will be a stage

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
one type maturity because you don't have

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,479
anything to govern your program that

148
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,680
experiences therefore it's going to

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
drive all the things that you need to do

150
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
next you have execution

151
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,520
who's

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
executing on your program is your

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
workforce actually picking up the

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
information what kind of training is

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
available all of these things play a key

156
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
role into how this program is actually

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,199
executing and how it's being

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,919
administered within the environment

159
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
oh my apologies did not mean to click

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
next

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,639
next

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
staff so

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
how many of you that actually run your

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,560
own program are doing it in a dedicated

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,280
fashion or part-time so

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,160
raise of hands dedicated to your program

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
right now

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
one person

169
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,199
so

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
most programs operated in a percentage

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
capacity

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,600
20 whatever it may be

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
okay well you're going to have likely a

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
mature program because it's not getting

175
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
the support and the resources that it

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
needs

177
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
so when a maturity assessment is done

178
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,120
you're looking at do you have the

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
qualified staff do you have the people

180
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
you need to run it are those people

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
educated on how to administer administer

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
your program

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
do they have soft skills another key

184
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,919
aspect here with security awareness it's

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
not all you know you're sending the

186
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,080
training out

187
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
policies and lms and doing these sort of

188
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,479
things you need certain soft skills to

189
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
administer the program and communicate

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
with the workforce

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,479
so that's another comes through

192
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,599
staff

193
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
then finally metrics

194
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
are you understanding how your program

195
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
operates are you taking

196
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,919
going back into continual improvement

197
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,280
are the only metrics that you're

198
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
gathering is whether or not everybody

199
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
completed their training because if so

200
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
that's not good metrics of how your

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,960
program is operating there's a lot that

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
filters into there okay i see a head

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,800
shaking back there yeah that's the only

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
metrics you do

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
yeah so a lot of times people have the

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
metrics of

207
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
everybody did their training the

208
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,319
auditors come in that show that

209
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,840
everybody did their training and that

210
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,080
sort of counts for their metrics well

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
that's not really going to show how your

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
program's operating right you need to

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
understand look at your ir processes how

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
many business email compromises are you

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
having how many phishing attempts of

216
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
those people with phishing and business

217
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
email compromises are they getting the

218
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
right training are you reporting on it

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
are you doing all these other things so

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
the metrics really play a key part here

221
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,479
in making sure that you cycle back into

222
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,160
your continual improvement so if you do

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,479
have a lot of business email compromise

224
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
are you adjusting your training and

225
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
making sure those repeat offenders or

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
your

227
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
problem kids are taking the training

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,919
that they need to so a lot to consider

229
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
there

230
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
to add another tricky aspect into your

231
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,039
program or the things that you need to

232
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
consider for your maturity assessment

233
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
is compliance and regulatory

234
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
so we've talked about at a very vague

235
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
level you have security awareness

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
programs that have your program in your

237
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,279
training

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,440
you may get influenced by

239
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,799
compliance and regulatory factors

240
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
those are a lot of things to take into

241
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
consideration for your program you need

242
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,760
to have the metrics you need to have

243
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,399
staffing you need to do x y and z of the

244
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
things and the compliance and regulatory

245
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
factors make it even more complicated

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,920
for iso 27001 you have to have the

247
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
training you have to show that they have

248
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
the training you may have to demonstrate

249
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
that they signed off on the information

250
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
security policy that may be incorporated

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
into the security awareness

252
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
nist 853 there's a whole domain

253
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
awareness and training for

254
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
your security awareness program

255
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
so lots of things to consider there when

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
you're building your program and making

257
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
sure that you're evaluating the maturity

258
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
of your program against what's

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
applicable to your environment

260
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
out of the people running their programs

261
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
do you guys have any regulatory factors

262
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,880
right now

263
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,560
that are driving your programs

264
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,880
what about you what do you have driving

265
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,279
your program

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
okay

267
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
yeah

268
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
anybody else

269
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
oh

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,279
that's everybody's favorite

271
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,720
any other regulatory drivers in here

272
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
i work with a lot of environments oh in

273
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
the back

274
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
oh i have a security role in privacy

275
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,320
rules

276
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
yeah so um i work with a lot of clients

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,519
that have a lot of different regulatory

278
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,640
factors like there and you start

279
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
stacking them up they get more and more

280
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
and more complex

281
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
so um definitely take that into

282
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
consideration for your maturity

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,440
assessment

284
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
all right a really useful tool if you

285
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
have not seen this i am not going to

286
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,800
tell you guys to reinvent the wheel

287
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
because if you have not already

288
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
researched it there's 50 million

289
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
maturity models out there and in

290
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
particular sans has one for your

291
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
security awareness program they already

292
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
did all the hard work for you just got

293
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
to go to their website

294
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,839
get this chart get it

295
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
so we do have the security awareness

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
maturity model here i did steal it from

297
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
sans but i did give them credit so you

298
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
guys can go to that link

299
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,279
now the maturity model is in five levels

300
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,959
you have non-existent

301
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
you're not doing anything your users

302
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
don't even have any idea what is

303
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
security awareness

304
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
don't open the emails they don't know

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
anything then you have compliance focus

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,560
and this is where a lot of organizations

307
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,000
that i work with normally sit they

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,760
have people that sign off on the policy

309
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
they maybe take training once a year

310
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
they admit that meet the minimum

311
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
requirements that's expected of them for

312
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
their compliance focus program

313
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
so they

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
aren't doing anything more than that

315
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
maybe they want to but maybe they don't

316
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,720
have the buy-in for it

317
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
then you have promoting awareness and

318
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
behavioral change so now you're you're

319
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
going on that uphill trend you have your

320
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
security team they're actively looking

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
at people they're identifying human risk

322
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
and associating that back into their

323
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,519
program

324
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,120
you have the users that are starting to

325
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
acknowledge the security awareness

326
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
habits that you want them to have

327
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
they're maybe getting a hold of security

328
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
and doing the things that you're hoping

329
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
they would take from the training

330
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,639
you have long term and cultural change

331
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
so big one here the cultural change

332
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
that's what you really want to see so

333
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
going back to the purpose of security

334
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,600
awareness you want to see that reduction

335
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
in risk related to your humans

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,519
well when you start hitting that fourth

337
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,200
layer you're going to see that cultural

338
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
change and really start to see that

339
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
reduction in the human risk

340
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
additionally that human risk should be

341
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
accounted for when you're doing your

342
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,040
other risk management type functions to

343
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
further reduce it

344
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,639
and then metrics so going back to

345
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
continual improvement you have the

346
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,120
continual improvement for your program

347
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
you're able to demonstrate that through

348
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
your metrics

349
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
and these aren't metrics like oh

350
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
everybody did the training everybody did

351
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
this these are very complex metrics to

352
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
put you in that state of continuous

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,120
improvement

354
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,519
all that information is within the

355
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
infographic in that link you could just

356
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
google it it comes up very quick so

357
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
they've already done the work for you

358
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,639
you can leverage this resource to do

359
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,839
your own maturity assessment

360
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,480
all right so far we've talked about the

361
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,839
different components that i've looked at

362
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
we've talked about a maturity model so

363
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
i'm going to tell you how i normally

364
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,079
execute a maturity assessment

365
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
you could take it or leave it or modify

366
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,760
it however you like but this is what i

367
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,959
normally do so for execution i figure

368
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,519
out who do i want to talk to so you have

369
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
stakeholders for your program your

370
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,680
stakeholders may be compliance maybe hr

371
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,279
your security team

372
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,519
anybody that is invested in that program

373
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,959
maybe you want to talk to management and

374
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
see what their perspective is how the

375
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
security program is operating

376
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
another stakeholder you may want to talk

377
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,000
to

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
are the users

379
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,519
are the users getting any benefit from

380
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,839
the training because a lot of times what

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
i see is a disconnect between the people

382
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
administering the program and the people

383
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
taking the program so whenever you have

384
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,040
security awareness you're supposed to

385
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
market security awareness to your users

386
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,519
you want them to buy invest in the

387
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
skills that were

388
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
so why not talk to them and make sure to

389
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
see what their perspective is

390
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,920
you know they're just getting all this

391
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000
email and it's not really beneficial for

392
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
them well now you know that that's not

393
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,720
really working for your org

394
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,519
um

395
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,279
you provided documents

396
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,320
so

397
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
not everybody's gonna love to do this i

398
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,600
personally love to do this this is why i

399
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
work in government sourcing compliance

400
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
but you need to look at the policy you

401
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,959
need to look at standards you need to

402
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,959
look at the plan if those things are

403
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,600
available if they are not available then

404
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
obviously you can't look at but you

405
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,199
already know they'll have probably a

406
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
level one maturity or you'll have a

407
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
level one maturity

408
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,199
review the provided training

409
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
again you want the users to invest in

410
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
these skills

411
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,000
you have to look at the training you

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
can't just rely like oh yeah you have

413
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
the training that's not going to be good

414
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
you've got to look at the training and

415
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
see if it's actually beneficial

416
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,279
then you want to prep your interview

417
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,399
questions

418
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,680
so

419
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
don't go to your interviews or whoever

420
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,440
you're talk to

421
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
and have an ad hoc conversation you want

422
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,360
to get the most out of their time and

423
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
your time so prep some interview

424
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,959
questions in advance

425
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
again sans already did a lot of that

426
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,560
heavy lift for you a lot of those

427
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
questions you could easily get from that

428
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
graphic that i pointed you to

429
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
you'll want to determine how you record

430
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,399
your responses i know this seems like a

431
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
wacky one to put in here

432
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,639
after many many years doing all sorts of

433
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
assessments i have learned

434
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
figure out how you like to write whether

435
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
it's onenote a spreadsheet a word

436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,839
document

437
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,040
whatever it is just know that in advance

438
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
and then finally understand the

439
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
compliance and regulatory factors

440
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
because

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,000
ultimately that is what the program's

442
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
trying to achieve

443
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
they're trying to first hit those

444
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
compliance drivers because that's likely

445
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,279
going to have a business impact if you

446
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,880
work in healthcare they're going to be

447
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
concerned about hipaa if you're going

448
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
after all these other certifications

449
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,160
like iso or whatever those are going to

450
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
have business imperative so

451
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
make sure you understand the compliance

452
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,800
and regulatory drivers

453
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
now we have governance so this is where

454
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
i start to break it down a little bit

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
more for you guys

456
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
you'll see that we have stage one all

457
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
the way through five on here

458
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,399
starting at the top you have no

459
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,079
awareness program

460
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,000
across the board every area that we're

461
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
gonna look at

462
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,680
no awareness program no observable

463
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
actions when we hit that stage one

464
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
compliance focused um employees are a

465
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
little unsure of the policies if a

466
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,720
policy does exist it's only there to

467
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
satisfy the compliance requirements so

468
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
say you wrote up a policy

469
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
you got it signed off and really it's

470
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,959
just hey we'll do the training annually

471
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
and you're you're satisfying what the

472
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
audit or whatever is going to expect of

473
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
you

474
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
then we hit stage three this is where

475
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,600
you see the actual improvements start to

476
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
happen you have a plan you know what

477
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
your program is trying to do

478
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,560
and you have leadership support so big

479
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,600
item there

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
leadership support

481
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,440
your program is only going to be as

482
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
successful as your leaders are bought

483
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,839
into it so

484
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
that top-down approach is key here and

485
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
then long-term your program is actively

486
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,720
reviewed and updated on annual basis so

487
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,079
it's not good enough to just have the

488
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,359
plan

489
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,720
you want to make sure the plan is

490
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
actively reviewed

491
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,480
you're continuously improving it

492
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
and then making sure that that's

493
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,199
available to whoever it needs to be

494
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
available to

495
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
next we have execution

496
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,359
again no observable things happening for

497
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,000
stage one here but stage two you have

498
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,679
limited support

499
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,640
you

500
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
your leadership may

501
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,039
perceive security as a technical issue

502
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,480
how many of you guys have been in an

503
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
environment where

504
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
you don't necessarily have security

505
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,760
awareness in place but your leadership's

506
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,640
all for throwing new technologies or

507
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
tools onto your infrastructure to fix

508
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,559
the issue

509
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
maybe it's better email

510
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,640
protections maybe it's a sim maybe it's

511
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
whatever and they're thinking that fixes

512
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
the issues when really you're still

513
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
going to have the human risk regardless

514
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,640
of the technology that you put in place

515
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
so if you guys are experiencing that

516
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
that's indicating you're at a stage two

517
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
maturity your leadership's not bought

518
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
into the human risk factor yet they're

519
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,559
giving you money for the tools in your

520
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,400
so stage three

521
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
winning the program they know their top

522
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,559
human risk

523
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
security awareness is considered a part

524
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
of the overall security effort so big

525
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
item here

526
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
i was recently a part of a meeting the

527
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,600
team recognized that we were getting a

528
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
lot of smishing so we have the special

529
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
meeting we talk about all the security

530
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,480
issues and we identified oh man we have

531
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
a lot of users getting smishing wouldn't

532
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
you know the next day we send out a

533
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
newsletter say hey users here's smishing

534
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
here's the things that you need to know

535
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,400
about and so now we're identifying these

536
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
human risks risk related to technology

537
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
that we maybe have in place

538
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
we're seeing it on our logs and our

539
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,679
trends and all these other things but

540
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,760
now we're taking action we're saying

541
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
before this gets out of hand we're

542
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,720
giving you training and we're talking to

543
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,480
you especially the ones that are getting

544
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
the most frequent

545
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,960
fishing attempts

546
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
then you have long term so the

547
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,799
leaderships believes in invested in the

548
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,880
long-term support

549
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,679
again leadership buy-in is key here

550
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,200
recently had a meeting called a

551
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,400
management review if any of you have a

552
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,840
isms in place from iso 27001 management

553
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
review is key here

554
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
so management review you sit down you

555
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,440
look at everything that's happening in

556
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
your program

557
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
that's where you get your management

558
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
buy-in we had a very great conversation

559
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
around what's going on within our

560
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
program in particular what's going on

561
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
with our human rights and they really

562
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
were invested in the conversation what

563
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,840
can we do to fix the human risk what can

564
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,160
we do to resolve this situation

565
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,520
they're demonstrating they're very

566
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
bought in through the actions that

567
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,200
they're doing

568
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
staffing

569
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
all right so i think we said we only

570
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,240
have one person that's

571
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
in here and the rest of you are kind of

572
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,720
part-time

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
the newsletter out or a couple hours

574
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,000
annually

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
stage two you have a part-time person

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
here so

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,919
i get to it when i get to it type

578
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
attitude or maybe you have other

579
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,159
responsibilities

580
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,400
stage three you have a program lead

581
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,960
dedicated to the program i haven't seen

582
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
many people other than one in here that

583
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
have a program lead assigned to it a lot

584
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
of organizations struggle with this

585
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,760
because as we all know you wear a lot of

586
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
hats you have a lot of things that you

587
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
have to do and just getting that buy-in

588
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,679
has always been really challenging

589
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,960
then for stage four you have multiple

590
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
ftes i've never seen that personally and

591
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
if you have i'd be curious as your

592
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
thoughts there but stage four you have

593
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,159
multiple full-time employees assisting

594
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,320
with this

595
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,760
then finally metrics so for metrics

596
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,200
stage one again you're not doing

597
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
anything stage two number of users

598
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,159
signing your acceptable use policy or

599
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,000
other governance or maybe number of

600
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,159
users completing the annual training

601
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,400
promoting awareness stage three you're

602
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
measuring that human risk and you're

603
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,559
measuring fishing exercises so maybe

604
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
you've implemented a tool and you're

605
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,520
able to see

606
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
who's your biggest defenders and you're

607
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
having them doing repeat training and

608
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
that's going up to the to your risk

609
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
management committee or

610
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,760
whoever long term you have a program

611
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,840
lead actively updating leadership

612
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,320
monthly so remember leadership's really

613
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
bought into the program and now you're

614
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
giving them those metrics to support

615
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,440
what you're doing

616
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,760
then we have stage five so metrics are

617
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,640
collected and they're often automated

618
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,760
so

619
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
now you're not having to do anything for

620
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,480
them there's kind of generating on

621
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,520
themselves

622
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,360
and then the metrics are integrated into

623
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
your security frameworks so

624
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
everything that you're doing

625
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
within your security program you have

626
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
these metrics integrated and you're

627
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,799
understanding how they're impacting your

628
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,720
security awareness your human risk

629
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
whatever you're trying to measure

630
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
so now we did all that work you sat down

631
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,360
you had your interviews you recorded

632
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,919
your answers you understand where your

633
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,919
maturity is what do you do all with all

634
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,400
that information well this is what you

635
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,360
do

636
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,679
you develop a roadmap to your desired

637
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,360
maturity level so let's say that you are

638
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,240
a

639
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,880
stage two you only do the compliance

640
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,760
things

641
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
well maybe you're going to develop your

642
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,080
roadmap to stage three and fun fact that

643
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,600
sans

644
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,919
infographic that i showed you guys has

645
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,039
steps to get to the next

646
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,880
again you can go to that document and

647
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,600
it'll give you a little bit of insight

648
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,720
determine your budget if you need one so

649
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
if you need a tool to help with your lms

650
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,520
maybe you have been manually doing your

651
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
security awareness training and that's

652
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,919
no longer sufficient and it pans out in

653
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
the results so

654
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,080
you determine your budget

655
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,320
maybe you just say we need some sort of

656
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,919
tool and you do a little bit of research

657
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,360
here

658
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,039
next you determine your capacity

659
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,520
requirements for resources so this is a

660
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,880
little bit assumed in the budget but i'm

661
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,240
going to dive in a little bit deeper

662
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
here if you are going to need support

663
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
with outside departments maybe hr maybe

664
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,320
compliance maybe whoever as part of the

665
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
project planning you really should

666
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,360
identify how many hours do you need from

667
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,760
them do you need like one hour a week

668
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,720
two hours a week a couple hours a year

669
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,080
what is that number that you need

670
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
assistance with them because what you

671
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
don't want to happen which is going to

672
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,559
cause bad relationships is that you

673
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,320
build this whole project plan and you

674
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
assume that they're going to help you

675
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
and you force them to do work that they

676
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,360
weren't prepared for

677
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
so help get prepared show that you're a

678
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
good business partner and just make sure

679
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
that you understand how much time they

680
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,240
can devote to this program

681
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,960
and then most importantly

682
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
management buy-in

683
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
huge one here i will

684
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,039
harp on it 50 million times

685
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,120
management buy-in for anything that you

686
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
do in security is key

687
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
so

688
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,320
i know it's challenging to say but if

689
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,080
you take the management buy-in

690
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
perspective

691
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
compare it against your human risk

692
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,039
if we mature from a level two

693
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,880
to a level three

694
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,919
what does this do to our human risk

695
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,840
does it reduce it by

696
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,720
ten percent and are we returning having

697
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,559
a return on investment of saving a

698
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,120
hundred thousand dollars are we doing

699
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,200
this and it's having an impact so it's

700
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,799
not good enough that you get the plan

701
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,720
together that you say oh we should do

702
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
this you need to demonstrate to

703
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,360
management the return on investment here

704
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,240
in terms of they understand

705
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
so we got through the maturity

706
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,679
assessment there's tons of things there

707
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,080
lots and lots and lots of steps

708
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,919
but let's walk through one and this is

709
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,760
super super quick exercise because i

710
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,640
think i only have five minutes all right

711
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,080
do any of you guys watch the office

712
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,400
great that's my favorite shows i'm glad

713
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,080
you guys watched that one

714
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,720
all right so dundler dunder mifflin

715
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
mifflin with michael scott

716
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
they have governance

717
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,760
but a policy only addresses

718
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,720
their iso 27001 requirements

719
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
they have execution trainings once a

720
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,600
year that's all they do leadership is

721
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,640
minimally bought in so michael's like

722
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,480
yeah you just do the thing i don't know

723
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,760
what you're talking about but yeah go

724
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,200
ahead and do it

725
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
users sign an information security

726
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,679
policy an acceptable use policy so

727
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,440
you have them doing that

728
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,159
you have no dedicated staff

729
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,520
and you're

730
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,440
only contain the results of the annual

731
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,400
training and maybe the policy sign-offs

732
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
so

733
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,480
what do you guys think i rated them as

734
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
based on those

735
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,799
those quick bullets

736
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
you guys are right

737
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
nailed it you got compliance so

738
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,799
it's not as hard as it seems there's a

739
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
lot of like steps and things like that

740
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,600
in there

741
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,320
i promise you resources are online it's

742
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,679
just a matter of kind of pulling it

743
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,840
together and having the time to do it if

744
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,279
you are trying to figure out how much

745
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,440
time you need to dedicate to this if

746
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,600
you're very familiar with your program

747
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,120
and how it operates you could probably

748
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,200
dedicate five hours of time to this it's

749
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
a quick exercise but you have to make

750
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
sure that you have people bought in to

751
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
interview interview with you and have

752
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,360
the dialogues

753
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
and that is it

754
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,640
um i have um

755
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
twitter linkedin and you guys can

756
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,039
contact me through email if you need any

757
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,960
sort of support or assistance or

758
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,840
understanding you know how to really get

759
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
started more than what's contained in

760
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,200
here so with that any questions

761
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
oh i do have something to give away so

762
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,600
whoever does have a question

763
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
what is this

764
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
a lock pick kit

765
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,720
in the back

766
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,840
presentation software it's prezi

767
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,840
prezi

768
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,559
so it's it's mixed it depends what

769
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,039
you're trying to accomplish so if we're

770
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,520
talking for security awareness

771
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
you can make a case like all right so

772
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,279
you're managing

773
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,159
30 risk on your register relating to

774
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,799
some sort of human activities happening

775
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
tie that in there and how much time

776
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
resources to be able to work on those

777
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
risks so so you have those 30 and for

778
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
each of those risks they're having to

779
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,919
spend five hours of

780
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,919
execution doing whatever those things

781
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,320
are and then you're at 100 hours 30 risk

782
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
um

783
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
and bring that to management so they're

784
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
understanding but additionally if you

785
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,399
are using a compliance framework

786
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
leverage that as well so i'll go back to

787
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,399
the iso

788
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,520
27001 example

789
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,919
a big component there is non-deformities

790
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,679
against your isms

791
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,520
so if

792
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
you do a production process and you

793
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,240
don't

794
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,840
root cause analysis

795
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,200
you're not going to meet the intentions

796
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
of that so if you have an audit coming

797
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,200
up and you have multiple

798
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
non-conformities for something related

799
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
back to security awareness honors

800
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
running your isms in the way you should

801
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,559
because you're not following your

802
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,480
corrective action process

803
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
that's another way that you can do it

804
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,679
the management's not going to want you

805
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,440
to lose that certification if you're not

806
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,039
able to stick to your processes but you

807
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,640
gotta tee up the language just right for

808
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,600
them

809
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,039
not sure if that fully answers your

810
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
question but

811
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,039
all right um i do think i'm at time

812
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,200
oh

813
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,918
yes uh

814
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
um

815
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,720
so is your question having people taking

816
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,320
training around email security

817
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,480
yeah it's a half and half so you should

818
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,799
be enabling your infrastructure to have

819
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,720
those technology components that you

820
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,559
know is preventing it in the first place

821
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,559
but you also want to be able to have

822
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
them doing the things that they

823
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
need to do to keep the environment

824
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,919
secure because ultimately what it boils

825
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,039
down to is you're trying to keep the

826
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,799
information secure within that

827
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,360
environment by reducing that human risk

828
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,399
um

829
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,080
my thoughts was security awareness and

830
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,600
we don't really dig into it as part of

831
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
this presentation i don't like

832
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,360
traditional security awareness trainings

833
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
i think they are horrible they're not

834
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,080
the right thing for our users the right

835
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
thing for the users

836
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,440
identify what kind of training works for

837
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,840
them do your users do better within

838
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,080
person do they do better with videos do

839
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
they do better with whatever and figure

840
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
that out because that sort of training

841
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
is what's going to help reduce that

842
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,080
human rights you understand what kind of

843
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,840
training they need and you're making

844
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,279
sure that they're getting it obviously

845
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,679
like it's more complex with the larger

846
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,519
organizations that you have but if you

847
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,880
have a smaller environment and you're

848
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
able to support that i love having

849
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
one-on-one conversations with our

850
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,000
employees that maybe don't understand

851
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,919
security and now they're getting to know

852
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,240
me rose and security and being able to

853
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,480
tie security back to the things that

854
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,559
they need to do and you foster really

855
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,320
great relationships that way but i

856
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
absolutely don't think we should be

857
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
torturing people with the security

858
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
awareness training that is available we

859
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,679
should be making sure that our

860
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
technology supports them doing their

861
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,600
jobs

862
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,080
any other questions

863
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,399
it will be
