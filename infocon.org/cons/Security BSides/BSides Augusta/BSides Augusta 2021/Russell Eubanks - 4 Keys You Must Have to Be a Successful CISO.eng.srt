area it's just so exciting on everything

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,800
it's just like

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
the investment would go up i knew the

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
impact at cyber in this area is going up

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
but it's just blowing mind blowing

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
it's a delight talk about this and so

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
the thing i want to talk about is some

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,280
keys to be a successful chief

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,719
information security officer i've been a

19
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
privilege to have that role in many

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
different organizations and what i want

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
to do is talk about some of those keys

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
for in particular to help you understand

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
some areas that might be neglected if

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
you're not careful with respect to

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,280
leading

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,000
people that lead people that do cyber

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,119
security things and so that's the

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,240
purpose of this talk is anybody here

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,759
already a cso anybody done or senior

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,320
security leader a couple of yep so

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,560
so yeah so good to see that and i think

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
that that's really key is to whether

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,479
you're interested in that or not or you

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,920
want to understand what's going on in

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
the mind someone who leads to cyber this

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
is

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,840
you

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
my goal is i wanted to think about the

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,119
me several years ago a long time ago and

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,680
in fact 11 years ago decided that i

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
wanted to be a

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
chief information security officer

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
but i wasn't ready i remember when i

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
applied for that first job

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,479
and i didn't even get an interview and i

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
thought well i've been in cyber for a

47
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
while i've done some things i've

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,280
done all the things that i knew to do

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,639
and it's a good reason that company

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,560
didn't hire me or promote me into that

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,239
role because there's all kinds of things

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
i didn't know that i didn't know to be

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
successful so my goal for this time

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
together is to share some things that

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
i've learned with the hopes that

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
at a minimum you don't have to learn

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
these things as well and so that's what

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
i wanted to focus on with this

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
conversation

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,599
and to do that i want to go back in time

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,680
like a long time ago 25 years ago

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
while this is not i didn't have a cell

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760
phone 25 years ago 25 years ago the job

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319

65
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,280

in the community that i was living in i

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
thought i had arrived when i had that

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
job and after doing that uh

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
to two people one person works on one

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
side of the machine that kind of puts

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
them in the

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,280
500 tons worth of force and out the

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
other side it's bended or it has a hole

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
in it or you know things to afford the

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
progress of making stoves i was on the

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
receiving end

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
and so the person on the giving to me

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,560
end he had been there for 30 years

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
for 30 years he would take it put it

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
there the machine would come down and

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
hand it off to someone and that someone

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
case was me

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,359
and i said to myself you know

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
i could do this it's a good paying job

98
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,680
great benefit all nothing wrong with the

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
job i was doing i decided that wearing

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
steel-toed shoes long sleeve shirts

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
protective gear all the things because

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
of an environment like that i thought to

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
myself

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
self what would it look like if i didn't

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
do that the rest of my professional

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
career

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
that's exactly what i was i had that

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,358
conversation so my shift 4 30 in the

109
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,120
afternoon to three in the morning

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,519
usually six days a week

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,759
i went in early one day

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
and one day went in early and i went to

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,919
talk with hr i said hey hr i remember

114
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,160
during orientation

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
you said that one of the many benefits

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,880
at maytag was that if i go to school

117
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
and correct me if i'm wrong but if i go

118
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
to school you'll pay for it did i get

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,639
that right do i remember from that

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
and as it turns out that's exactly what

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
happened

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
they said you know yes we have that

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
benefit go get a receipt go pay for

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
things bring it back and we'll find a

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
way but what was curious to me is they

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
said this

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
we've never had anybody from the plant

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
doing you know manufacturing work to

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
ever do this so they said they were

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
honest they were transparent they said

131
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,479
no one's ever done that before we'll go

132
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
figure it out while you go and pay and

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
bring back the receipts and we'll make

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,520
it all right and they did make it all

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,758
right

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
this hunch i had this idea i had i think

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,479
i want to do something else really led

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,880
me to the place that i'm at today and

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,600
that idea of what is it like to want

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
more what is it like to want to do more

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,280
so

142
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
whether you're a cso

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
whether you want to be a cso someday or

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
you may very well wonder what rattles in

145
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
the mind of someone who leads people

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,199
that leads people that does cyber

147
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
security this is the talk for you and

148
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
again i want to share four key areas of

149
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
what that looks like and what that looks

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
like to go think about

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
what is success

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
what is the when

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,639
how do i know when i find it how do i

154
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,400
know when i get there

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,280
what's so funny at my last full-time job

156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
i was privileged to lead the security

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
function for the federal reserve bank of

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,600
atlanta atlanta's home for me i always

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
come to b-sides augustine from atlanta

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
but uh because of remembering where i

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
used to work

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
and the things i used to do

163
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
and

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
it's a good job it just didn't allow me

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
to do things i wanted to do

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
when i walked in the halls very big very

167
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
nice very prominent halls of the federal

168
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,680
reserve bank of atlanta and all the

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
places i've worked ever since

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
you know typically in the morning on

171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
monday someone will say

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
how you doing

173
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
it's monday oh god it's monday all the

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
things you've said that i've said that

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
you hear that and it's become kind of

176
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
normal

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
but when people would ask me that

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,880
question when they would say

179
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
russell it's monday it's eight o'clock

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,720
in the morning

181
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
well i wish we had another long day

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
weekend i got to recover from all the

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,520
things that over the weekend and i get

184
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,599
that i understand that i respect that

185
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
but when they would look at me and they

186
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
would say how are you doing

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,479
i would always have the very same answer

188
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,720
and people would laugh at me

189
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,199
and i'm okay with that

190
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,479
but they would say how are you and i

191
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
would say i'm living the dream

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,120
and why would i say that

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
because just a couple of slides ago i

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,360
showed just a little glimpse into the er

195
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,919
when i frankly wasn't living the dream

196
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,639
25 years ago my story was not standing

197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,479
in here and talking about these things

198
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
25 years ago it was

199
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,759
sweat hot no air conditioner

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
for me very unsafe environment could be

201
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
hurt or injured at any time because of

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
the working conditions and i thought to

203
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
myself not living the dream at all so

204
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,400
when people say how are you doing i can

205
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
i'm old enough to remember to be able to

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
go back in time and recall what that

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,039
looks like and so what i realized to get

208
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
that transition from where i was to

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
where i'm privileged to be at today the

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
place where i'm literally living the

211
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,199
dream it took four things

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
what are the four things they just

213
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,199
let her see it wasn't my intention just

214
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
kind of played out that way and i want

215
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
to walk you through that journey of

216
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,199
constraints culture clarity and customer

217
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,840
service nothing technical at all

218
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
not one of those things is really

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
technical things but

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
seeing people that lead people that do

221
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,000
cyber security

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
for the most critical things that

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
perhaps could be done and so

224
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
let's talk about the first one

225
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,319
the first one is constraints

226
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,199
what constraints are necessary for

227
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
someone to be and serve as a successful

228
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,080
chief information security officer

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
in this case it's a gate kind of keep

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
out restricted what are some constraints

231
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,360
what are some things that someone to be

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,399
a successful

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
cyber security leader does not need to

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,599
have

235
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,720
perhaps

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
if you're like me i started at the

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
lowest of the low on the org chart in

238
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,680
cyber and you can work my way up to

239
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,279
different organizations moving

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,200
relocating training certifications all

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,080
the things that we do

242
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,040
but in that journey

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
my job response i had a couple

244
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,959
responsibilities but one of them was to

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,120
be in charge of windows security for a

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
large healthcare company in southeast

247
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
tennessee

248
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
before my first job

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,120
stay at that job i had been entered into

250
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,279
a group domain admins and so i had full

251
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,440
admin privileges which looking back

252
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
maybe wasn't the best idea but that was

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
what was necessary i had that i had to

254
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,880
do those things and i had that access

255
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,600
what did that mean that meant i could

256
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
basically do anything i wanted to from a

257
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
security and configuration perspective

258
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,800
in the domain no one was going to tell

259
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
me no i had all the rights all the

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
permissions

261
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
but as i started to move up into my

262
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
journey of leadership you know team

263
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
leader manager supervisor all the things

264
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,519
like that

265
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
the need for me to maintain and keep

266
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
that access

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
dwindled like pretty fast

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
and while i've been to school i've had

269
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
the training i've learned and i was

270
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
pretty proficient after several years of

271
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
doing that at administering a domain

272
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
my job at the time did not require that

273
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
i started to move up the organization i

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,760
needed less and less administrative

275
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
access to do my job because my job

276
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,000
wasn't always hands on keyboard

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
playing around with group policy

278
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,800
there are some places what are some

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,399
areas where

280
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
even though maybe in an approval process

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
oftentimes the security leaders will say

282
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
yes you can be in that group or yes you

283
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,000
can do that thing or yes you can

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
interpret the policy that way just

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,880
because you can doesn't necessarily mean

286
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,279
that you could again that idea of what

287
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,120
are some constraints and so there goes

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
this because you can doesn't mean you

289
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
could got some big thumbs up there yeah

290
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
from a fellow see so yeah that's exactly

291
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
right just because you can doesn't mean

292
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,279
you should

293
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,040
uh and what might that look like

294
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
when i had uh

295
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,079
five and a half six and a half seven

296
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,079
half years ago when i started at my last

297
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,680
full-time job

298
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
i was really excited about coming in and

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
proving to the organization that they've

300
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,959
made a good hiring decision

301
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,480
i want to come in and impress them give

302
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
them some ideas ooh never thought of it

303
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
that way we're so glad you're here good

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
job we're so glad that you're here

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
russell that was my

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
tell anybody that before telling you

307
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,880
here right now but that was my goal when

308
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
i started

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,360
my most previous full-time job

310
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
so i want to come in and make a big

311
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
impact

312
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
and his life would happen wouldn't you

313
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,760
know it a couple of weeks into my tenure

314
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
back in 2015

315
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,920
there was a security incident

316
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,519
and a lot of the work that i've done in

317
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
the past is around instant response

318
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,600
building teams responding recovering all

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
the work that comes uh with that and

320
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
you've done that work you know typically

321
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
you know five o'clock on a friday uh

322
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
before a long weekend you get a call and

323
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,000
it kind of ruins your plans that's been

324
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
an area that i wouldn't

325
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,880
quite

326
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
blood they didn't mean much verbal

335
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,560
resistance but

336
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,959
i don't know

337
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
heard the words no hard no don't do that

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,040
went in

339
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,680
low severity worked through it brief did

340
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,240
the things coordinated do this do that

341
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
here's the report here's the re all the

342
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,639
stuff it worked out just fine

343
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,240
but i'll never forget about that that

344
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
was back in 2015 i'll never forget that

345
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,680
because

346
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,519
i made a mistake

347
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,200
the chief of the instant handling team

348
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
shouldn't have had to say to the chief

349
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
information security officer no russell

350
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
it's my job to lead the team that

351
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,880
responds to incidents no russell it's

352
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,959
not you don't even have access to all

353
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,800
these

354
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,399
you're still the fng

355
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,639
there's something better for you to do

356
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,600
whatever that thing is

357
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
what constraints are necessary

358
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
because our time is limited

359
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,839
how can we best spend our time again

360
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
looking at constraints there might be a

361
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
way to think about that

362
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,079
oops

363
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
again in access and access control

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
are there certain groups

365
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
certain meetings certain things that

366
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,680
we've accumulated over time and maybe

367
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
you've seen that i've certainly seen

368
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
that as the longer you're at an

369
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
organization you're longer your tenure

370
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
the more likely that you have like a

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
whole bunch of groups and projects and

372
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
sharepoints and all the access that you

373
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,639
have

374
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
that you might have needed in the past

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,760
but perhaps you don't need right now

376
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
what would it look like

377
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
if there was a process a calendar

378
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
reminder a recurring

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
nudge that says does russell still need

380
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
to be a domain admin does russell still

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
need to go to that meeting does russell

382
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,800
still in service of trying to be in

383
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,279
earnest a successful chief information

384
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,839
security officer does he still need

385
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,360
the things that he has the group

386
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
memberships etc what would it look like

387
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
to revisit that to prune that up and

388
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,560
think about what are the examples what

389
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
are the places where perhaps we've

390
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
accumulated too much access control

391
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
again constraints what's another

392
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,000
constraint something that you can

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
inflict upon yourself that can free you

394
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
up to do the things

395
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
that only you can do

396
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
another constraint might be in money

397
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
a lot of times i've been guilty of maybe

398
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
you've heard as well maybe you've said

399
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,360
as well you know what if my blankety

400
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
blank boss would only give me another

401
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
million dollars i could buy fill in the

402
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,839
blank and then i could solve all the

403
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
cyber security problems at the company

404
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
i'm privileged to work at

405
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,079
and say that

406
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,800
and in complete transparency i've said

407
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,959
that before

408
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,800
you know the reason i can't do that is i

409
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
don't have any money the reason i can't

410
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
do that is my splunk license only goes

411
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,360
so far or my visibility is not what it

412
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
should be

413
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
and i think while it's easy to do that

414
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
it's easy to say i've got the constraint

415
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,760
of i don't have enough money

416
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
maybe there's some things that we can do

417
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
maybe there's a way where the constraint

418
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
might actually be able to show some new

419
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
creativity or show a new possibility

420
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
that if you had money if you had the

421
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,399
license if you had the things that you

422
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,839
say that are standing in the way

423
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
maybe there's another way to do that

424
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
back in 2011

425
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
i was working on a project

426
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,399
and i became very excited the

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,920
security control right maybe you've

428
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,519
heard of them center for internet

429
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,639
security

430
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
they just give away a list of

431
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,240
prioritized things to do that when you

432
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
do them according to a lot of

433
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
organizations u.s federal government

434
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,119
other international

435
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,040
approach to say when you do these things

436
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,199
not only do you get your pretty

437
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,399
just

438
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
for a lot of us

439
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,320
but you also literally reduce the

440
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
probability of a breach

441
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
when i do these things i'm not just busy

442
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,639
doing things that are mapped to

443
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,440
compliance mapped to visibility a lot of

444
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
automation and got me really excited

445
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,720
about that

446
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
when i heard about that again i heard

447
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,759
about it first i think 2008

448
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,279
started to think well what would that

449
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,240
look like

450
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,839
they had examples where the u.s

451
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,519
department of state

452
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
like that department of state with

453
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,199
people in every time zone around the

454
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,279
world on a sensitive but unclassified

455
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,040
network in the very first year

456
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,519
reduced their vulnerabilities by 85

457
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,279
percent

458
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
so i looked in the mirror like i'm not

459
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,800
shaving brushing my teeth all the things

460
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
we do in the morning i looked in the

461
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
mirror and i said self

462
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,959
what am i doing that has results like

463
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,919
that

464
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
what am i doing that could show that i'm

465
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
doing whatever initiative things i'm

466
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,400
working on leading doing what am i doing

467
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
to

468
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,720
and

469
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
pretty quickly it struck me

470
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,559
like nothing no no project working on

471
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
have ever had that type of

472
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,000
with math and metrics and reporting to

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
show a reduction in well much of

474
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,039
anything especially at that scale i was

475
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
excited about what they did

476
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
they were giving out charts and reports

477
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
and templates here's how they did it and

478
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
very nice of them to do that for the

479
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
community at the time i was excited

480
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
about

481
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,160
it but i was the security team

482
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
at that time i was working to build a

483
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
security function for a healthcare

484
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
startup they didn't have a security

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
person i went from a big team to being

486
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
the team

487
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
i was excited about doing that i just

488
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,760
didn't have a way to make it happen no

489
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
more funding no more budget you know

490
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,679
just it was good we got a security part

491
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,200
just be glad that you're here because

492
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
before there was no security person i

493
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
was excited about that but the

494
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,640
constraint of a lack of funding

495
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
i thought well

496
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
about that what are some things that i

497
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
can do

498
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
so i decided to read the find manual

499
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,960
i had some security tools

500
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,559
those are in place but i knew i couldn't

501
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,760
get any more

502
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
i thought well when i look at what state

503
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
did what would it look like if i decided

504
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,559
to

505
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,720
lean in metaphorically to the tools that

506
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,640
i had to see is perhaps there's some

507
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
undocumented features perhaps there's

508
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
some capabilities in those tools that

509
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,120
could get me a little bit closer to the

510
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,679
results of what state had

511
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,760
and that's exactly what i did

512
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,480
this idea of the constraint because i

513
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
didn't have a support i didn't have the

514
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,840
money didn't have the funding but i was

515
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
inspired by the work that someone else

516
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
did was able to literally write the

517
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
first paper uh give a presentation here

518
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,360
at besides august actually a long time

519
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,400
ago around what would it look like

520
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
to solve for those controls without

521
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,000
having to spend any money

522
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
so that constraint

523
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
allowed the creativity

524
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,919
it's just an example there's plenty of

525
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,280
examples

526
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
but one example of i'm inspired to do

527
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,559
that and not stopping with and i can

528
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
only do it if i have whatever money

529
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
state had to solve that same problem why

530
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,440
do i say that

531
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
because i want you to think about some

532
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
areas where

533
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
maybe you're saying if i only had three

534
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
more people

535
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
if i had a managed service provider if i

536
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,919
had someone watching the alarms if only

537
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
i had these things

538
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,880
then i could solve that problem

539
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,520
so think about one

540
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
and think about what would it look like

541
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
to creatively solve that problem if you

542
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,760
don't have enough money you know what we

543
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
never have enough money what are some

544
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
ways that we can lean in and solve for

545
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
problems just like that

546
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
what was interesting is

547
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
gave that talk my first ever talk was at

548
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,159
b-sides atlanta

549
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,520
back when b-size atlanta used to be a

550
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
whole really big deal like way bigger

551
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,280
than augusta interesting how it's turned

552
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
around

553
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,280
i gave a talk on how to do that

554
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,080
and to my most two most recent folks who

555
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
hired me for a full-time job i wasn't

556
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
looking they were looking they came in

557
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,080
and heard a way to approach that and

558
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
actually got my last two full-time jobs

559
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
as a result of doing just that

560
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
there's a constraint where

561
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
to find creativity to solve those

562
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
particular problems

563
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
so it does work it was out of necessity

564
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,240
wasn't that for a job

565
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,919
hunting and looking for the next job but

566
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,200
interesting how

567
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,640
life works sometimes

568
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,919
the second c i'd love to share right now

569
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,799
is around culture

570
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
culture

571
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
a lot of times especially as leaders or

572
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,240
aspiring leaders you must ask yourself a

573
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
question

574
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,880
is this something that only i can do

575
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
remember that instant response thing i

576
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,159
talked about earlier on the previously

577
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
is this something that only i can do at

578
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,159
my last full-time job so a minute i live

579
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,600
in atlanta there's like six and a half

580
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,440
million people in atlanta traffic is

581
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
nasty awful horrible um of course

582
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,440
pre-paid doing

583
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,159
my commute to go 25 miles was a minimum

584
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,799
of 45 minutes each way

585
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,039
and usually longer on the way home so i

586
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,679
get up early go to work get there early

587
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
russell how you doing living the dream a

588
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,840
minute sincerely and i tried my best to

589
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
leave at a decent time to not be stuck

590
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,360
in just terrible traffic if you've been

591
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
stuck in land traffic

592
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
i'm sorry

593
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,799
45 minutes i'd listen to podcasts i do

594
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,799
the things i call my parents call my

595
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
brother call my k all the things to kind

596
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,039
of have an agenda for sitting in my car

597
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,600
sometimes moving many times not moving

598
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,679
but one of the things i did

599
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
every single time all the way to work

600
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,240
is mentally i would say what are some

601
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,640
things that i only i can do i'd ask

602
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,799
myself that question i'd assign myself

603
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
that task

604
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
what are three things russell that only

605
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,480
you can do

606
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
and on the way home which was always a

607
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
much longer trip i would

608
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,039
ask myself of those three things

609
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,720
did you do those three things those

610
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
three things that only you can do and by

611
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,760
saying that i'm not saying that i'm

612
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,559
better than anybody at all in any form

613
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,559
or fashion don't hear that

614
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,159
but because of the position the

615
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
responsibility the role that i had as

616
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,919
chief information security officer i

617
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
wanted to recognize that there's some

618
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,159
things that only i could do maybe it was

619
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
approve a policy or approve an exception

620
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,919
or brief a board or whatever it might be

621
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,480
so that those that are doing the things

622
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,559
to stop bad things from happening can

623
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,320
have their time freed up to do what they

624
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,480
do the best what are things that only i

625
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
can do and if on the way home when i

626
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
asked myself is how would i do those i'd

627
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
reach around good job did it one two

628
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
three yes

629
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,559
and if i didn't

630
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,159
i'd hold myself accountable on the way

631
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,919
to work the next day

632
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,840
maybe i'd have four things or five

633
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,919
things or six things

634
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,000
of what are some things that only i can

635
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
do maybe it's small things maybe it's

636
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
canceling a meeting it's so many things

637
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
but in a leadership position

638
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,400
what are

639
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,720
some things that only you can do

640
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,520
for me what i've seen success i've had

641
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
at leading large and small and

642
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
medium-sized security teams

643
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,640
culture

644
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,480
is

645
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
well everything

646
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,919
what would it look like if your

647
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,840
colleagues if those that you were

648
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
privileged to lead

649
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
when they walked into the building are

650
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
they logged into zoom or teams or

651
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,279
however you're working in this

652
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,039
environment right now

653
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,360
what if when they were asked how are you

654
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
doing what if they were to say

655
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,279
you know

656
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,840
i'm living the

657
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,159
dream i know my purpose i know my

658
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,880
passion and i'm doing things that align

659
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
uh where my person my

660
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,559
passion and purpose exist i'm doing

661
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,240
those things as much as possible i'm not

662
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,600
doing the things that i hate to do i'm

663
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
not working in a factory i'm not

664
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,679
delivering pizza i'm not whatever the

665
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
things that they were doing what would

666
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
it look like if you could create and

667
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,559
design

668
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,039
intentionally as a leader a culture

669
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
where things like that would be said by

670
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
those that you're privileged

671
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
to leave what would that look like just

672
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
imagine again about what are some things

673
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
that only

674
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,679
you

675
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,279
as a successful cso can do

676
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,640
this one always makes me smile an

677
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,080
example uh would be

678
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,080
i called it it's not a very creative

679
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,679
name you leave it if you can think of a

680
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
more creative name let me know i'll

681
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,799
change it but i always call it the

682
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,240
cafeteria test

683
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
no creativity in the name but this idea

684
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,760
that you know if you work a nine-to-five

685
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,360
job or whatever your time is at some

686
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,679
point at larger organizations maybe

687
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,960
there's a cafeteria you can go in and

688
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,919
get lunch uh and i can just in my mind i

689
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,080
can just see cafeteria lines of places

690
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
i've worked at in the past you get your

691
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,279
tray you kind of walk around well i'm

692
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,799
going to get a burger i'm going to get a

693
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
hot dog i'm going to get a salad i'll

694
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
eat healthy today i'll get a smoothie

695
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,760
what all the options are

696
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,039
but since you've got to go there anyway

697
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,159
since you should go there anyway

698
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,159
as you get your tray

699
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,080
and as you walking around deciding what

700
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
to get

701
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,039
what if you go

702
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,240
on a mission

703
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,720
what if you again assign yourself some

704
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
work as you're carrying your tray around

705
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,799
what if you look around and you see

706
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
people who are already there they've

707
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
already made their choice of the things

708
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
that they're going to get in you

709
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
and you see there they are

710
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,799
you don't say anything just kind of

711
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
watch

712
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
and then you count maybe you walk

713
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
towards them a little bit not in a

714
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,080
creepy way

715
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
but you get near them and then they lock

716
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,799
eyes

717
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,600
the second that happens not a word is

718
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,679
said that little micro second right

719
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,640
there

720
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
when they that those eyes are locked and

721
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,480
they see you

722
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,120
what do they do

723
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,520
when they see you

724
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,039
is it

725
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,720
i think i'd rather leave i don't want a

726
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,559
pizza there's no way there's that

727
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,919
security guy coming there's that

728
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,600
security girl coming and that's not good

729
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,439
or again when you lock eyes

730
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,480
there's russell he fixed my problem

731
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
whether him or his team or the team he's

732
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,679
previously

733
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,679
what if you did that cafeteria test like

734
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,760
two or three people not creepy not goofy

735
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,279
i don't want you to go to hr and get in

736
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
trouble

737
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,799
but what if you

738
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,960
went to places where your co-workers are

739
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,880
at and

740
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,559
cafeteria ted or something like that to

741
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,760
say

742
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
how's that engagement maybe do it

743
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,080
another time maybe do it another time

744
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
i did that

745
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,039
for seven months

746
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,919
and what i found was i got non-verbal

747
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,840
feedback

748
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
if there was tension

749
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,720
if there was happiness if there was

750
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,120
there's a blanket blanket security

751
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,679
people team again whether it's about me

752
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,279
or the team that i'm privileged to leave

753
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,880
didn't really matter i wanted to see how

754
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
we're showing up how are we offering and

755
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,120
adding value to those that we're working

756
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,840
with

757
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
i've never been

758
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,919
working at an organization that existed

759
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,640
because of cyber security

760
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
i've been at places where companies make

761
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
things and do things and serve things

762
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,039
and cyber is a way to reduce the risk

763
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,480
and them doing that particular function

764
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,360
so

765
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,440
i've never worked in a place where the

766
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
reason we work here is cyber

767
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,440
but that's probably a good thing because

768
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
i get to help tailor and craft the

769
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
culture such that when there's

770
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
encounters at the cafeteria at the

771
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,960
entrance at the exit at the parking

772
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,000
garage

773
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
where possible i want them to be better

774
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
feeling better off than now that when

775
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
they before they first engaged with us

776
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,080
or specifically with me

777
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,240
did that for seven months i gave an

778
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,159
assignment to those that was were a

779
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,840
direct report to me

780
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,399
uh in the org chart and said look as a

781
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
leadership team i've tried this i'm

782
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,320
gonna do this and i want you to do the

783
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,640
same thing

784
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
why did i want them to do that

785
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,799
i wanted them to feel that tension i

786
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,320
wanted them to be more aware of how they

787
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,159
were showing up and how those that they

788
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,399
were privileged to lead were interacting

789
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,000
with folks who

790
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
out doing their things in common areas

791
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,679
and feel that

792
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,679
and then where possible change their

793
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,440
behaviors change their approach to be

794
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,080
able to add more value again

795
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
this tells you how are you showing up

796
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
how's your team showing up and from a

797
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
cultural perspective what are things

798
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
that you can do to better improve or

799
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,200
mold the culture of the team that you're

800
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
privileged to lead to better meet the

801
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,559
needs of your respective organization

802
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
again goofy name cafeteria test it's

803
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,799
been great i've loved it

804
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,480
and it may be a little bit weird until

805
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,159
you get back into or if you do get back

806
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
to an in-person scenario

807
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,240
but maybe you do it

808
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,039
before you go to the next talk

809
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,640
maybe you choose to do that today

810
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
just something to think about

811
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,919
i talked about earlier walking the halls

812
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,840
again looking at the culture

813
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
i told earlier that idea of walking in

814
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
and russell how are you doing

815
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
again i'm living the dream i can't

816
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,080
imagine doing something other than what

817
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,240
i'm doing now

818
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
it took being bold it took asking

819
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
questions it took frankly me remembering

820
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,120
what my life was like 25 years ago

821
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,520
to be able to say that but walk in the

822
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,000
halls as you walk the halls or as you

823
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
walk the zoom calls right as you walk

824
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,279
the teams or webex or whatever

825
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
technologies you might be using in lieu

826
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,440
of walking the halls

827
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,039
what does that look like to show up in a

828
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,960
way

829
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
what would that look like if you could

830
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,080
talk to the person that recruited me to

831
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
my last full-time job back in 2015 they

832
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
talked to me for a very long time hey

833
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
will you come will you come and take a

834
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,919
decrease in pay will you have a longer

835
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
commute and you have a higher stress

836
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
level job okay they didn't say that but

837
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,600
that's kind of how it works out

838
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,880
sometimes

839
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
if you were to go to the hr recruiter

840
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,080
that recruited me

841
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,720
and you were to say herb

842
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,559
of all the questions russell asked

843
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,880
before saying yes to that offer to go

844
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,440
work and lead a very successful very

845
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
prominent security team at a super

846
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,320
important organization

847
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
what's the key idea what's the number

848
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,039
one type of question

849
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,919
it was that it was culture

850
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
what's it like to work there where i was

851
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,520
working at before in telecommunications

852
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,960
i knew the culture i've been there for a

853
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
while i knew how to navigate how to get

854
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,519
expense reports paid how to

855
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,080
cover for and take care of and

856
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,640
communicate different issues

857
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
but another organization i didn't know

858
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
the culture i wanted to know was i going

859
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,679
to like to be there

860
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,039
would they like for me to be there

861
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,760
those ideas of what's it like to walk

862
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,200
the halls

863
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480
literally or metaphorically

864
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,559
another way to think about culture is in

865
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,880
this idea of

866
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,519
understanding the culture

867
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,600
and then saying what would it look like

868
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,760
to improve the culture

869
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
an idea i like is this idea of

870
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,240
experimentation

871
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,320
culture a lot of times you can think of

872
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,080
organization-wise culture according to

873
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,559
john carter wicked smart

874
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,360
professor author student from harvard

875
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
business school said that culture

876
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,360
changed for large organizations

877
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,760
in his book called leading change three

878
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,640
to ten years

879
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
it's like wow

880
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,840
that's a long time

881
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
i have no idea where i'm gonna be in 10

882
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
years you have no idea if you'll be

883
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
working at the same company in 10 years

884
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,159
so you might think

885
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,360
that's someone else's problem

886
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,640
but what if we thought about culture as

887
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,559
the culture of the team that we're

888
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,799
privileged to lead

889
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,799
maybe we go from i like the whole

890
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,720
company culture to be better

891
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
but maybe i'm going to focus on some

892
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
things that only i can do and that's the

893
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,519
culture of

894
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,760
improving the culture in the teen that

895
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,679
i'm privileged i like this idea of

896
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,120
experiments

897
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,039
what are some experiments let's just say

898
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,120
let's make it safe to try a couple of

899
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,480
ideas

900
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
here's an example of some things that

901
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,320
i've done just against some examples

902
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,760
that you can consider as well

903
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,200
when i was a cio and the iso for a

904
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
financial services organization

905
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,840
had all hands meeting room people

906
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,559
developers help desk security dbas the

907
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,360
whole bit i said you know what what i've

908
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,240
seen on my calendar is but there's a lot

909
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
of recurring meetings there's like

910
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,159
sometimes double triple quadruple book

911
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,320
just like how in the world can people

912
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,919
not see that like i'm busy from three

913
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,960
o'clock

914
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,519
to four o'clock every thursday and no i

915
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,720
i literally can't go to all those

916
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
meetings

917
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,399
so i had an idea i said let's try this

918
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,720
experiment let's try this experiment for

919
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
everybody here in the room

920
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,840
the next time you get a meeting

921
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,480
invite and there's no agenda like

922
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,720
the reason i want you in this meeting is

923
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,399
i want you to talk about this thing and

924
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,320
give us an update

925
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,240
or and it'll only take this time and

926
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,080
then when you're done you can leave if

927
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,840
you want

928
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,120
to the next time you get a meeting

929
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,760
invite and there's no agenda you have my

930
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,159
permission to go in and decline the

931
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,480
meeting

932
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,760
and everybody is like silence what but

933
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,440
you can i see there's a decline button

934
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,799
but i didn't know you could actually use

935
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,640
it in your email calendaring system

936
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,880
and if you feel bad about it

937
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,480
if you're not quite sure

938
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,039
click decline and put a little statement

939
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,440
put these words my boss russell said

940
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,960
that i don't have to go to the meeting

941
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,639
with an agenda done

942
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,960
blame me

943
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,199
it was an experiment i wondered what

944
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,839
would it look like

945
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,440
if

946
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
there was clarity around why do you want

947
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
me to go to that meeting why do i need

948
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
to be there what am i trying to achieve

949
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,320
in that particular meeting

950
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
fun fact

951
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,119
i didn't ask anybody's permission

952
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,040
i didn't go to my boss maybe i should

953
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
have i didn't go to my boss and say hey

954
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
boss here's what i want to do let's have

955
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,280
a committee let's do a study let's do a

956
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
i just said i'm sensing there's a

957
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,119
problem there

958
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,560
i'm sensing maybe you don't like to go

959
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,079
to all these meetings

960
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,960
blame me

961
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
i never got in trouble

962
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,599
i never even told my boss like before

963
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,599
during or after but all of a sudden

964
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,440
there was people going to less meetings

965
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,680
and people under having clarity of the

966
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,160
reason i'm at this meeting is i need to

967
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
give a report on whatever i need to give

968
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
a status whatever i need to do those

969
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,280
particular things

970
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,839
nobody got fired nobody got in trouble

971
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,880
and

972
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
even though i don't know or did it if

973
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
anyone ever said the reason i'm not

974
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
going to this meeting

975
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,359
but nobody ever called me and says why

976
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,320
aren't you people going to meetings

977
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,400
anymore

978
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,640
it's an experiment we made it safe to

979
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
try we did a little time box hey let's

980
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,920
try it for 90.

981
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
let's just see what happens

982
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,240
if we get in and we realize it's not

983
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,160
going to work i'll take the blame

984
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,320
seriously i'll take it away

985
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,720
but what would it look like if we create

986
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,319
an environment in our

987
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
eye then

988
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,560
we're better off

989
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
look at those

990
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,599
i've got ideas a developer

991
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,680
if i were a developer i've got this idea

992
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
and if you're a developer let's go in

993
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
business together we'll be rich together

994
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,760
i've got an idea let's just imagine if

995
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,839
before you scheduled a meeting in

996
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,000
whatever scheduling service that you use

997
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,680
for meetings

998
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
imagine easy math

999
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,839
you've got 10 people and up for easy

1000
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,680
math everyone makes 100 an hour

1001
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,119
what would it look like as you go and

1002
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,040
add those 10 people are the distribution

1003
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
list and you say

1004
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,920
you click

1005
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
button

1006
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,520
it was like a doll that said

1007
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,079
100 times 10 equals what

1008
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,000
so

1009
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,680
let's just say there was a little

1010
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,560
message

1011
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,400
that came up that said

1012
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
are you

1013
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
if you're gonna get

1014
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,359
with the value before you

1015
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,320
you are

1016
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,839


1017
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,960
thousand dollars of value for that one

1018
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,000
people make different money and i made

1019
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,839
easy numbers and

1020
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,400
just math there

1021
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
what would it look like

1022
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,079
if we understood the cost of the things

1023
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,240
that we're doing before we did the

1024
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,320
things that we're doing

1025
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,400
are we getting that much value again let

1026
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,880
me know if you got ways to think making

1027
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
a plug-in like that could make someone

1028
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,240
money

1029
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,640
culture as well how we talk how we think

1030
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,079
i mentioned before living the dream

1031
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,760
i don't care

1032
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,079
i know where i came from i know not that

1033
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,440
long ago

1034
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,920
i was not living the dream

1035
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,520
but other ways to look at language

1036
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,000
isn't it fun sometimes when you do say

1037
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
fishing tests

1038
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,160
and people click on it and it makes it

1039
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,520
fun to say things like users

1040
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
they're the weakest link

1041
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
those users they don't know what they're

1042
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,040
doing they're the weakest that's why

1043
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
that's happening they're just not smart

1044
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,839
enough to use our systems and

1045
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,320
in full disclosure i hated like saying

1046
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,560
that i don't even say that

1047
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
but i wanted to say that

1048
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
because i've said that before and maybe

1049
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
you say that now maybe your team has

1050
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,400
said things like that before if those

1051
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,440
accountants were only smart enough

1052
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,480
i click on those links

1053
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,720
if that dba just had sense about

1054
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
themselves they wouldn't do things

1055
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,960
when we blame others when we have

1056
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,800
someone else

1057
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,880
is so bad is a dba clicked on a link

1058
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,079
all of a sudden it's their fault

1059
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,560
what it looked like if we changed it a

1060
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,520
little bit

1061
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,880
i don't want people clicking on links

1062
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
and you may or may not focus on that i

1063
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,240
know a lot of companies i work with are

1064
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,560
focusing on that

1065
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
but what if you change the narrative

1066
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,440
from users are

1067
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,200
stupid they're dumb they don't have any

1068
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,720
sense they're not smart enough they

1069
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,280
shouldn't have access to the internet

1070
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,320
and what if you change to

1071
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,200
our colleagues

1072
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,240
are the biggest target

1073
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,000
the access our cfo has the access our

1074
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,160
accountants has is so valuable that

1075
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
attacker wants to get their credentials

1076
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,520
and do bad things how can i protect them

1077
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,119
better

1078
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,880
or maybe this question this is a tough

1079
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,200
one too

1080
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,520
ask a question

1081
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,440
after your next fishing exercise or any

1082
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,119
social engineering type of test that you

1083
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
do what if instead of saying it's their

1084
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,839
fault what if you said

1085
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,920
this question

1086
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,359
what was it about my training

1087
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,280
that led the database administrator to

1088
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
say it's okay to click on links in every

1089
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,720
single email that they get

1090
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,399
what was it about my training

1091
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,079
what would it look like if we took some

1092
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,160
responsibility for the language that we

1093
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,119
use

1094
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,920
in ways that we try to do that

1095
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
here's a hack

1096
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,800
anybody know the mission of your

1097
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,200
respective organization

1098
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,960
who

1099
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,760
what's the mission of your company

1100
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,160
beautiful

1101
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,319
crisp clear concise you know why

1102
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,760
we spoke about last night we know

1103
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,920
exactly why you do the things you do the

1104
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
population that you serve when you do

1105
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,880
that and i'm grateful that you do that

1106
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,520
and that you know

1107
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,599
i've never worked in a place that was in

1108
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,000
security alone

1109
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
what if i

1110
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,079
monday morning so i'm giving you some

1111
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,520
homework because i think about

1112
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
monday when you go log in however you

1113
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,680
log in or show up however you show up at

1114
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,640
your respective

1115
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,359
if you spend

1116
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,119
i don't know the mission

1117
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,280
of

1118
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,800
my

1119
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,480
calendar

1120
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,079
an appointment

1121
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,359
for five minutes

1122
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,440
what would it look like if

1123
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
i was able to quote

1124
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,520
the mission of my company

1125
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,839
an example that i can i can't remember

1126
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,200
all the words i wish i could but i can't

1127
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,800
but i'll use an example of the american

1128
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
red cross the american red cross to

1129
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,119
serve the most vulnerable let's just

1130
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
imagine that monday morning we all wake

1131
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,720
up and we're all the chief information

1132
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,240
security officer for the american red

1133
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,839
cross whose mission is

1134
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,599
to serve the most vulnerable

1135
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,280
what would it look like

1136
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
if when we logged in on tuesday the next

1137
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,240
day after we discovered the mission at

1138
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,000
the american red cross with all being

1139
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,240
chief information security officer there

1140
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,400
what would it look like if

1141
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,119
every action that we took

1142
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,920
we would say these words the reason i'm

1143
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,599
going to this meeting is

1144
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,240
to serve the most vulnerable what if the

1145
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,000
person who's leading the chief of the

1146
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
incident handling team if they said the

1147
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,839
reason i'm the chief of the incident

1148
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,720
handling team is

1149
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,800
i'm going to serve the most vulnerable

1150
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,960
the reason why our security team has a

1151
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,040
strategy for the next three years is

1152
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,119
i'm gonna serve i want to leave people

1153
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,040
that lead people that

1154
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
serve the most vulnerable what would it

1155
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,599
look like if you intentionally change

1156
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,079
the culture of your security from we're

1157
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,800
smart we're lead we can apt and we can

1158
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
dlp and all the acronyms that we can

1159
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,040
acronym

1160
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,520
there's value there

1161
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,960
i'm not dismissing the things you've

1162
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,319
learned and the capabilities that you

1163
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,160
have and the ambitions

1164
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,560
that you aspire to have

1165
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,480
whether it's be a cso or understand to

1166
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,640
see so better

1167
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,800
but what if as a leader

1168
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200
you changed the culture to such places

1169
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,680
where oh well forgot it

1170
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,760
that you were able to

1171
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,920
align and support your team in that way

1172
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,960
what if

1173
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,880
january 2 of next year if that's the

1174
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,000
first day your team comes in to work

1175
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,599
what if they knew

1176
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,240
and had in their job description and had

1177
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,319
in their performance objectives the

1178
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,240
reason i'm the chief of instant handling

1179
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,480
team is

1180
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,319
the mission of your company the reason

1181
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,480
i'm scanning all my systems every day

1182
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,119
all the time is

1183
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,200
the mission of your respective

1184
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,640
organization

1185
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,359
so

1186
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,480
uh mission for knowing so

1187
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,960
since you know the mission

1188
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,920
you

1189
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,280
well deserve thank you for that

1190
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,240
what would it look like if you did that

1191
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,520
on purpose

1192
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,800
with a purpose what will it cost you

1193
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,760
five minutes of time

1194
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,520
that's what i want for you

1195
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,319
so

1196
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,640
think about it that way

1197
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,680
and then

1198
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,400
also looking at clarity

1199
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,720
again having that the reason

1200
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,119
uh that i do the things i do i talked

1201
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,800
about you know the commute time that i

1202
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,240
used to have now it's just going down to

1203
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,599
the basement so it's like i gotta talk

1204
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,040
really fast i like to go down 15 steps

1205
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,440
as is my commute now versus in the past

1206
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
driving around atlanta but again

1207
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,200
what are three things that only i can do

1208
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
and how can i hold myself to account to

1209
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,480
make sure that i'm doing those

1210
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,400
respective things that's what we're

1211
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,040
looking at there

1212
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,000
great book uh here greg mcewen this idea

1213
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,359
of essentialism anyone read this book

1214
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,960
so greg mcewen yeah so greg

1215
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,160
that idea of all the meanings of all the

1216
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,119
responsibilities of all the things that

1217
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,680
we have to do how our mind gets as

1218
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
cluttered as the diagram at the top left

1219
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,839
there that idea he gives the analogy of

1220
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,000
looking at your closet like literally

1221
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the closet say in your bedroom of all

1222
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,920
your clothes and all your

1223
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,960
besides augusta shirts

1224
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,319
and all the other shirts and all the

1225
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,760
other things that you have

1226
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
and how when it's a big clutter it's

1227
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,440
hard to go and find

1228
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,200
the shirt that you're looking for it's

1229
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,400
hard to find the pants that you're

1230
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,520
looking for

1231
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,040
or the shorts that you're wanting to

1232
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,280
wear whatever but this idea of what are

1233
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,359
some things that only i can do

1234
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,160
is a way to think about clearing out all

1235
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,920
that junk getting saying no to those

1236
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,520
meetings stopping those assignments

1237
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,960
getting out of those groups and out of

1238
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
those

1239
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,920
gatherings where you're not uniquely

1240
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,079
qualified and set up for success to be

1241
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,520
successful in that way

1242
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,240
time i've learned that no

1243
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,919
is a complete sentence

1244
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,839
now i've learned that now old 52 year

1245
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,880
old man finally learning that a no is a

1246
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,640
complete sentence

1247
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,359
not a no i don't want to not i'll ask

1248
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,880
you later that i did

1249
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,319
let me get back with you later i'll tell

1250
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,040
you no

1251
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,040
no

1252
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,440
that's not something that only i can do

1253
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,240
no

1254
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,319
i shouldn't run and take over from the

1255
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,480
chief instant handling team a minor

1256
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,640
incident that i'm still talking about

1257
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,640
seven years later

1258
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,440
no

1259
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,359
that's not something that aligns to the

1260
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,839
mission of our respective organization

1261
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,280
no

1262
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,119
that's not my job right now no that's

1263
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,839
not something that only i can do

1264
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,920
a dear friend and former colleague of

1265
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,480
mine a single mother

1266
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,119
from dallas texas she would say when

1267
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,280
someone asked her as a senior cyber

1268
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,440
security leader ceso of a very important

1269
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,119
company

1270
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,800
when they would ask her to do something

1271
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
her name's bridget when she said they

1272
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,000
say hey bridget will you come serve on

1273
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,280
this committee hey bridget will you go

1274
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,800
write that policy hey bridget will you

1275
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
go do whatever

1276
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,240
she said she would literally close her

1277
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,040
eyes and in her mind's eye have a

1278
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,400
picture of her daughter abby

1279
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,359
and all of a sudden when she could see

1280
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,440
in her mind's eye a visual of her

1281
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,960
daughter abby

1282
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,359
she could make a better decision

1283
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,119
do i want to be on that committee and be

1284
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,640
away from my daughter

1285
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,800
or would i'd rather be with my daughter

1286
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,920
i don't have a daughter whose name is

1287
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,359
abby i have a daughter whose name is

1288
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,720
lindsay i have a son whose name is

1289
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
jackson but i would when she said that i

1290
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,480
thought that makes it so much easier to

1291
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,280
decide am i going to say yes to this or

1292
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,760
should i say no to that from a family

1293
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,880
perspective

1294
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,280
in addition to the things that you get

1295
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,119
required and compelled to do in

1296
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,760
corporate life as well

1297
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,839
there's a little hack from a dear friend

1298
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,880
uh bridget on how she personified that

1299
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,240
she wanted to be a great mother and one

1300
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,440
of the ways that she was able to do that

1301
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,480
is to

1302
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,280
imagine what's at stake when i say yes

1303
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
i'm going to stay late

1304
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,040
when i say yes i'm going to work the

1305
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,400
weekend when i say yes i'm going to do

1306
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,040
those things

1307
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,920
unless i have in my mind what's at stake

1308
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,680
like a picture of my wife or my son or

1309
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,839
my daughter or important things that i

1310
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,680
want to do i might go ahead and say well

1311
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,000
yeah there's room on my calendar

1312
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,680
i'll go ahead and say yes

1313
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,839
put systems in place find the things

1314
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,599
that are most important to you spouse

1315
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,280
friends family neighbor whatever it

1316
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,599
might be ups drivers amazon doesn't

1317
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,800
matter what it is but imagine who

1318
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,079
are the things and people that are

1319
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,800
important to you and before you say yes

1320
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
i'll do that

1321
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,000
think of what you're going to say no to

1322
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
if i say yes to this thing i've said no

1323
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,400
to everything else that could happen at

1324
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,559
that particular time and also be aware

1325
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,440
that

1326
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,119
with success

1327
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,640
comes a lot of opportunity the more

1328
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,400
successful that you become the more your

1329
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,160
boss promotes you gives you raises gives

1330
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,680
you assignments gives you more than one

1331
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,919
job to do at a time hypothetically first

1332
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,400
the more you're going to have to

1333
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,040
recognize that and find a visualization

1334
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,960
or find a practice to where you're not

1335
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,559
just doing all the things for all the

1336
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,160
people all the time

1337
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,160
you'll find yourself in a bad way

1338
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,240
what i like to do is to do a calendar

1339
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,240
audit so this is

1340
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,000
the second day

1341
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,319
of the first quarter for this year so

1342
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,680
monday

1343
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,040
i've got a calendar appointment you know

1344
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,400
i saw my calendar when we got plugged in

1345
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,920
earlier it's full of reminders full of

1346
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,119
things

1347
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,800
at the beginning of every quarter i go

1348
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,559
to a calendar audit

1349
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,400
what are recurring meetings recurring

1350
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
tasks recurring items that i have on my

1351
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,280
calendar now that might not be most

1352
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
appropriate for the fourth quarter of

1353
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,520
this year are there some places where i

1354
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,640
can say

1355
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,440
no

1356
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,119
i don't want to go there anymore no i

1357
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,960
don't need to go do that anymore no

1358
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,559
that's not going to help me achieve my

1359
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,040
goals my end of the year goals

1360
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,280
i'm going to have a reminder go off at

1361
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,760
some point monday morning that says go

1362
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,839
revisit that go make sure that the

1363
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,599
things on

1364
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,599
your calendar horizon

1365
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,079
are still things that matter a lot so be

1366
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,400
aware of success and put some systems in

1367
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,319
place to help you nudge you so that you

1368
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,559
have to keep brain space of remembering

1369
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,240
that every quarter but maybe just you

1370
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,920
know a minute

1371
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,400
recurring calendar reminder am i still

1372
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,839
working on the things i need to work on

1373
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,839
and have it remind you every 90 days you

1374
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,520
set up a system and the system can

1375
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,400
remind you periodically to do the things

1376
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,839
such as say no

1377
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,400
the last one to talk about 10 minutes

1378
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,839
left and i'm going to see how quickly we

1379
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,040
can land the plane ahead of schedule

1380
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,559
is this

1381
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,119
customer service

1382
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,520

have in place

1390
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,599
one of the reasons one of the many

1391
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,040
reasons they have that from horace

1392
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,480

1398
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,160
his employees to be able to meet if not

1399
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,240
exceed the needs of the guests and

1400
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,280
matter of fact that you may have heard

1401
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,960
this statement ladies and gentlemen

1402

serving ladies and gentlemen

1403
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,480
that's where it came from

1404
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,440
they actually have pre-approved any

1405
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,119
associate

1406
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,440
working at ritz carlton when they see a

1407
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,960
problem that a guest has

1408
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,720
pre-approved them to be able to spend up

1409
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,400
to two thousand dollars

1410
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,520
per incident to fix that problem

1411
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,000
whatever that problem is no rules no

1412
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
forms no approvals no

1413
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,480
just fix the problem we want to

1414
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,640
have ladies and gentlemen serving ladies

1415
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,118
and gentlemen

1416
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,799
what lunch great

1417
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,079
when you go to chick-fil-a matter of

1418
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,160
fact when i picked my sandwich after

1419
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,559
depositing my uh ticket

1420
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,559
and the person put the chick-fil-a thing

1421
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,480
in my hand

1422
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,559
and i said thank you what was the

1423
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,359
response that they gave back to me

1424
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,000
my pleasure

1425
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,559
why is that

1426
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,720
we can get a chicken sandwich anywhere

1427
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,160
and it cost about the same thing

1428
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,240
a couple bucks get some fries get a diet

1429
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,640
coke i'm on my way

1430
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,040
why is it that i go

1431
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,400
to a certain place to get my chicken

1432
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,280
sandwiches versus other places that

1433
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,079
maybe have chickens from the same place

1434
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,440
and maybe it's even a little bit cheaper

1435
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,079
what you may not know

1436
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,480
is that leaders senior leaders a lot of

1437
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,520
leaders from chick-fil-a

1438
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,520
got their customer service training

1439
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,000
right there

1440
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and friend of mine eddie who used to be

1441
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
those trainers he would go to companies

1442
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,760
and chick-fil-a and other companies and

1443
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,599
say here's what makes ritz carlton

1444
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,599
culture so wonderful it was the focus on

1445
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,000
service

1446
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,559
how can i realize that

1447
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,119
every job ever had so far hasn't been in

1448
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,599
place to do cyber but cyber helps the

1449
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,359
company maybe it lets them take more

1450
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,280
risks maybe it helps them

1451
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,000
to

1452
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,160
protect their assets better at growing

1453
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,440
developing doing all things companies

1454
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,040
but i talked my friend eddie has done a

1455
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,520
lot of education

1456
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,160
such as chick-fil-a

1457
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,599
said eddie what's the biggest mistake

1458
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,960
you've traveled around the world you've

1459
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,480
trained people you've lived in that

1460
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,000
culture you've done things you've been

1461
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,359
very successful

1462
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,800
in the foods and beverage service

1463
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,160
industry

1464
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,839
what's the number one mistake that you

1465
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,680
see and what he told me was

1466
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,000
the number one mistake that my friend

1467
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,559
eddie in atlanta sees when he did this

1468
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,839
training was

1469
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,000
people get excited they get in the room

1470
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,599
yeah we need to go do that we need to

1471
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,280
have my pleasure or whatever the

1472
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
statement whatever that cultural

1473
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,720
improvement would be at your company

1474
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,400
but when they get back to their job on

1475
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,920
monday

1476
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,000
they don't take action

1477
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,760
knowing what to do

1478
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,720
and not doing it

1479
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,319
but it'll be like

1480
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,119
look for places to delight

1481
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,640
what would it look like whether you save

1482
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,000
my pleasure whether you give two

1483
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,760
thousand dollar free approval whatever

1484
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,079
it is what would it look like for you as

1485
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,000
someone who's privileged to lead people

1486
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that lead people that do cyber what

1487
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,680
would it look like if you had a phrase

1488
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,079
or you had a motto or you had a contest

1489
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,400
or you had something even goofy

1490
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,200
that they could align to and then better

1491
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,800
serve those that you're privileged to

1492
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,640
work with what if you instead of saying

1493
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,960
users those stupid users i hate saying

1494
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,119

their field too

1515

1516
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,119
capability to have like this

1517
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,200
looks

1518
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,280
the balls who

1519
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,960

1520
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,520
body from getting hurt from steel on

1521

to make stoves

1524
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
i'm grateful for that

1525
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,040
and i'm also grateful that that's not my

1526
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,839
story right now because i look for some

1527
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,720
keys to make me be the very best version

1528
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,839
of myself i've solved a problem being

1529
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,160
eaten

1530
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,960
need to be busy but when i ask a

1531
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,559
question of what are some things that

1532
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,960
only i

1533
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,160
is this something that only i can do

1534
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,599
it's like that

1535
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,319
doing the cafeteria test when i unlocks

1536
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,160
eyes with me

1537
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,960
there's russell he solves my problems

1538
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
there's russell i'd rather leave than

1539
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,319
have to talk to ross i'm going to skip

1540
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,920
my lunch because

1541
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,000
what's the response how are you showing

1542
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
up that's how we win

1543
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,240
through four things constraints

1544
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,680
whether you put them on yourself or

1545
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,040
they're placed upon you how can you

1546
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,960
leverage them culture

1547
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,640
one of the most important things for you

1548
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
as a leader is this something that only

1549
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,839
i can do

1550
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,280
creating supporting refining improving

1551
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,880
the culture of those that are privileged

1552
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,599
to lead that's how you win as a so

1553
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,160
having the clarity these are things that

1554
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,359
only i can do if i don't do them

1555
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,440
my team is not going to be the best in

1556
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,720
the world they're not going to have the

1557
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,240
access or the tools or the

1558
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,760
representation

1559
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,599
that they need in order to be successful

1560
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,520
customer service we saw it today at

1561
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,920
lunch when someone handed you your

1562
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,280
chicken sandwich

1563
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,119
and you said thank you

1564
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,040
you experienced

1565
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,160
in my opinion legendary customer service

1566
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
because they've been trained they say

1567
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,680
that and i think in most cases they

1568
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,680
actually mean it is their pleasure to

1569
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,119
put a chicken sandwich

1570
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,520
in your hand

1571
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,520
i'll end with this the very best advice

1572
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,280
i've ever been given was given to me

1573

1574
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,799

1575
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,839
