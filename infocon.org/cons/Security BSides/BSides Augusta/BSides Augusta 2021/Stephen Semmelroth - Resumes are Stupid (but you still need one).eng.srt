1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,360
all right let's get started my name is

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,440
stephan semelroth and today we're going

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,080
to talk about some things that

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640
everyone hates

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,080
no one likes this stuff

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
who likes writing resumes

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
who likes looking in the mirror

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,079
at yourself and seeing all of your flaws

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,120
i don't

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
i don't like it at all

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,440
i hate my own resume

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
i can't stand it

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
so why by

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,320
thousands of other people's resumes

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,480
and stared at them and red penned them

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,719
to make sure that they can win

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
oh it is frustrating and it's hard and

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
it hurts sometimes but when you get it

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
right it wins and you win and whoever's

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,320
going to hire you wins or if you're a

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,239
hiring manager you get to go find

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,600
somebody else that's going to be awesome

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
and help you win

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,119
that's why we're going to talk about

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,880
resumes today we're going to talk about

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
resumes because it's a thing that you

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
have to do not a thing that you want to

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
do

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,560
period

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
all right uh there's my linkedin connect

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,520
with me i'll have that out a couple

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,439
times my goal is to make sure that the

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,840
community wins one of my personal goals

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
is that we get to a full

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
up-level

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,799
community of cyber security

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,320
practitioners

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,479
my goal is that everyone in this room

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,479
right now you

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,520

a lot of people are

51

so copyright

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
nothing that i'm going to talk about

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
related to any experiences i may have

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
had or currently still have or anything

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,360
that's covered under nda

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
and of course continue at your own risk

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
you'll be dragons and don't hack things

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,680
you're not supposed to

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
okay

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
the guys

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,959
talk

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,599
so over 20 years responded to my first

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
cyber incident

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
i didn't value the experience when i did

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319
it it was the nimdi virus absorb smb

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,519
has anybody

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,920
employed it or responded to smb in the

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
last year

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
thank you yep it's still out there's

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
still smb flaws and the thing is the 84

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,160
hour incident response that i just

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
finished last night

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,280
i asked

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
the same questions during that instant

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
response that i did 20 years ago

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,920
because the landscape has really not

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,159
changed the way that we lead

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,480
organizations through incident response

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
really hasn't changed and it's all about

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
people which is why we're going to talk

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
about resumes

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,958
um

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
west point infantry electrical

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
engineering uh we can talk about that

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
later in 2015 i found out i had broken

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
my back

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
and i had to have a spinal fusion and

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
when i woke up from surgery

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,519
my my friend uh who's

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,239
hilarious a phenomenal sense of humor

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,519
he's standing at the foot of my bed and

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
i can't see what he's doing

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
i said

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
come on doc

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
give me a break

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
he goes no really can you feel this

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
no i can't

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,519
it'll probably come back

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,040
that's what he told me it'll probably

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,360
come back by it he meant feeling and the

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
ability to walk

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
look what i'm doing

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,290
awesome

104
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,159
[Applause]

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,760
i don't have that many prizes but keep

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
going

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,319
um

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,760
so then i came down here came to the

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
cyber corps got picked up pretty early

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,599
on which was which is a really

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
challenging part as we were building

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
this community as

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
the cyber center was not here yet the

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
formation of the industry hasn't here

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,478
hasn't been here there were things that

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
were happening but there was a big

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
structure around it and we got to be

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
part of writing what the cyber corps has

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
come become today

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
in 2019 i ended up getting quickly

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
retired and i thought

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
how am i going to take

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
what i have done the network that i've

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
built out the amazing people that i know

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
and help them out in their careers what

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
am i going to do what does that even

127
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
look like

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
i thought oh

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
i'll just do the same thing that i've

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,800
always done and help people out but i i

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
need to get paid to do that how can i do

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,759
that

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,400
oh i'll build a recruiting company

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
so i did

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,240
2019 i launched my company

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
um

137
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
and i thought you know what this will be

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
this will be something i do in my spare

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,520
time this will be something that i do

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,639
for fun just

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,840
the community

142
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,160
so that's where i started really diving

143
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
into the craft of resume writing and

144
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,919
what it is because if you're going to do

145
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,320
something the tradecraft that you apply

146
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
best in the world

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
it must be the best in the world for you

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,479
to succeed because if you're not

149
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,479
competing sorry i walk around a lot

150
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
you're going to keep you busy if you're

151
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
not competing

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
then you're just there to show up

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
and competition is what we do

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,680
because that is how we win in cyber

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
security if we're not competing against

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
the adversary or against corporate

157
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
against our bosses

158
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
then how are we really going to win how

159
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
are we going to sharpen the edge of what

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
we do

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,440
in order to get to victory

162
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
so that was why recruiting

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
cool great

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
became a mastermind craft read damn near

165
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
every single

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,479
resumes on the market

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,880
i talked i went to webinars i went

168
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
very very frustrated because no one

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,080
agrees on any of this

170
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
and we'll touch back on that in a second

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
2020

172
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,039
um 14 months into launching my company

173
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
i sold it

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,039
what

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,479
holy cow

176
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,240
i've only been doing this for 14 months

177
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
and i've built something that's good

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
enough to sell

179
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
incredible i didn't think i didn't think

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,479
i'd be at that point yet i didn't

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
anticipate it i didn't plan on it but it

182
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
went back to my mission of being able to

183
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
get more people

184
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
amazing jobs to increase their family's

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
happiness

186
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
okay if that's the case and this aligns

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
with who i am as a person game on let's

188
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
go no looking back

189
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,400
let's go

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
okay

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
um so what i'm doing now is uh after i

192
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
sold it i'm effectively a vsazo i come

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
in i help my clients understand at the

194
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,440
sizzo level what it is their security

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,639
posture

196
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
help them through incident response help

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,639
them through disasters get them back up

198
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
and going and have a whole lot of fun

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
while we're doing it

200
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
because i happen to thrive in conflict i

201
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
really enjoy it so the more conflict

202
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
there is the better for me because i'm a

203
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
glutton for punishment but when we can

204
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
provide a stabilizing force and we can

205
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
come together and everyone's freaking

206
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
out and we say hey let's just take a

207
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,240
second

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,599
let's make sure that we're all on the

209
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,039
same page that we're headed in the right

210
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,639
direction

211
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
and what we're about to do will this

212
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
actually have an impact it will great

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,160
so because of that i convinced my

214
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
marketing team that uh

215
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,479
mentoring people is a part of marketing

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
so i spent

217
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,919
about two and a half hours a week and

218
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,440
just mentoring people in this community

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,680
so if you'd like to connect with me ask

220
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
we'll we'll find a time to make sure

221
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,800
that

222
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
we can talk about where you want to go

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
with your career so all that to say

224
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,560
resumes

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,440
why

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
the heck do we even need a resume

227
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
anymore we've got linkedin we've got a

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
social media profile we have medium

229
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
where you can go and you can write and

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
you can put out the content that shows

231
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
that you are the best in the world out

232
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
there we've got hack the box we've got

233
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
all these amazing things

234
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
that

235
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,360
uh

236
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,479
why do i still need a stupid one slide

237
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,879
piece of paper

238
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,599
that maybe encapsulates who i am

239
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,799
because when we look at it

240
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
not everybody in the organization knows

241
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
what those things are

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
so for every one cyber practitioner

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
that's out there there are 10 it people

244
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,279
that are keeping the lights on the grass

245
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,519
scene and for every 10 it people that

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,959
are keeping the lights on the grass

247
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,399
screen which is an incredibly

248
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,120
challenging thing to do by the way

249
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
there are 100 developers

250
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
so think about it

251
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
from an hr and a recruiting standpoint

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,519
if you have an hr person their job is to

253
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,200
go out and bring in 100 developers and

254
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
10 it people and one cyber security

255
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,279
person why the hell are they going to

256
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
know the difference between cissp and

257
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
sec plus

258
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
why are they going to take that time

259
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
when you look at the cyber security

260
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,839
certification landscape and there's

261
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,360
105 or so different certifications that

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
could be considered cyber

263
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
there's 30 on there that i don't even

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
know what they are yet

265
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
so if i don't know that why would an hr

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
person especially a junior hr person my

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
brother what's going on good to see you

268
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
oh man they're just coming in what's up

269
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
guys

270
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
i'm not sorry about this but here's

271
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
something that's really hard to know

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,880
in

273
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
the resume world no matter what you do

274
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
you're going to be wrong

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,760
the goal

276
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,480
is to be the least wrong possible

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
hey stefan i just had i paid 500 for

278
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,079
somebody to look at my resume read it

279
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,000
and i think i've got a really good

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
that's amazing let me see it

281
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
who did this for you

282
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
my cousin's friend's aunt well she's an

283
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
hr person and she works at uh at a

284
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
trucking company

285
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
that is great i'm sure she's the best in

286
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
the world she does but she doesn't have

287
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
the context about bits and bytes that we

288
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,880
do so i'm sorry that you spent that

289
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,360
money maybe you can go get a refund it's

290
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
not going to help you in the space

291
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
hiring managers don't know how to read

292
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
it

293
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,839
and we're going to get a couple other

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,200
places they don't know how to read it

295
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
they don't know what it means

296
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
because the way that it was written was

297
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,640
not for them

298
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
who are the four audiences

299
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
we talk hiring manager i like this one

300
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
on the left

301
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
the 23 year old screener with a couple

302
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
years of experience in hr who makes the

303
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
pass

304
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
oh

305
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
that's the person that's going to put me

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
in the yes no or maybe bucket

307
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
shoot

308
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
they need to be able to read this

309
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,240
they need to be able to read it so if i

310
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
put my resume in a json format and

311
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
publish it to my own personal website

312
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,279
because then the hiring manager will

313
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
know it you've missed the other three

314
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,680
audiences

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
recruiter there's internal and external

316
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
recruiters

317
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
an internal recruiter at a company

318
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,920
probably works for hr they might have an

319
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
idea of what's going on

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
an external recruiter which is what i

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,320
was

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
that specializes in a pacific area

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
they're going to know

324
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
funny story the best recruiters that i

325
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,240
know that are in the cyber security are

326
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
all electrical engineers so if there's

327
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
any ees out there

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680

329
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,920
let you know how to set up your company

330
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
the hiring manager that's who we all

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
want to talk to

332
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,399
because they know the difference between

333
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
splunk and elk heyo

334
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,200

we all hate them

339
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,040
unfortunately they are part of this

340
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
project of

341
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
uh who are the four audiences so we when

342
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
we craft a stupid resume

343
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
when we do the work

344
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
we have to think about all four of these

345
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
audiences can i get this past an

346
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
applicant tracking system can their

347
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
hiring manager actually get a chance to

348
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,600
see it

349
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
the recruiter saying what the heck am i

350
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
writing and then the yes maybe bucket

351
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
person 23 screener can they understand

352
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,839
what this is as well and remember 110

353
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,160
one

354
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
that's the battle that we're fighting

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,480
with a stupid piece of paper

356
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
so again we can't agree here's a couple

357
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
of books that are out there

358
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
and i wanted to take a look at

359
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
just the top you know one of the top

360
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
lines an objective statement versus a

361
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,760
career summary which one's more

362
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,880
important should we even have them

363
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
turns out that's an incredibly

364
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,360
challenging problem statement

365
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
so ladders they're the ones that uh had

366
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
the quote for the four audiences they

367
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,200
said never use an objective statement

368
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
and you should absolutely use a career

369
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,160
summary

370
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
mistake says never never

371
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,279
crap okay we gotta do more research

372
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,120
here's three more

373
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,279
sometimes yes never yes sometimes yes

374
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,920
ah

375
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
so what's right

376
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,839
well

377
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
you depends on where you're at here what

378
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,519
you have done

379
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,600
and where you want to go

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
are you in a major

381
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
last 20 years taking care of your kids

382
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
now you're getting back into the

383
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,959
workforce

384
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
are you transitioning

385
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,480
have you transitioned out of the

386
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
military where are you in that in the

387
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,040
pipeline and are you going to transition

388
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
career fields

389
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
you want to switch from hardcore eyes

390
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
down tech

391
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
engineering

392
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,079
ep

393
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,120
so

394
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,600
based off this objective summary might

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,560
be right but probably not the way

396
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,279
recruiters are

397
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
um

398
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,239
the objective

399
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
just to beat the applicant tracking

400
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,600
system often who here has applied for

401
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,720
more than 50 jobs online

402
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,720
who here's applied for more than 100

403
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
who here's applied for more than 200

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,839
look around it's a real thing

405
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,480
had

406
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
resumes aren't the actual answer

407
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,920
okay so what type

408
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
has anybody heard about a functional

409
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,440
resume

410
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
burn it out of your mind now

411
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
as a recruiter if i see

412
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,399
me

413
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,399
i

414
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,720
see a functional resume

415
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
it tells me that

416
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,680
if i have to go through and figure out

417
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
where the hell you worked for how long

418
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
you worked there and what you did

419
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
that takes me more than 15 seconds

420
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,560
and you're not worth the time

421
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
hard truth

422
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,880
if i have to do the work to to read your

423
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
damn resume

424
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,279
and figure it out when i have

425
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
because you're probably trying to hide

426
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,279
something and when you do and you go

427
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,399
through and you do the case studies of

428
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,399
why do you have a functional resume well

429
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,160
i heard that it's important getting a

430
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,839
general

431
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,279
that's why i did it okay what else did

432
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,439
you do

433
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,518
that's when i was in prison

434
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
oh

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
okay you actually you legitimately are

436
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,519
trying to hide something and i've got

437
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,759
enough anecdotes

438
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
great you're all graduates of snl tap

439
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,440
let's just talk about something here and

440
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
this is this is a resume i believe i got

441
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,160
all the pi

442
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,839
first of

443
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,839
what is that like eight lines not gonna

444
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
read it sorry don't care

445
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,720
um

446
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,359
classic here's uh nine bullet points

447
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,039
about things that i think the applicant

448
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,119
track key system wants to learn about me

449
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,559
oh good risk management so does

450
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,439
everybody else we're in cyber security

451
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,319
here

452
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,000
hey look i had

453
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
for

454
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,199
a little while and somehow

455
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
split

456
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
what did you actually do

457
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,520
there's lots of words here but how do i

458
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
know that you're a performer

459
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
how that you actually move the needle at

460
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
an organization that we took a project

461
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
and got it from start to finish that we

462
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
executed that we made sure that our

463
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
clients were happy making sure that we

464
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,919
brought in revenue to the company or

465
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720
that we reduced cost

466
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
it doesn't say that at all

467
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
and oh by the way an application system

468
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,320
anyone having to talk to a developer

469
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,600
that has built an applicant tracking

470
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
system

471
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,360
oh i have

472
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
that is another story

473
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,080
to give you this

474
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,280
your best

475
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,559
a developer

476
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,760
put on the things that are going to make

477
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
you money and your interns are the ones

478
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,160
that build you out

479
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,600
so any time you put in an app a resume

480
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
and they look at it

481
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
somebody had a semicolon

482
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,919
consistent broker system because we

483
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,960
didn't actually do proper scrubbing so

484
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
anytime there's something that we don't

485
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
understand we just drop the resume out

486
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,760
of our system

487
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,640
real talk it's a thing

488
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,600
so we don't put silly things like uh

489
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,400
graphs tables pictures

490
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
actually embedded hyperlinks colors we

491
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
have to keep it simple because an

492
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
applicant tracking system is one of the

493
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
stupid four audiences we're writing this

494
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,159
for in the first place

495
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
who's seen this resume

496
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
it's all over the place right

497
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,919
marissa mayer

498
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,600
ceo of yahoo this is her resume

499
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,240
no it's not this is not her resume this

500
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,039
is a company that designs resumes that

501
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,039
decided to make this one as a marketing

502
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,000
tool

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
to go through and push it so you all

504
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
everybody that's seen this and thought

505
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
that this was a great idea

506
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
you got social engineered by a marketing

507
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
team

508
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,559
oh

509
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,559
it looks like it's a great idea

510
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
but remember

511
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,360
hiring managers is only one of four

512
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
audiences

513
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
and also mercenaries don't need no

514
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
resume

515
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,039
she's not gonna need one in the first

516
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,080
place

517
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
okay what do you need in the header

518
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
because i'm gonna give you some tactical

519
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
realistic things that you are going to

520
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
take away with one name

521
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
you'd be surprised

522
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,200
you'd be surprised when i see resumes

523
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
and there's no name on it

524
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
or a phone number

525
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
or an actual email address

526
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
huh

527
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,120
wait does that say clearance

528
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,880
i can put my clearance on my resume

529
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,919
you're damn right you can put your

530
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
clearance on your resume and if you have

531
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,080
one and you're applying for a job that

532
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
requires a clearance and you don't put

533
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,840
it on your resume

534
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
guess which bucket you go into you go

535
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,520
into the no bucket

536
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
but i thought if i was a performer

537
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
then they can see that by this beautiful

538
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,960
piece of paper that i've written

539
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,799
they're going to call me and see if i've

540
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,919
got my resume and they're going to go

541
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,600
check in the sister of my clearance and

542
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
they're going to go check in the system

543
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
no they won't because they don't know if

544
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,280
you did and if you don't have it on

545
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,559
there you're disqualified

546
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,559
that's right

547
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,240
conversation i've had literally hundreds

548
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
of times

549
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
when you can work available date if

550
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
you're transitioning you must have it on

551
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
there

552
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,679
if you are already out in the field

553
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,120
maybe you need it maybe you don't

554
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
probably not

555
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,280
um if you're going to move

556
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,159
where you're going to move to in the

557
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
current city and i say city i

558
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,520
specifically don't say address because

559
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
what if you're from the wrong side of

560
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,760
the railroad tracks

561
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,919
are you going to let a recruiter

562
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,240
discriminate on you

563
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
based off of where you happen to put

564
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
your head down at night

565
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,559
hell no

566
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
so don't put your address put your city

567
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,360
or your region

568
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,640
because why would you want to

569
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,360
know

570
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,720
because of a preconceived notion that

571
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
they have about you

572
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,640
and then of course if you've got

573
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,159
linkedin github or website put them on

574
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,080
there as well um

575
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
flat

576
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,840
html not an actual link just

577
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,720
https colon slash

578
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,400
and then again no links no icons no

579
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,480
tables no little linkedin

580
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,919
little bubble

581
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
don't do it because it's probably going

582
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,320
to break an applicant tracking system

583
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,559
okay most important things first we have

584
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,159
three

585
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,320
resumes here first one on the left

586
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,919
education work experience sales

587
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
certifications and volunteering this is

588
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,720
what a junior resume should look like in

589
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
terms of order

590
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,679
put the most important thing about you

591
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,520
first if i have to dig through it

592
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,440
to figure out whether you're qualified

593
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,760
that's on you that's not on me tell me

594
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
what i need to know about you first if

595
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
you just graduated or you're about to

596
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,039
graduate from a program

597
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,600
put it up there

598
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
carnegie mellon masters of computer

599
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
science applied

600
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,200
tingles i want that

601
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
if that's buried way at the bottom

602
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
because i know out of some programs

603
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,880
you're going to be best in the world and

604
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
if i can't figure that out real quick

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,080
then again probably in the maybe pile if

606
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,280
you're lucky

607
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,640
this next one

608
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,679
this is maybe somebody that's

609
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,120
transitioning

610
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,159
maybe they're coming back to the

611
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,760
workforce they're switching around a

612
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,679
little bit they've got more skills than

613
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,360
they have work experience that's fine so

614
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,799
they put their skills up front

615
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,080
they put it up front

616
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
i'm damn good at regular expressions i

617
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,039
will crush them

618
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,840
okay good now i have an idea of not only

619
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,400
what you're best at but where to put you

620
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,280
boom

621
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,679
this last one this is a senior this is a

622
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,120
senior

623
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
they've got so much work experience i

624
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,480
don't care if they've got it or not

625
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
because i can tell that they're the best

626
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,159
in the world like nando

627
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,480
and then down there yeah they check the

628
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,760
blocks yeah good they've got the they've

629
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
got the degree of the blah blah blah

630
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
okay cool

631
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
nailed that

632
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,240
white space

633
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
when you see

634
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
a resume that looks like this

635
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
that's got all this ton of wasted white

636
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
space on there

637
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
when a bullet goes one line and then one

638
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,240
word

639
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
on another line

640
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,679
you are

641
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,400
self-selecting into the ability to not

642
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
really utilize that and tell me about

643
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
you

644
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
so either

645
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,919
write smaller

646
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,840
or add enough information to close the

647
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,919
gap to get information all the way out

648
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,720
there

649
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,080
i know

650
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
oh look at that

651
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,760
carry return on the uh the page um

652
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
about how to write this shorter harder

653
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,760
smaller

654
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,120
the community the community will help

655
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
you edit

656
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,320
here's another one

657
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,559
you see this all the time cool look i've

658
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,400
got columns

659
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,799
this is only good if you're going into a

660
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,679
job

661
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,520
that's ui focused

662
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
user interface focused design focused

663
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,919
marketing focused

664
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
that's the only time to do columns

665
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
because again

666
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
applicant tracking systems can't parse

667
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,840
columns

668
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
oh

669
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,918
stay away from them

670
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
bullets

671
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,039
ah this is the this is where we the most

672
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,480
red penning happens on the bullets

673
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,919
if you're at a company you switch jobs

674
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,159
maybe you go from help desk to pen

675
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,200
tester at the same company

676
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,559
two different bullet sections or two

677
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,799
different actual sections the most you

678
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,679
get

679
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,880
for any role is two to four bullets

680
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
because any more than that it really

681
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
feels like you're just

682
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,279
you're trying to prove a point

683
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,039
that you're good but the more you try to

684
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,240
prove the point that you're good the

685
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,919
harder it feels to know

686
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,799
like

687
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,000
ah

688
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,159
so if i you know i

689
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,679
deployed puppet

690
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
across the scenario deployed ansible

691
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,200
across the scenario deploy this across

692
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,679
the city and each of those is a bullet

693
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,520
i'm going to stop reading because you

694
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,159
could have put ansible comma puppet

695
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,240
comma

696
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,159
and then i would actually go okay

697
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,679
you're in charge of deployment

698
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,840
see the difference

699
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,640
there

700
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
deployed the other thing i like the uh

701
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
the bullet format so either var or car

702
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
challenge action result

703
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,240
very simple

704
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,880
past tense verb ed

705
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
ed

706
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,080
lead which is led by the way not led

707
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,159
that's lead

708
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,200
led

709
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,679
led a team of five engineers to launch a

710
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,520
v1 product in a new marketing space

711
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,320
boom i got that v1 product awesome

712
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,200
excellent i love it use numbers

713
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,200
built a sales funnel of 420 000

714
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,240
a month revenue

715
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,039
oh okay

716
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,120
discovered four cves

717
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
boom all right i'm feeling this i'm

718
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
feeling this okay

719
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,360
and then always just like anything else

720
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,039
we're going to put the most important

721
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
bullet first

722
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
so the thing that you're trying to do

723
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,279
next that is that next bullet

724
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,480
so remember that kind of career

725
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
statement where you want to go in your

726
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,480
future the next job that you have

727
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
that's your problem statement and

728
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,159
everything else on the resume

729
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,880
should be

730
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,440
the documentation that shows why you

731
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
want to go in that direction

732
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,440
think of it like an essay i want to go

733
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,399
here my next job role is here

734
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,399
okay supporting evidence wow

735
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,039
and we get to do that by being brief so

736
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,559
use brevity

737
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
as we write this out

738
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,960
like short

739
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,760
okay

740
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,159
things to avoid

741
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,600
here's the work roll that i did the job

742
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
description

743
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
and then my four bullets of how i

744
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
performed

745
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,480
no one cares what you were responsible

746
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
for

747
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,559
when i was working with those three

748
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,600
gentlemen over there part of my

749
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
responsibility was

750
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,039
to be

751
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,000
uh

752
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
the defense lead for the dark side of

753
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,120
the moon and did we succeed did we

754
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
defend the dark side of the moon

755
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
yes we did

756
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,559
i was responsible for it but we didn't

757
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,000
do anything about it no one attacked the

758
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,279
dark side of the moon so was i

759
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,360
successful that we did a lot of other

760
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
stuff we did amazing stuff we set the

761
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,399
stage for things that are still

762
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,480
happening today

763
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,480
set the stage past tense for

764
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,440
y'all feel me

765
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,399
uh so responsible for again um

766
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,840
not starting with verb to add to that

767
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
three lines of okay and then uh yeah

768
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,679
listing every single technology that you

769
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,360
touched because that just looks like

770
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
you're like you pull it up and it's like

771
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,039
looking at a cdw catalog of all the

772
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,720
different things that you can buy

773
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
i don't care

774
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,159
like let's leave the focus things on the

775
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,840
flip side of that

776
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,960
things that you know if you have a good

777
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,159
recruiter they're going to know what

778
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,399
you're like oscp is

779
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,159
if you have that 23 year old screener

780
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,600
they're not going to know how cali ties

781
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
into oscp and they're not going to know

782
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
that if you've been able to accomplish

783
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,720
oscp you probably understand python ruby

784
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,960
and what an exploit is and how to netcap

785
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,320
so depending on how you craft this and

786
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,360
where you're at in your career you may

787
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,600
need to have some more of those things

788
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
um in the skill section and then you can

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,960
have like you know a couple bullets

790
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,080
so the point is kind of add three but be

791
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,480
judicious about it

792
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,320
again certifications

793
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
they can be important in the space

794
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,919
and they should be important in the

795
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,960
space

796
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,399
but they're for the hiring manager

797
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,440
they're not for the recruiting team so

798
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
put them in the right order

799
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
the most important one first don't put

800
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,840
them in timeline

801
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,000
so if you have you know a gold standard

802
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
certification but you earned it three

803
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,799
years ago

804
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,360
and then you had to for 85 70

805
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,559
requirements you had to go get some

806
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,720
other stupid little thing

807
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,279
don't put the stupid little thing first

808
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,640
put the big one first

809
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,000
because then the recruiter gets to

810
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,120
understand what the heck it is you

811
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,399
actually did

812
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
um

813
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,200
y'all can read i'm not going through

814
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,880
this

815
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,799
okay thanks stefan you told me not what

816
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,919
to do

817
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,480
and what do we do next go to my github

818
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,640
it's right here

819
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,120
the outcome of reading those thousands

820
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,679
of resumes and writing thousands of

821
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
resumes and red penning thousands of

822
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,240
resumes

823
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,640
this in my mind

824
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
and it's free it's open source fork it

825
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,679
make it your own publish it take it i

826
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,360
don't care i want the industry to be

827
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,039
better so it's right there

828
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,360
pull it in

829
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,399
let's talk about a little bit more

830
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,480
okay

831
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,919
so when you actually pull it up there's

832
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,360
two documents in there there's the

833
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
guidance one which has a lot of the

834
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,399
things that we've talked about in here

835
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,000
read through it

836
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,159
read through it internalize it

837
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,880
understand what it is that you're doing

838
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,960
get to know it get to feel it

839
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
because this is the thing that you will

840
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,600
be judged by whether that is wrong or

841
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,720
right whether it feels good or it feels

842
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,120
bad

843
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
so get to know it it's right there

844
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,960
there's some of the biggest biggest

845
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
things that i've seen and then links if

846
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,399
you don't believe me to other articles

847
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,840
by some of the best people in the world

848
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
that have been doing this like laszlo

849
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,440
bach who ran

850
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,159
google's hr program

851
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,000
so you don't have to believe stefan you

852
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,720
can believe laszlo

853
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
here's the actual thing

854
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,360
um

855
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,159
uh the template itself that's shameless

856
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,440
marketing for when i still own my

857
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
company delete the logo

858
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,640
you don't have to leave it in i gotta

859
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,679
come on you gotta have a little bit of

860
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,720
marketing here

861
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,799
um so it's a template

862
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,200
here it is pretty simple

863
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,880
the red stuff

864
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,840
there it is

865
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,279
it's right there it tells you in the

866
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,120
thing as you build it out i try to make

867
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,039
this as simple as possible because i got

868
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,039
sick of writing y'all's resumes for you

869
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,200
i want to teach you to

870
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,360
that's what i want to do here

871
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,600
um irony is that on the second i don't

872
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,039
think i've got it in this one but uh

873
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,279
yeah

874
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
i listed a bunch of like fake

875
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,799
hub

876
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,120
repositories and uh one of those called

877
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,799
the jager shell

878
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,080
um because i thought would be hilarious

879
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,039
that no one's gonna believe is actually

880
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,399
a thing it's like jagermeister yeager

881
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,320
shell so i put it in built it and uh

882
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,720
i've started to see jaeger's shell on

883
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,240
other resume formats because people have

884
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,840
been copying and using them and then

885
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,440
seeing them actually like submitted to

886
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
applicant tracking systems and people

887
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
have asked me what's yeager shell it's

888
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,120
not a thing it's copy pasta

889
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,880
and then oh by the way this past couple

890
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,559
days um

891
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,240
who here has been contacted by somebody

892
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
probably from another country offering

893
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
to do a certification for you it's

894
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,040
called cheating

895
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,799
[Laughter]

896
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,760
um

897
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,519
one of my friends and i'll probably do a

898
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,360
post on this here shortly one of my

899
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,240
friends asked one of those people if she

900
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,960
could get certified in jaeger shell

901
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,799
so she's denial of servicing the

902
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,080
cheaters

903
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,679
because they spent out they spent three

904
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,880
days looking for the actual

905
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
certification agency for something that

906
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,559
doesn't exist

907
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,200
and i love that that really warms my

908
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,519
heart

909
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,799
okay so we talked about the four

910
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,679
audiences um yeah lame

911
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,640
lame

912
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
could be good could be a good recruiter

913
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,799
hiring the target so the takeaway from

914
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,159
this one is that recruiters won't read

915
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,679
they will scan

916
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,440
so give them an opportunity to see the

917
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,559
things

918
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,240
um objectives are for people that are

919
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,519
transitioning careers or people

920
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
re-entering the job market no by the way

921
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,640
and i can't tell you how many times i've

922
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
had this happen especially uh

923
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,320
because most often it's ladies that stay

924
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
at home take the kids most often from

925
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,720
what i have seen quantitatively

926
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,600
steph and i'm getting back in the

927
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,320
marketplace oh fantastic i'm excited for

928
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
you how can i help

929
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
well i used to be a c-level programmer

930
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,159
20 years ago and and i just don't should

931
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,399
i even put that on my resume

932
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,360
hell

933
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,559
yes you should put it on your resume

934
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,480
because funny story

935
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
c hasn't really changed in 20 years

936
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,159
do you still put a semicolon at the end

937
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,000
of a line yeah

938
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,360
yeah do

939
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,120
so put it on

940
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,559
uh we talked about chronological one and

941
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,440
most presents first and references don't

942
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,320
put

943
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,000
the phone number or the contact

944
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,519
information for your references on your

945
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,279
resume because you're just wasting space

946
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,159
if i reference i'll ask you for them so

947
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,000
have them but don't put it on there

948
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,599
especially once you start publishing

949
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,800
your resume

950
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,119
now you're doxing your references

951
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,239
and they're going to start getting

952
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,119
marketing calls because you had kali

953
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,599
linux on your resume and whoever

954
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,839
database this got dumped into now that

955
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,480
person just got associated with cali and

956
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,079
so they're going to have pen testing

957
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,839
companies calling them to see if they

958
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,760
need a pen test because you put their

959
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
contact information on a resume that

960
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,240
became public

961
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,239
i wouldn't talk about it if it weren't

962
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,560
true

963
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,040
okay what is your way ahead

964
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,560

965
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,000
you can do this

966
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
now that we've got some direction and

967
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,359
we've got a little bit of purpose and

968
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,119
we've got motivation

969
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,680
you can do this you can go make your own

970
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,520
resume

971
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,359

can get it to work and here's the best

981
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,599
thing is the community will help

982
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,640
discord linkedin slack channels all over

983
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,000
the place veterans if you're not a part

984
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,119
of the vet sex slack you should be

985
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,640
get in there now there's a couple other

986
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
ones the community will help you with

987
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
this there's amazing people that they

988
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,680
just love helping people with their

989
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,359
resumes

990
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,880
and now here's the actual piece

991
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,760
it's never about the resume

992
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,280
it's never about the resume

993
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
it's never about the resume because if

994
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,599
you are a good hacker

995
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,400
you're out social engineering right

996
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
because if we can attack layer eight

997
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,720
then layers one to seven crumble

998
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,640
it's the same thing with net uh with

999
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,720
with going out and finding a job

1000
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,839
if you're out networking with the people

1001
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,280
around you

1002
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,119
if you're going

1003
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,200
to mr rodriguez's talk if you're going

1004
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,280
to mister find uh uh

1005
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,760

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,280

your goal every week

1012
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,040

for every two that you go to a week

1024
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,640
try to have coffee with

1025
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,599
two people that you meet at those

1026
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,839
in a year from now

1027
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,599
think about how many cool people that

1028
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,880
you will have met

1029
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,480
so a year from now you've built your

1030
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
network

1031
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,280
you've had those touch points you're

1032
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,640
starting to understand who's who in the

1033
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,079
field and people in the field are

1034
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,920
starting to understand who

1035
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,800
you

1036
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
are

1037
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,079
and then

1038
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,920
jobs start happening they'll say hey

1039
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,320
send me your resume

1040
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,880
now we've gone from submitting 200

1041
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,800
resumes

1042
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
just out there in the wild to yeah give

1043
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,960
me a resume let me let me go talk to hr

1044
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,040
that

1045
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,160
is when the magic happens

1046
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,240
because it's people

1047
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,040
process technology if you start with

1048
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
technology you're wrong

1049
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,280
when microsoft pivoted from focusing on

1050
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,800
people to the product they slumped and

1051
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,920
other people start other companies

1052
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,400
started to

1053
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
microsoft had to go through and rebuild

1054
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,119
their entire talent acquisition they

1055
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,560
started having to go pay for the best

1056
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,079
developers the best project managers the

1057
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,760
best marketers in the world as they were

1058
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,599
coming out of college and now we're just

1059
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,000
starting to see the point where that

1060
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
emphasis has been building and the fruit

1061
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,680
of that

1062
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,520
transition is happening

1063
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
if microsoft can make that pivot so can

1064
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,119
you

1065
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,920
people first make the connections

1066
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,079
shake the virtual hands

1067
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,839
and eventually you'll start getting job

1068
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,839
opportunities

1069
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,920
and then you'll start having too many

1070
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,880
job offers

1071
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,160
too many

1072
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,839

so uh l w u s o three six a c h uh ac

1077
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
1200 wide range

1078
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
i assume that this you can use in

1079
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,320
promiscuous mode so uh

1080
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,200
uh don't hit the wall of sheep please um

1081
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
go out check it out it's usbc which i

1082
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
think is

1083
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,480
happening see the chipsets

1084
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,839
they're still

1085
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,640
old

1086
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,440
so

1087
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,839
who wants it

1088
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
who wants this one

1089
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,359
let me ask a question

1090
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,160
anything

1091
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,560
look the question is um if you're new to

1092
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
the industry

1093
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,119
would you recommend things like ctfs and

1094
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,480
things that you've done on there

1095
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
yes

1096
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
anything that gives me the ability to

1097
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,000
walk to either a hiring manager

1098
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,640
or an hr team or

1099
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
where i can say hey you need to talk to

1100
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
this guy or gal and i fly them something

1101
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
and i don't have to say anything else

1102
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,240
that's a win

1103
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,400
if i have to explain

1104
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
why someone is good

1105
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,560
then it's a lot harder so

1106
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,400
um this is one of my big things for a

1107
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,920
hackbox if you're top four percent or

1108
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,040
higher

1109
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,160
put that on your linkedin profile

1110
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
by the way top 10 per hack usually means

1111
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,598
that you're like logging in

1112
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,839
four percent means you're better than

1113
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,040
most

1114
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,640
or better than half

1115
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,880
so yeah like think things like that uh

1116
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
if you are if you're doing ctf

1117
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,839
especially if you're winning ctfs

1118
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,640
because i go back to three three c's

1119
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,720
um are you competent

1120
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,720
uh

1121
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,599
that's really easy for me to to like get

1122
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,720
to the point and get to yes

1123
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,480
uh the question if you're going for an

1124
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,839
entry level position how do you

1125
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,280
differentiate yourself from other people

1126
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,599
that are going for differentiate

1127
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,040
and other entry level positions

1128
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,599
if you're networking correctly

1129
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,720
you won't really need to

1130
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,240
so

1131
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,760
when i and i say that so let's go back

1132
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,280
to ctfs

1133
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
um

1134
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,839
you come to something like this and you

1135
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,680
go to ctf

1136
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,880
you get in

1137
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,200
you start banging on a problem

1138
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,359
converting emphasis text

1139
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,520
whatever it happens to be right

1140
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
you get the flag you stand up and you

1141
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
celebrate

1142
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,960
it doesn't have to be loud or boisterous

1143
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,480
or anything you just

1144
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,200
yeah just

1145
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,520
and then you get another flag

1146
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
you get another flag and then you run

1147
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,119
into something that you can't get you

1148
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,240
start

1149
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,280
hey

1150
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,319
can you help me with this flag

1151
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560

1152
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,760

1153

with this oh that's all it is awesome

1154
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,160
and then you need a little bit more a

1155
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,920

1157
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,680

1158
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,520

1164
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,720
oodles of anecdotes where people walk

1165
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,799
away from ctfs with jobs

1166
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,319
you'll see hiring managers walk around

1167
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,599
sometimes they'll have their corporate

1168
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,960
shirt on sometimes they won't sometimes

1169
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,079

1183
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,560
will probably get at least 50 60 likes

1184
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,800
man i'm on i'm doing oscp and i'm really

1185
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,160
struggling with

1186
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,640
the sean box it's ip251

1187
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,079
and i just i'm really struggling through

1188
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,319
it but what i have found is as i go

1189
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,680
through this process

1190
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,480
that

1191
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,319
when i landed on the box

1192
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,640
the ip address wasn't what i expected so

1193
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,160
did i just accidentally pivot into

1194
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,680
another network am i in the dev network

1195
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,400
now

1196
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,480
i am in the dev network okay

1197
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,520
so

1198
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,480
here's what i've learned

1199
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,119
you're basically writing a post that's a

1200
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,720
write-up of what you're doing

1201
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,200
that will get attention

1202
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,720
and as

1203
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,000
especially as you go things that are

1204
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,319
difficult if you're honest

1205
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,480
and you're vulnerable and you write down

1206
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,079
the things that you are working through

1207
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,440
people will step in and they'll help you

1208
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,400
which is great because you'll get to

1209
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,079
your goal

1210
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,440
but what they're actually doing whether

1211
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,599
they realize it or not is they're seeing

1212
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,960
if they want to bring you to be part of

1213
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,040
their team

1214
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,920
uh the question was how important is it

1215
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
to celebrate failures uh especially on

1216
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,119
linkedin while you're going through some

1217
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,760
of that part of pain um

1218
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,359
this is something that's kind of divided

1219
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,920
in the the influencer community

1220
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,359
um

1221
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,400
i

1222
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,800
still talk about my failures um

1223
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,720
i do it because i want people to learn

1224
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,720
about it so the way that the way that i

1225
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
message about my failures is probably

1226
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,200
different

1227
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,119
and i do it in a way that i know will

1228
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,720
get less likes we'll get less

1229
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,960
interaction um

1230
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
because unfortunately you know the

1231
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,760
loudest angriest voices in the community

1232
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,440
are the ones that get the most

1233
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,000
interaction

1234
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,760
so when you do it make sure that

1235
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,319
you write it while you're upset

1236
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,319
but you don't post it while you're upset

1237
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
i'm gonna say that again

1238
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,720
write it while you're upset but don't

1239
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,359
post it while you're upset

1240
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,119
and when you do that you can take a step

1241
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,160
back

1242
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
go for a walk play with the dog you know

1243
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
grab a cup of coffee come back in look

1244
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
at what you wrote

1245
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,480
scrub it one more time the content will

1246
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,560
still be there

1247
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,240
massage it a little bit

1248
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,119
and then post it and when you do that

1249
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,119
and you absolutely should because there

1250
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,720
should be a lesson there should be a key

1251
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,079
takeaway from it there should be a call

1252
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,079
to action on the back side and when you

1253
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,599
do all that together then i think you've

1254
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,720
got something that's much more

1255
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,839
meaningful

1256
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,359
that will help the community instead of

1257
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,359
just

1258
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,359
and when you do celebrate that failure

1259
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,200
in a good positive way the community

1260
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,440
responds usually pretty well and

1261
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
specifically on this one

1262
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,560
each of the different social media

1263
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,520
platforms has their own feel to it

1264
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,599
i can't stand twitter very much i watch

1265
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,119
it for like cves and stuff that's coming

1266
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,359
out and announcements about b-sides uh

1267
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,960
but for me twitter drags me down

1268
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,400
emotionally

1269
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
so i will still post to it and still

1270
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,359
engage every now and then but i like to

1271
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,040
be on linkedin where the community

1272
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,400
builds you up and makes you feel good

1273
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,880
about yourself and confirms that you are

1274
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,079
a champion

1275
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,680
and then that perspective helps me drive

1276
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,359
my motivation to continue helping the

1277
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,880
community

1278
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,440
that answer your question

1279
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,119
depends on where you're on your career

1280
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,280
but yes

1281
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,440
can you speak a little bit

1282
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,400
yeah so the question was if you uh if

1283
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,480
you've expired res aspire certifications

1284
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,599
do you put them on your resume or you

1285
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,880
take them out

1286
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,720
i usually recommend leaving them on and

1287
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,839
just putting

1288
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,359
expired yeah because i mean let's be

1289
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,920
real cpes are stupidly expensive with

1290
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,880
some organizations

1291
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,200
now does stefan pay for his cis p every

1292
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,520
time yeah yeah cause i don't because i

1293
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,280
don't do it

1294
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,640
i don't want to do it again

1295
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,760
uh

1296
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,119
and if we're gonna break down different

1297
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,480
organizations i'm not gonna like you

1298
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,160
know shoot any nuclear missiles at

1299
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,760
anybody or anything but there are some

1300
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,119
that i keep going and there's some that

1301
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,960
i honestly like they're not really

1302
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,839
relevant to where i want to go with my

1303
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,960
future if there's a point where i have

1304
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,480
to pivot back to

1305
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,880
a different career path then i might go

1306
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,319
back and actually do those search again

1307
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,839
or whatever the

1308
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,920
most up-to-date one is

1309
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
it's it is a i don't wanna say it's a

1310
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,200
risk decision but it's a calculated

1311
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,559
decision on whether you need to go back

1312
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,480
or not but i usually do just just put

1313
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,839
expired

1314
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,359
because that way at least one point you

1315
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,480
pass the thing let's give you credit

1316
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,640
do you do anything else to get back to

1317
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,319
the industry i'm sorry the question was

1318
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,079
um if you're

1319
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,079
like say you just came out of school

1320
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,599
you're in your first job how do you set

1321
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,319
up your resume for your second job

1322
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,839
do you do anything else in the community

1323
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,559
are you involved in anything do you

1324
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,400
volunteer b-sides

1325
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,680
do you

1326
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,280
do anything else that could help show

1327
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,400
that you're a competitor or champion

1328
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,559
i'm assuming you do so you put those

1329
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,920
things on there

1330
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,119
and then if you're not doing those

1331
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,520
things start doing those things

1332
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,040
uh

1333
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,960
i think i'm on

1334
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,160
four

1335
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,640
different uh

1336
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,720
like education boards or not for profit

1337
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,040
boards maybe it's five now i don't know

1338
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
join them just show up show up show up

1339
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,800
to the meetings get there and then at

1340
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,000
some point they'll be like hey we're

1341
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,440
looking for new officers for next year

1342
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,960
anybody want to apply this is a general

1343
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,000
board seat you don't actually have to

1344
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,520
run for it if we think you're cool

1345
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,480
you're in

1346
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,760
yeah i'll do that

1347
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
and then of those five i think that's

1348
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,839
probably only about 50 hours a month or

1349
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,920
50 hours a year that i i'd invest into

1350
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,680
those specifically

1351
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,240
to help outside of participating in them

1352
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,880
and it's a phenomenal way to really show

1353
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,760
that

1354
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,359
that that you're there that you're ready

1355
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,280
to play ball and that you've got a

1356
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,559
different perspective that other people

1357
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,559
might not have

1358
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,760
yeah it and it's actually super fun too

1359
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,640
really fun rewarding

1360
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,400
the question is does number of pages

1361
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,160
matter yes it does

1362
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
uh because that 23 year old recruiter is

1363
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,599
coming to work probably hungover and

1364
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,720
they can't read more than a page

1365
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:56,960
yep

1366
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,839
so the uh

1367
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,400
outside of the cyber industry one

1368
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,520
standard

1369
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,960
then maybe another page for a cover

1370
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,880
letter but i i don't

1371
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,440
fc uk

1372
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,920
um in my opinion so yeah one page is

1373
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,680
kind of the go to

1374
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,040
usually you can get to one page if

1375
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,839
you're like a mid or a scene

1376
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,680
you're no longer

1377
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,280
to show that you

1378
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,520
can perform you've already performed and

1379
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,119
it's so that the tone and the audience

1380
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,079
are different

1381
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
um if you're a junior or a mid two pages

1382
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,480
is probably about right

1383
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,160
especially when we look at somebody

1384
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
that's really technology focused that's

1385
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,319
on the blue team side because blue team

1386
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,599
you have to show

1387
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,760
proficiency in so many different

1388
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,079
applications and sets and

1389
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,760
whether you're on an e5 license and

1390
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,200
you're working with azure sentinel and

1391
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,559
you've got a sim that's out based and

1392
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,680
there's connectors and you have to show

1393
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,760
that you've got api experience and you

1394
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,280
can push jsons back and forth and you

1395
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,200
can power shell you know out of a wet

1396
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,880
paper bag

1397
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,760
so

1398
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,200
there's there are some times you have to

1399
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,760
go to mine is currently two because i

1400
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
list my conference presentations

1401
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,599
um so like this one will be on there and

1402
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,839
that list is pretty stupidly long

1403
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,000
um but that's because a lot of what i do

1404
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,760
is client-facing

1405
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,680
so it's it's a way to show that uh

1406
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,240
for somebody with a very technical

1407
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,240
hard skilled background that i can still

1408
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,799
talk to people

1409
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,359
i'm so sorry

1410
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,800
uh the question was if you're changing

1411
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,200
fields in this case from accounting to

1412
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,240
to cyber

1413
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,359
cyber um what should you focus on as you

1414
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,720
change those fields

1415
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,879
so

1416
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,319
i'm not going to give you a specific

1417
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,440
answer

1418
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,880
because i don't think it's fair to give

1419
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,559
you a specific answer i knew that one

1420
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,440
was coming

1421
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,280
um i'm not giving you a specific answer

1422
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,160
because i don't know you yet so let me

1423
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,240
walk you through the first 15 minutes or

1424
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,240
so of of the talk that i do with mentors

1425
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,000
or mentees

1426
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,520
hi i'm stefan

1427
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,000

1428
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
well sir i i really want to get into

1429
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,160
cyber security okay why do you want to

1430
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,319
get in cyber security

1431
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,079
okay why

1432
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,160
they respond why they respond they

1433
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,280
respond

1434
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,040
well because i really like i think that

1435
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,480
i can bring a lot to an organization and

1436
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,920
i really like seeing the organization

1437
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,720
change

1438
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,880
there's the c word

1439
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,480
change

1440
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,599
the c in cyber stands for change don't

1441
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,960
believe me come up we'll talk for hours

1442
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,640
the scene cyber stands for change now

1443
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,160
here's the problem as a red teamer very

1444
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
few organizations will actually do what

1445
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,079
you do who's written an executive

1446
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,559
summary come back a year later and cut

1447
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,760
and pasted the executive summary from

1448
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,240
year before

1449
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,520
does that feel good

1450
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,200
does it feel like you were a valuable

1451
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,760
member of the team

1452
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,280
did you affect change at the

1453
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,960
organization when you put your heart and

1454
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,160
soul when it was two o'clock in the

1455
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,119
morning and you finally got root

1456
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,880
and then you told them and they didn't

1457
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,000
do shh

1458
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,839
stuff

1459
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,280
and you came back a year later and that

1460
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,680
box is still there and it's up time is

1461
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,559
380 days

1462
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,240
does that feel good

1463
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,480
did you affect change

1464
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,160
so if you're joining to affect

1465
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,480
the capabilities of each of the roles

1466
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,319
and what it is that you want to do so

1467
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,040
many organizations the cizo reports to

1468
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,119
the cio the chief information officer

1469
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,720
the legit lady or gentleman that runs

1470
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,640
the entire i.t infrastructure of the

1471
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,000
organization

1472
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,160
their job is generally corporate

1473
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,119
they're adjacent to the developer team

1474
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,520
the cto runs the developer team the ctos

1475
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,079
their job is to get code into prod

1476
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,960
so then you as the cisso or the person

1477
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,040
that's reporting to the sizzle you have

1478
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,640
no du jour authority to walk in to the

1479
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,800
cto side of the house and say hey we've

1480
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,520
got three oh days against you right now

1481
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,880
oh okay how much revenue is that

1482
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,440
impacting oh it's not cool then we're

1483
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,200
going to push that into

1484
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,440
two agile cycles and then the guys that

1485
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,640
are you know that wrote that code

1486
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,000
they're on a really important project so

1487
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,200
you're going to get the answer to fix

1488
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,800
the problem and it's going to be a

1489
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,359
band-aid patch and maybe we'll we'll do

1490
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,400
that but

1491
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,640
cool

1492
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,160
so if change is really what you want you

1493
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,680
have to find a good organizational place

1494
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,119
to affect that change

1495
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,799
the culture of that organization has to

1496
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,640
be one of change

1497
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,400
and

1498
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,160
that comes down to you

1499
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,680
so

1500
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,680
that route can be really rough if you

1501
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,839
really like relationships then you know

1502
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:50,960
there's this whole other side of the

1503
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,799
organization the developer side the cto

1504
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,760
side of the house they drive revenue the

1505
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,680
purpose for the company is to make

1506
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,880
revenue

1507
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,720
and they are the ones that are going to

1508
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,279
move so if you're

1509
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,799
the cto side

1510
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,760
your life is like

1511
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,640
then as a vulnerability manager where

1512
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,240
you're constantly trying to fight and

1513
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,680
get things to happen and the other

1514
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,559
people don't want it because it's time

1515
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:17,760
yeah

1516
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,200
different things i think

1517
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,520
um

1518
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,799
okay ask your question

1519
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:31,839
you raised your hand you have to ask a

1520
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,839
question

1521
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,680
so the question was

1522
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,480
in the cyber skills gap where does it

1523
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,119
actually sit um and and how is it

1524
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,720
impacting recruiters and things like

1525
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,480
that that's why we're starting to see

1526
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,119
cyber specific external recruiters come

1527
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,960
to market now we're starting to see

1528
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,240
people that actually have a background

1529
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,520
like me that were able to do it that's

1530
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,720
why i was able to be successful is

1531
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,520
because i

1532
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,799
i know the bits and bytes um internal hr

1533
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,559
usually still

1534
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,000
how to read it that's why

1535
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,640
that's why is the success that's why

1536
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,559
talking to people before you focus on

1537
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,440
processor profit is the way to win

1538
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,760
and if you are a hiring manager the most

1539
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,240
important relationship that you can have

1540
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,200
in terms of

1541
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,680
with your

1542
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,839
more

1543
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,799
later

1544
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,359
good out of this today
