1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,880
all right

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,719
okay with the mics are they working just

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,680
turn them on okay so josh said on iron

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
security today i'm talking about

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,519
the collision that happens

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,039
in physical safety space when digital

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,200
was wrong

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
so let's start

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,760
who am i

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
christian husband

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,640
for me to get a bio

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
wedding anybody um president ceo as i

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
mentioned with that awesome

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,239
and it also means that i do everything

15
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,239
because when no volunteer is available i

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,239
have to do the work

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,360
volunteers

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,840
i do have volunteers i have great

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,520
volunteers uh except for matt i don't

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
know why we keep that guy around

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
former intel uh military intelligence

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
officer former uh military cyber

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
operations officer still doing that in

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
the reserves for the next couple months

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
and then i'm out free

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
um done some published research on

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,680
social network science i do some

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
informal cyber security research so

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
that's kind of on a back burner lately

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,799
with everything going on love me some

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
python you get a lot of trouble with

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
python uh open source intelligence is a

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
blast and then judo is my hobby that i'm

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
so bad at but i just can't give up for

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
whatever reason

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
today's agenda slide decks have agendas

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
you guys don't really care about this

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
well i'm going to frame the talk though

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
is who we are

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,360
what we've been into

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
and how that has been changing my

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,799
perception

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,040
of the role of cyber security

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,119
the role that enables other people to

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,280
succeed

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
you're not going to hear a huge amount

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
of tech in this talk there is some

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
to talk about how joins and relational

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,880
databases can provide them

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
anyone who didn't realize that zeke is

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
fundamentally a bunch of databases with

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
foreign and primary keys you're in for a

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
surprise um

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,959
and we're going to tell a couple stories

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
along the way

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
that i've sanitized i've kind of brought

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,879
them down to a terrible level not only

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,640
for the sake of ndas and all that stuff

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
but for the sake of the violence and

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
whatever else is in them so i do want to

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,080
give you kind of a warning in advance

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,599
you might encounter some of that if it

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,000
makes you uncomfortable i have no hurt

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
feelings if you want to leave or need to

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
leave

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
that said here's one of them

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,519
17

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
in summer of 2018 in central europe

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
there's a woman who's been trafficked

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
most likely out of eastern europe

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
into central europe

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
and she decides

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,519
after being sent on a job

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,200
and being

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
abused and disfigured on that job that

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
she's done she's out

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
so she runs

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
she gets on a bus she gets a hold of

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
someone that then became my client

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,040
and asked for help

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
these guys run a small safe house

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
they've got social workers they've got

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
counselors help women find new jobs

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
after they've been forced into slavery

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
moved around the world and landing

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
somewhere away from their family away

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
from the support network that probably

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
abandoned them to begin with

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
and she goes there for help

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
well we'll skip over for the moment all

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
the opsec and open source intelligence

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,680
failures that were done uh or that led

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,480
to

94
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,080
basically the safe housing so she's run

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,599
from a gang it's organized

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
their email

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
and they figure out where the ceo lives

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,159
all this stuff and they decide that

99
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,120
they're going to send abusive image

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
material

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
to the email basically says we know who

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,760
you are we know you have her she belongs

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,439
to us you're hurting our bottom line

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,799
give her back or more people are going

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,840
to get hurt

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,519
then the social workers phones start

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,200
ringing

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
and this harassment campaign goes on for

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,959
a couple days and then somehow the

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
victim we don't know how she caught word

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,159
of it because they tried to keep it all

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,519
tight to the chest

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
catches wind of it flees back is

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
permanently injured put in the hospital

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
and we'll never look the same again

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
why do i tell that story not to be

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
emotionally heavy though it is an

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,040
emotionally heavy story it's hard to

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
tell

120
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,360
there are worse details in there

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
unfortunately

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,199
because

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
when we fail to do things like opsec

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,639
right we just say you signal use tor and

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,320
we talk about this

126
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,919
bro mentality

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
consequences to people in the world how

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
to follow that advice when it's not good

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
enough

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,199
when we don't do things like blocking

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
loading of external resources

132
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
getting someone's ip address

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
off of a safe house can quickly turn

134
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,759
into geolocation phishing that safe

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,320
house could be the same thing so what do

136
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,919
we do for the people who are out there

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,840
alone and unafraid who are in the field

138
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,039
they're getting their hands dirty

139
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
they're trying to help people and

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
they're too small to have an i.t team

141
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
they're too small to have a security

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
team they don't know

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
really what fishing is much less how to

144
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
stop it

145
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
and they certainly have the funds to

146
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
hire mandiant to come save them oh and

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
they're not journalists so where citizen

148
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
lab gonna be etc that's not to throw

149
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
shade on any of those companies but that

150
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
there's all of this malou out there of

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,199
people just trying to make the world a

152
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,560
better place

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
that are not being served

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,520
and that's where we come in

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
we exist to provide cyber security

156
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,680
support to people serving in dangerous

157
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,199
situations

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,440
our goal is them more effective at what

159
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
they do

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
instead of replacing them

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
i realize that they're not cyber

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
security experts

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
they realize that i'm not an activist

164
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
i'm not a missionary i'm not whatever

165
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
they are

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,919
so we form a relationship and we make

167
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
them a better version of what they were

168
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,680
in order to do that

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
i can't take this infosec attitude

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
where i walk in and infosec as a means

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,120
and it ends into itself

172
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,840
it must fundamentally be part of moving

173
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
the mission forward

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,759
so that's what we do at arika so now

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
it's time to tell some kind of fun

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
some of which are kind of weird we're

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,800
gonna

178
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
hard right turn

179
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
zoom in the beginning of 2020 does

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
anyone remember that it was actually 18

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
19 months ago

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,319
it wasn't yesterday believe it or not um

183
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,639
so in the middle east did anyone in here

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
pay attention to what happened in

185
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
various repressive middle eastern

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
regimes when kovit locked them down too

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
anyone see the news on that

188
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
vpns that were legal gray areas were

189
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,600
suddenly light gray instead

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
tools like zoom that were banned were

191
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,919
suddenly legal whatsapp legal status

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
changed a bunch signals legal status

193
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
changed a bunch next thing you know you

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
have people who are doing civil rights

195
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
advocacy as well as in in my case

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,919
christian missionaries reaching out

197
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
saying like hey these tools are suddenly

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
legal

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
but the communications department of the

200
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,560
government is also saying don't worry

201
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
the legal but we can still see

202
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
everything you're doing so where's

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
where's the truth at what's going on

204
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,639
well surely

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
zoom is good enough right their white

206
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
paper said they were into unencrypted it

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,120
won't get too much into what they're

208
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
doing now but we'll uh kind of harp on

209
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
where they were at beginning 2020. zoom

210
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
sees this opportunity they grab this

211
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
gigantic audience

212
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,319
and they're telling people that they're

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,280
safe

214
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
they're doing indian encryption so this

215
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
picture of the on the left is actually

216
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,199
what zoom was telling people

217
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
but in reality the way they were

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
implementing their crypto was resulting

219
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
in uh

220
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
exactly what was called like ecb ecb

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,720
mode was turned on so that means that

222
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
if you encrypted this picture of you

223
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
know the linux ping one

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
with ecb mode on you can still tell

225
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,639
it's the linux ping one it's just in

226
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,639
grayscale now that's real good crypto

227
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,919
right those of us who've done any kind

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,919
of crypto know that the pattern should

229
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,080
be totally observable but wait it gets

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,039
better because they were doing

231
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,120
end-to-end encryption right so the keys

232
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
were sealable which citizen lab proved

233
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
and what you're seeing on the far right

234
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
there is the citizen lab proved you

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
could intercept the keys

236
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
and once you intercepted the keys you

237
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
could watch the entire thing they did

238
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,000
have to capture the video and the audio

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
in two different channels though

240
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,240
so what does this mean if you're

241
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
any kind of person who

242
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,840
is just trying to use the tools that are

243
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,240
available

244
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
to get your job done when you can no

245
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,039
longer leave your house

246
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,679
and your job's somewhat risky

247
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,880
and the government's saying it's okay

248
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,839
but we can watch you and then the

249
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,958
corporations are saying don't worry

250
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
we've got your back but actually we

251
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,760
don't really care because we're just

252
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,839
trying to make money

253
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,760
i won't dig into these two vignettes too

254
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,279
much but we basically say that zoom is

255
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
not suitable for secrets

256
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
the reason we say that is one their

257
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,279
crypto sucks their architecture is

258
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
designed to allow them to intercept it

259
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
whenever they choose to and then if you

260
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
need proof of the pudding they said

261
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
they'd never do this and they did

262
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
so why am i talking about this because

263
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,399
purple dragons

264
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
here's dod you don't have to raise your

265
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
but

266
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
you recognize the purple dragon it's the

267
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
opsec talk

268
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,200
i checked unfortunately the d20 joke

269
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
purple dragon is not one of the

270
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,080
chromatic dragons and dungeons and

271
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,839
dragons so no such luck there

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
might be there

273
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,279
so we're gonna talk topic for a little

274
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,240
bit because this is a lot of what

275
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,399
consumed our time in 2020 and quite a

276
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,920
bit of our time in 2021. um

277
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
rule one i like to say is shut up which

278
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
is basically the same as loose lipstick

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
ships but that's not necessarily

280
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
position right

281
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
you accomplish

282
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,000
your mission if you never talk to

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
somebody especially if you're in a

284
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
people business probably not

285
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,040
your unhackable computer that's

286
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
unplugged in the corner and like a safe

287
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
great secure but it's not accomplishing

288
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
anything for your business

289
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
so clearly we have to find opsec model

290
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,760
that meets people where they're at

291
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
military

292
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
strictly

293
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
and it can't be unusable

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
well that's not easy

295
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,040
so one of the things we started doing is

296
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
trying to teach people what does it mean

297
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
to analyze your operation and to figure

298
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,360
out

299
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
opsec from the perspective of operation

300
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
security being a process that you do to

301
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
identify the vulnerabilities that are

302
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,079
fundamentally tied to your behavior and

303
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,279
the mission that you're trying to

304
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
accomplish

305
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,519
it's

306
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,920
a lot about identifying how is it when i

307
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
do something how does that advertise who

308
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
i am what i'm trying to accomplish and

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,079
how can that be exploited and then even

310
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,519
when it's not being exploited how can

311
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
that break

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but soapbox what is it not

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,040
it's not use signal use

314
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
okay those are good tools but what's the

315
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
problem with just jumping straight to

316
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,279
tools

317
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
people and processes are completely

318
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
removed

319
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,000
i see a bunch of you can tell who the

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
consultants in the room are yeah people

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,959
processes technology yeah

322
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
it's also not blanket advice it's not

323
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,959
never use facebook right

324
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
it's not never use zoom as much as like

325
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,120
i discourage the use of zoom it's it's

326
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
not to say you never can

327
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,279
you can't say whatsapp is owned by

328
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
facebook you should never touch it

329
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,440
insert your app of choice you can't say

330
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
protonmail finally cave to a government

331
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
so we can't use them anymore it's just

332
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
too complex for that

333
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
you also can't say always use open

334
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
source because again the teams you're

335
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
working with

336
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
have no i.t team so please explain to me

337
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
how you're going to deploy elastic

338
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
and manage it as everything's changing

339
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,800
without someone who even understands

340
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
what's happening under the hood at

341
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
alaska

342
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
also just kind of silly privacy advice

343
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
like can we just take a moment to

344
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
appreciate this is real advice this

345
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
bottom line you should never give out

346
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
your pet's name online now if your pet's

347
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
name is your password okay don't give it

348
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,240
out online but if you're smart enough

349
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
like not to use that as your recovery

350
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,680
question or your password

351
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,959
it's okay to let people know

352
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,639
there's a fundamental disconnect is what

353
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,079
i'm trying to say between what we see on

354
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,560
twitter between the tech pros and the

355
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,399
privacy bros and what people actually

356
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,920
need particularly outside of the western

357
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,200
world

358
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,639
so this is the framework that we've laid

359
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,920
out it's pretty straightforward

360
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
foundational understanding is just

361
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,399
basically how to use a computer what

362
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,839
does opsec mean how to write a mission

363
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,800
statement

364
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,079
and i'm going to dig into a couple of

365
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
these but i'll hit what they are for the

366
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
moment environmental analysis and threat

367
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,760
analysis are about the big four

368
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,519
questions of framing

369
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,480
what's going on in your area

370
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
where are you what does that area look

371
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
like and how does it impact what you're

372
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,160
doing

373
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,519
you'd be surprised that some people have

374
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,040
gone into areas that they're trying to

375
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,480
help and they haven't even asked the

376
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
question about how does where i live

377
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,720
impact the work that i'm going to do

378
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,200
how does the demographic that i most

379
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,279
interact with lock me out of other

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,639
demographics that i'm actually trying to

381
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
reach

382
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
next two big questions who are your

383
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,680
threats

384
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,200
this is where we start attacking the tin

385
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
foil because everyone thinks that nsa is

386
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
their threat everyone thinks that the

387
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
kgb is i don't know how hgb is not

388
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,320
technically around anymore but they're

389
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440
out there they're still still the

390
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
boogeyman still going to get me

391
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
but even more important once you know

392
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,200
who your threats are how are they going

393
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
to impact you and we'll dig into that in

394
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
just a minute

395
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
then we talk a little bit about

396
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
operational analysis if you can't

397
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
explain what you're doing

398
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
then you probably don't know how it's

399
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,839
going to break and you don't know how

400
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,120
someone's going to punch you in the face

401
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
and break it for you

402
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,959
and then we try to get into the most

403
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,440
simplified vulnerability management

404
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,120
process possible what could go wrong

405
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
model how it could

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
possible so that they're actually usable

407
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
so where i'm going to dig in a little

408
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,719
bit show like

409
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,600
time through and it takes even longer to

410
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
do i'm going to dig into part of

411
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,040
i'm going to vulnerability modeling and

412
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
vulnerability

413
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,600
just hit some weight stops

414
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
so don't worry about it the thing that i

415
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
want to highlight here is identifying

416
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
threats is a big part of how we do

417
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
security just period whether that's ops

418
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
or security if you want a model for how

419
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,519
to defend yourself

420
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,440
besides one that's focused on what you

421
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
have and how it's vulnerable you need to

422
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
understand how bad people want to hurt

423
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,399
you

424
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,319
categories of threats so they stayed

425
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,959
with a

426
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,959
international lawful unlawful how they

427
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
want to interact with you but the big

428
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
thing that we started discovering here

429
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,519
is you talk to people and they're like

430
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,360
i'm working in you know this country

431
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,160
near saudi um you pick one of the ones

432
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,360
in that region

433
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
and we think that the secret police are

434
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
out to get well secret please probably

435
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,480
put your office

436
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,519
you

437
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,199
for most people's threats when they're

438
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,639
out moving around and they have

439
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,680
sensitive

440
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
cell phones in their laptops and what do

441
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
i mean by that it's not necessarily

442
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,959
going through an airport though that is

443
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
one of the cases it's not necessarily

444
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
actually hitting a taliban

445
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,160
it's

446
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
i just got

447
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
material

448
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,120
father thinks is surreptitious or that i

449
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,000
shouldn't have on my cell phone

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
home

451
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
and because i'm a woman in this

452
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,519
environment

453
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
i don't have a right to privacy and my

454
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,040
brother took my phone

455
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
and my brother's the man so he gets to

456
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
have the password to my phone and he

457
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,720
unlocks it and he sees the material and

458
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,440
now i'm at risk for my life

459
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
so the thing we try to drive home people

460
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,639
here

461
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
is to take the tin foil hat off we'll

462
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
get there when we get there but also

463
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,759
someone wants to hit you with a missile

464
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,920
they're gonna get you calm down

465
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
like not much you can do about a threat

466
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,759
that's patient enough and well-resourced

467
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,759
enough to get you wherever you're at

468
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
what you can do though

469
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,079
is think about how the person next to

470
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,199
you

471
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,199
when you piss them off

472
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,959
is going to harm you

473
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
or is just going to report you or get

474
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
upset with you if you're really going to

475
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
get on this police's radar it's probably

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
going to be because someone just

477
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,800
got motivated to snitch on you

478
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
but then even more important than how do

479
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,680
i get

480
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,839
on that radar and how do i get hurt is

481
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,480
how do i push that risk off to someone

482
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
else and am i ever doing that to them

483
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,839
without their consent or informing them

484
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,680
of what's happening so when i put a

485
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
pamphlet when i put a bible on someone

486
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
else's phone where it's not supposed to

487
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
be

488
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
did i inform them of what i was signing

489
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,560
them up for what they were signing

490
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
themselves up for

491
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,920
and did i tell them

492
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,759
hide this in this particular way so that

493
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,920
the secret police don't get you and fail

494
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,519
to inform them that their dad is

495
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,120
probably really not going to like that

496
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,240
so that's why we talk through

497
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
identifying threats is because realistic

498
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
threats are so much more helpful for

499
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
building a defensive model and a

500
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,519
security model than just

501
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
i feel like i'm james bond and therefore

502
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
hydra or whoever's coming after me

503
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
i know mixing mixing

504
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
uh fandoms

505
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
so skipping over operational analysis

506
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,240
then we get down to vulnerabilities we

507
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
try to get like these are people that

508
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
don't understand cyber security not

509
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
because they're dumb if you if you

510
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,799
listen to any of the talks that we're

511
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,720
like about consulting

512
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,240
it's not because users are dumb it's

513
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
because users have built their expertise

514
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,160
come to them you've got to bring a model

515
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
to them that says i understand what

516
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,400
you're trying to accomplish and i want

517
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
to make this as usable for you as

518
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
possible so naturally in practice you're

519
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,679
going to be like way over technical and

520
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,600
then way under technical and you're just

521
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
going to kind of pin them around until

522
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
you actually get to something that they

523
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
understand and are going to use but kind

524
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,320
of walk through a couple examples of how

525
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,120
behaviors turn into compromises and

526
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,559
different things that could go wrong so

527
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,160
like someone taking a weekly trip to

528
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,840
somerville imagine that you're in

529
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,280
somewhere in southeast asia that has a

530
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,679
city in somerville that makes sense

531
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
and your whole team

532
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
in a van but somehow you want to keep

533
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
the fact that you're all a team a secret

534
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
so imagine the situation where like this

535
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,919
is a thing i want to keep protected

536
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,280
but i'm going to go get everybody in

537
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
this in the same van at the same time

538
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
and how that gives away the very thing

539
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,000
that you're potentially trying to

540
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
protect

541
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
information that's used or created by

542
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
the whole team getting in the van and

543
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,559
going to summerville together you get a

544
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,400
dinner and size of the team

545
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,880
also the time of your weekly trip

546
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,240
think through the assets and tools that

547
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,679
you're using whereas you're using your

548
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
van you're using your gps you're using

549
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,039
whatever else to get there and what are

550
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,120
the ways that it could go wrong

551
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
gas tank that could be a million

552
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,679
different things right you could just

553
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,280
run out of gas someone could actually do

554
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
something to it tire pressure

555
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
accidents as well as deliver sabotage

556
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
there

557
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
and then obviously getting spotted

558
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
traveling together

559
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
i'll zip through the next one and go

560
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,000
down to tracking the locals with the crm

561
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
this one unfortunately is kind of a real

562
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,960
case so

563
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,880
imagine like you're out there and you're

564
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,120
trying to make contacts with people in a

565
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
local area there's a couple different

566
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
use cases for this um the missionary one

567
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
is the most straightforward uh it's

568
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
evangelism motivated the activist one is

569
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
a little more complicated

570
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
because sometimes activists want to

571
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
build grassroots movements

572
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,039
how do you explain to someone with no

573
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,880
cyber security background

574
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,240
the danger of putting all of their

575
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,960
contacts for your surreptitious

576
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,520
operation in a contact and resource

577
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,799
manager

578
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,440
so that anyone can find it

579
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
especially when that's an excel sheet on

580
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
your unencrypted laptop

581
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
one of the ways we try to do that

582
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,679
is to get people to think about the

583
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,840
information that's created or destroyed

584
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
or that's used and processed when

585
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,559
they're behaving in a particular way

586
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,000
i don't necessarily need to jump them

587
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
straight to this is how it moves over

588
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,919
the wire and this is the type of cues i

589
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,679
need them to understand

590
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,200
that by walking down the street

591
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
something world around them and is that

592
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
something they want to communicate

593
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,399
something they don't want to communicate

594
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
teach three-time mitigation

595
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,760
mitigating control excuse me

596
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,159
as cyber security folks we like to jump

597
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,240
to the access that's why we preach

598
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
end-to-end encryption so much it's an

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
access control for data and transit and

600
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,480
in certain configurations it's somewhat

601
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
of a control for data at rest

602
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,799
unfortunately

603
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,640
when we preach that

604
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
we give people the idea that if i get

605
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
into an encrypted channel

606
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,919
i can run my mouth

607
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
and it will never have any consequences

608
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,760
so something that we try to help people

609
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,440
understand is there are two other types

610
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,240
of controls at least this may be over

611
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,520
find the model

612
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,840
but the first is

613
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,320
behavioral can i change what i'm doing

614
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,840
to get rid of the vulnerability

615
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,080
altogether

616
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
if i don't need port 22 facing the

617
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,200
internet can i turn it off

618
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
just because it came turned on on linux

619
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,640
by default do i really need it there

620
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
maybe maybe not

621
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
if i don't need to send that newsletter

622
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,120
with

623
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
everybody's information and all my

624
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
sensitive operations out to all of my

625
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
supporters then i don't do that maybe i

626
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,679
do need to send the newsletter but i

627
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,520
don't need to include that information

628
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
i don't have to worry about protecting

629
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
information that i don't have that i

630
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
don't collect i don't have to worry

631
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
about securing information in transit

632
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
that i don't send

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
so one of the easiest ways is to go back

634
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,559
to loose lip sync ships and say do i

635
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,080
really need to say this thing before i

636
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
say it going back to russell eumix talks

637
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
like what is essential to getting my

638
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,240
mission done right

639
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
do i need to say this to get my mission

640
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,880
done

641
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
or let's just steal a quote from robin

642
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
drake am i doing this to satisfy my ego

643
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,360
instead of to lead the team or to

644
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,320
accomplish the mission

645
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
they're all about people that have

646
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,559
access to information access information

647
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,159
people in this room probably understand

648
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,240
those really really well it's everything

649
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
from acls to cryptography

650
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,200
but analysis

651
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,480
things get a little like funky

652
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,880
because that means assuming breach how

653
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
do we make the information unusable to

654
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,159
an adversary and that's very very hard

655
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,919
to do and still keep it simple and

656
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,280
usable

657
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
so we don't actually see a lot of

658
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
counter analysis controls

659
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,600
because it's really hard for someone

660
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
without a lot of resources and time to

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
keep moving forward

662
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
that's where

663
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,840
but big takeaways from this build small

664
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
and usable litigations like if i if i

665
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
try to jump someone from not even

666
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,360
understanding that behavior has

667
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
consequences to like

668
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,360
running some super secret squirrel like

669
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
security stack

670
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
without the time or money to do that i'm

671
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,000
probably not giving them something

672
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,280
that's actually going to implement it i

673
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,799
can lay out the best plan in the world

674
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,159
but if it's too hard if it's too

675
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,960
unusable it's not getting put into place

676
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,640
mitigations that you can remember

677
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
particularly when it comes to behaviors

678
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,000
are better than complex solutions

679
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
i'm sure all of us have like

680
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
been in a job somewhere where they're

681
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,440
like this is the whole security process

682
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
and you're like can't remember it not

683
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,159
doing it

684
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
no one says that on purpose but you get

685
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,120
into the moment you're like what was it

686
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,640
again oh yeah go out the left door and

687
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,679
they're like actually it was out the

688
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,120
right door up the stairs down the stairs

689
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,679
turn around the building three times

690
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,120
and then finally this is something that

691
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,280
i personally struggle with

692
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
osec does as well as don't let perfect

693
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
be the enemy of good

694
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,919
we have a really big problem with that

695
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
at infosec it's that oh well sms is bad

696
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,280
for two-factor and yes it is

697
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
but if you're in africa it's your only

698
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,720
option

699
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,200
is it better to have no two factor or

700
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,799
sms two factor

701
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,000
there's a lot of us walking around on

702
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
the internet be like well you know they

703
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
could hijack your sim card and then

704
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,600
where's your two packers gonna be then

705
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,279
you know what they had to do

706
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,200
they had to hijack the sim card

707
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
and if you had a weak password without

708
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
that two factor on there they didn't

709
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,679
even have to do that

710
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,360
so going back and stealing some ideas

711
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
from military philosophy extending

712
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,640
the cost or expanding the cost that the

713
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
enemy has to pay the adversary has to

714
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
pay to get at you

715
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,439
with simple and small things

716
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
tell a couple stories here on consulting

717
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
so that's all like opsec training side

718
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,400
so then we'll take kind of a turn here

719
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
and talk about consulting which is

720
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,679
for us is teaching people how to build a

721
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,520
cyber security program where one doesn't

722
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,918
exist

723
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
starts with helping people understand

724
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,600
the need for a cyber security program

725
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,400
a couple

726
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
ideas up here on the slide that we run

727
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
into pretty consistently we don't need a

728
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
cyber security program if they break in

729
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,320
they can only steal emails

730
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,039
we have monetized cyber security to such

731
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
an extent

732
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,600
that people are stuck in a mindset of

733
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,919
preventing monetary loss

734
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,240
and when you change the context into a

735
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
small altruistic non-profit organization

736
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,000
they then see i don't have any money so

737
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,159
i don't have any money to lose therefore

738
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,960
cyber security is not a risk

739
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,720
but when you talk about the information

740
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,440
in exchange for these guys it's the

741
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,039
location of people in the field it's

742
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
location of local partners it's people

743
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
that can get hurt if it gets out

744
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,960
and so you dig in and kind of help them

745
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,480
understand that so okay well what

746
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,679
happens to your operation in indonesia

747
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,440
if this information gets leaked oh well

748
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,400
i have to shut it down and bring

749
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
everyone home

750
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,039
okay

751
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,679
so now we have something to protect

752
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,039
it's not something to hide it's not

753
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,879
necessarily money to keep in our pockets

754
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
people to enable

755
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,279
developers

756
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,600
love to say that they built it right

757
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
and they configured it right i see you

758
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,320
guys say

759
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
therefore it is secure

760
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,559
so how do you know if someone's knocking

761
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,720
on your door if you

762
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
don't have a door doorbell and you never

763
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,919
like listen at your door to hear if

764
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,200
someone's knocking

765
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
so we've seen a lot of people put up

766
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
like web servers and custom web apps and

767
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
all this other stuff and it's secure we

768
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,600
built it right also it's only accessible

769
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
over port 443 it's running https we're

770
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,039
good

771
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,520
never run a phone scanner never looked

772
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,880
at and there's certainly no monitoring

773
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,840
in place

774
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,919
so now we have to back up and not only

775
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
understand that there's something and

776
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,799
someone to protect but that there's kind

777
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,720
of some simple steps small disciplines

778
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
we can start taking in order to keep

779
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,039
ourselves safe the first is

780
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,640
once you build it then let's start like

781
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
routinely scanning it and checking it to

782
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,360
see if it still behaves the way that we

783
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,880
think it behaves

784
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
security at its simplest

785
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
is finding misbehaviors in the system

786
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,440
so if we build the system right like we

787
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,960
said we did then we probably have

788
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,880
documented how it should behave and we

789
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,200
can look for those small departures and

790
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
somewhere in those departures of how the

791
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,279
correct behavior and misbehavior is the

792
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,080
bad guy if they're there

793
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,279
it's cuckoo's egg level stuff

794
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,440
another misconception we run into is the

795
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
money question when it comes to

796
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,360
ransomware so rents

797
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,039
money that doesn't mean they don't care

798
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,360
about you just because you're broke

799
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,960
a lot of them are also opportunistic

800
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,799
but you know just because you don't have

801
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,240
the three million dollar pot to give

802
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,360
them doesn't mean they won't take

803
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
seventeen thousand empty your bank

804
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,400
account and walk away

805
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
uh ransomware also is super fascinating

806
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,240
did you guys ever think you know three

807
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,080
four years ago reading about ransomware

808
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,520
you'd be reading discussions about

809
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,039
ransomware's business model in 2021

810
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,440
that in in 2020 and 2021 that we would

811
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
see this the term ransomware as a

812
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,039
service pop up

813
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,720
like these guys have better business

814
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,120
models than most of us

815
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,600
and their customer service will put most

816
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,720
infosec people to shame

817
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,760
so they will take what money you have

818
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,679
and then either run away with the keys

819
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,200
if you're too broke or

820
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
get you back online and let someone else

821
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,960
come in and come in a different day

822
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,480
what's my point in all this there's

823
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
there's a mind shift change has to

824
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,120
happen as a security practitioner you

825
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
are not here

826
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720
to get your ego off

827
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
you're not here to show how cool and

828
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
sexy cyber security is you're here to

829
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,399
take care of somebody you're here to

830
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,000
make someone else's business function

831
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,879
and then

832
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,840
cheaper than a breach is failing people

833
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,960
if you look at marketing out there has

834
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
anyone ever seen that like on the

835
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,480
internet like you know cyber security br

836
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
we don't actually say well i'm cheaper

837
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
than a breach but we say breaches cost

838
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
people 50 million dollars a year and i

839
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
only cost 1 million dollars a year i

840
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
don't know about you guys but my bank

841
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,159
account doesn't support one million

842
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,799
dollars a year or 50 or 50 million

843
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
so clearly something's got to give

844
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
somewhere in there and

845
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,159
insert a small talk about our funding

846
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,000
model at this point

847
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
one of the reasons we exist is to help

848
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,960
the people who can't afford the big

849
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,559
companies to do it

850
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,159
so we come in and we try to give a fair

851
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,919
rate that's you know at actual cyber

852
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,760
security rate we come into the bottom

853
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,720
quartile every time by design and it's

854
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,799
still sticker shock for most people

855
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,240
because their frame of reference is the

856
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,679
guy they hired to write the wordpress

857
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,440
blog that then didn't get secured for

858
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,320
them

859
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,240
and it's not you know any kind of

860
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
cybersecurity consulting much less

861
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
instant response rates if you guys have

862
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,720
looked at instant response rates on the

863
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
market they are prohibitively high for

864
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
most small medium companies much less

865
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,320
non-profits

866
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,880
so then we you know small pitch into how

867
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,159
we get that done we then go to our

868
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,760
donors and we say there's a gap between

869
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
what we want to make so that we can stay

870
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
alive and what the client can afford

871
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
because they have no money so how do we

872
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,000
get the client up to where the project

873
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,120
should be appropriately priced

874
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,960
which leads us into one of the things

875
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
that we do it's network monitoring for

876
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,360
safe houses um sometimes call this the

877
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
itty bitty mssp you've got some other

878
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
names for it internally that are more

879
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,279
fun

880
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,720
but the idea is if you're running a

881
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,399
small safe house

882
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,279
where

883
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,799
protecting the geolocation is part of

884
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,960
what your network needs to do

885
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
spotting threats that are crossing your

886
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,320
perimeter is part of what it needs to do

887
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,159
and then selectively managing the

888
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,679
content so that

889
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,600
you're not a prison you're trying to

890
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,039
teach people about freedom and get them

891
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,000
back on their feet and do

892
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,360
self-determination all these great

893
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
things but you don't want certain

894
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,039
content particularly that related to

895
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,760
malware um getting through to you or to

896
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
the people you're housing

897
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,559
so what we do in some cases this is a

898
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
very selective thing we're talking about

899
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,360
we put a managed firewall out there that

900
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,799
runs some nids and also does some

901
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,799
obfuscation and content filtering and

902
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,120
enables us basically to be a layer

903
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
between them and the internet and this

904
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,399
was designed with that first vignette in

905
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,640
mind that i threw out there of

906
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,919
when

907
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,440
someone sends an email that should have

908
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
been a phishing email

909
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,360
what have you done one to like just turn

910
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
atp on in their extreme server but

911
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,679
because in office 365 by the way if

912
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,360
those are unfamiliar

913
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,440
non-profits can get a discounted rate

914
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,520
that can get them atp so if you do any

915
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,360
consulting like even you know just

916
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,559
someone's like hey i'm a friend i'm in a

917
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,480
non-profit what should i do

918
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,039
turn on atp if you're using 365 and then

919
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,640
if you're in google workspaces they have

920
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
an equivalent product go in make sure

921
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,519
it's turned on

922
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,360
but past that level

923
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
we come in we actually do some stuff for

924
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,799
them to try to protect that so this is

925
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,240
where again is some of the tech stuff

926
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,480
and uml diagrams and whatnot not super

927
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,360
interesting

928
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,120
but this is how we get it done so on the

929
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
on the left hand side we have the stack

930
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,640
of log collection so down on the

931
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
endpoints we're pulling logs off disk

932
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
we're feeding them up into

933
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,159
um

934
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,720
aws aws s3 using kinesis fire hoses

935
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,240
dump stuff basically coming straight off

936
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,440
those firewalls straight off those

937
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,039
sensors into well-structured s3 buckets

938
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,880
which we can then use amazon athena

939
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
which is their implementation of parquet

940
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,039
to read those file structures as if they

941
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,039
were a sql database so if i'm pulling

942
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,720
most cyber security data it's

943
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,640
fundamentally well structured most of

944
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
the cases

945
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,640
so i can store it in a well schema

946
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,320
relational database

947
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,120
and

948
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,240
you know combine it together in

949
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,679
different ways this is where i go with

950
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,039
like zeek is actually a relational

951
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,919
database and a bunch of text files

952
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,840
on the flip side though

953
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,919
okay so we thought about

954
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,559
pulling a certain cloud approach

955
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,480
and stopping with logs and running

956
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
decision trees and doing all this

957
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,600
machine learning stuff but then we

958
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
realized that that's the top of the

959
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,320
pyramid of pain we have no business

960
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,519
being there instead let's get some ioc

961
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,200
feeds and i'll share some free ones for

962
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,679
you guys on the next couple slides and

963
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
say like what if we have two pipes for

964
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
iocs one is analysts have been doing

965
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,000
hunting on the data let's feed it into

966
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,760
the stack from what the analyst decided

967
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
the signature should be and start

968
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,039
creating alerts from that and the other

969
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
is let's just pull the free and

970
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,360
trustworthy feeds uh into the system and

971
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,880
put them in their own databases and

972
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,519
start doing simple matching and then

973
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,600
then at our edge where people are coming

974
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
out of the system we can start blocking

975
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,000
things that are bad and updating the the

976
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,799
filter lists in the block list

977
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,640
that also there's some web hook magic in

978
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
there with git and not but it ultimately

979
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,519
ends up in a database in parquet athena

980
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,799
and then

981
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,399
for those who aren't familiar

982
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,159
sometimes a nid's alert is as simple as

983
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,080
a sql join

984
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,360
it's a lot of what's actually happening

985
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,799
under the hood in most cases there's

986
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,600
some rug x and other nonsense in there

987
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,799
and then that feeds to an analyst you

988
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
can make a decision on it and that

989
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,880
ultimately can go to again the blocking

990
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
part or the notifying the customer

991
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,200
what's going on

992
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,519
when we talk about some of the things

993
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,720
we're interested in researching

994
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
ichart of a slide this is just a proof

995
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
of concept that if i access tor over it

996
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,799
i can take a feed of tor nodes and prove

997
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,200
that someone is doing that

998
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
tor is a good use case of something that

999
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,559
most networks

1000
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,960
don't need access to unless there's like

1001
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
an actual anonymity case out there

1002
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
somewhere

1003
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,440
um

1004
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,799
so yeah just a simple thing that you can

1005
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,559
block and also a really easy thing to

1006
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,559
detect when it happens in this case

1007
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,480
we're matching based on a known list of

1008
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,799
tor nodes but tor's network signature in

1009
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,799
most cases is like by default it's

1010
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,559
really easy to spot as well so we have

1011
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,880
another hunt we can just use all that

1012
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,919
stuff straight at the surface

1013
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
some free feeds i'll pause here if you

1014
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,840
guys want to take a

1015
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,679
slide

1016
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,200
but there's a lot of good stuff out

1017
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
there there's a lot of noisy stuff out

1018
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,839
there too if you've ever used emerging

1019
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,918
threats open rules they are great and

1020
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,679
they are not tuned

1021
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,280
um if you want reputational information

1022
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,960
check out umbrella's top one million

1023
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,359
snort puts out a good ip block list dan

1024
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,399
dot me

1025
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,040
has like five or six different great

1026
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,599
sets of like this just informative lists

1027
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,960
everything from

1028
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,119
um tour list to bad reputation scan

1029
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,800
a lot of similar information so does

1030
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,359
lsde

1031
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,599
to a free ioc fee for phishing check out

1032
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480
open fish and then sansei um that should

1033
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
be

1034
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,480
isc yeah internet storm center uh pardon

1035
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
that um

1036
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,839
has a bunch of stuff as well under the

1037
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,839
tools and data sections of their website

1038
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,199
so you don't just have to listen to

1039
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,399
their podcast you actually get their

1040
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,879
data too

1041
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
where i'm going with that and then we'll

1042
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,040
kind of land the talk here

1043
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
um coming back to

1044
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
use cases

1045
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,480
that infosec is not handling well

1046
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,760
stalkerware in 2020 saw a huge spike in

1047
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,040
use in domestic abuse cases

1048
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,400
where this overlaps with me as i'm

1049
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
concerned with anti-trafficking

1050
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,720
control of accounts is one of the number

1051
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
one ways to monitor a victim of

1052
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,079
anti-trafficking the handler otherwise

1053
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,920
known as the pimp will control access to

1054
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,359
the google account control access to the

1055
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,880
phone they don't need stock aware

1056
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,920
because they can just open the phone and

1057
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,359
read what's going on they can track my

1058
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,880
iphone whatever and see what's going on

1059
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,040
but as we see this increase in domestic

1060
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
abuse which shares ttps for control and

1061
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,839
monitoring we can reason that it will

1062
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,359
eventually find its way into the

1063
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,839
anti-trafficking

1064
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,720
space so

1065
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,520
clearly the info

1066
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,880
only tied to people being harmed

1067
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
already in domestic abuse space and may

1068
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,079
be tied to more harm in the future

1069
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,880
unfortunately this is an area

1070
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,240
that we're

1071
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,599
totally

1072
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,560
missing the mark on

1073
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
previous research going back to as early

1074
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,640
as 2018 that i can find at this point

1075
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,839
basically shows that if you put this

1076
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,359
stuff in a virus total if you put this

1077
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,440
stuff in any kind of virus scanner they

1078
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,079
will almost always come back clean

1079
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,720
these are the manufacturers of four

1080
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,520
different types of uh stalkerware

1081
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
and you can see there's 86 detection in

1082
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,200
virus community edition by default

1083
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
and only two of these just distribution

1084
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,560
domains malware distribution domains get

1085
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,359
flagged as any type of suspicious and if

1086
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,359
you were to squint at the slide you

1087
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,400
would see that

1088
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
the worst that any of these get labeled

1089
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,119
is potentially unwanted program that's

1090
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,200
adware that's not that bad i mean it's

1091
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
annoying it could be used to serve

1092
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,520
malware but it's just adware

1093
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,359
and then even worse most of these are

1094
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,640
i.t tools

1095
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,599
or mobile communication tools

1096
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,920
you have a whole segment of commodity

1097
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,400
malware out there that's being treated

1098
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,880
like it has legitimate purpose even as

1099
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,839
companies like google

1100
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,880
and then a lot of the human rights

1101
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,560
organizations effs actually on board

1102
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
with this with stock aware coalition are

1103
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,079
saying like this is bad this is being

1104
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,160
used to literally hurt people we've got

1105
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
to stop doing this and the infosec

1106
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
community she's like nah

1107
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,560
telecommunication tools

1108
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
in their defense though some of the

1109
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,440
actual apks and whatnot involved in this

1110
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,200
do flag a little bit higher i think the

1111
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
highest i saw at any of these though uh

1112
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,520
was like 36 out of 86

1113
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,440
so they're still under a 50 detection

1114
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,000
rate for like the actual binary doing

1115
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,599
the dirty work

1116
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,440
there is some good news though their c2

1117
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,359
sucks

1118
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,160
it sucks it really does so these guys do

1119
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,720
not do anything to obfuscate

1120
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,560
once it's installed on the machine it's

1121
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
typically running as a background

1122
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,560
service and from there they're like

1123
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,920
we're not malware we have nothing to

1124
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,440
hide no one thinks we're malware we

1125
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,119
don't need to do this so what that means

1126
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,280
is the command control server is often

1127
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
provided by the service owner

1128
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
what that means is

1129
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,160
their c2 one is arrogant and it's really

1130
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
really obvious it's like spotting signal

1131
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,920
on a network if you're running a pcap

1132
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,119
super clear

1133
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,800
self-provided c2 actually means the

1134
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,040
distribution domain is often the c2

1135
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,079
domain

1136
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,160
so if i can figure out who's making it i

1137
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,320
can figure out how to spot it on nits

1138
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,079
we've also got some iocs for the actual

1139
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,520
binaries and whatnot so this is an

1140
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,440
example of some iocs we've collected for

1141
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,839
the community um you know excel table

1142
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,560
and whatnot port this up into our

1143
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
cloudnids and then we can see when we

1144
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,480
simulate traffic across it

1145
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,720
because they're using their own domains

1146
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,160
we can spot it really simply and then

1147
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
also if you wanted like a one-stop shop

1148
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
for tracking stock aware on the wire

1149
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,240
watch domain name uh dns requests for

1150
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,400
the word spy just put like an asterisk

1151
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
on either side of that you will find so

1152
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,079
much of these guys because they're so

1153
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,920
just like what we spy on people what's

1154
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,599
wrong with that

1155
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,119
well fortunately for us we can find it

1156
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,640
we can block it really easily and then

1157
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,000
some of them actually have

1158
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,960
obfuscated names

1159
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,400
yeah coming close to the end of the time

1160
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,520
so

1161
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
i'm going to stop there i've got more

1162
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
stories to share if you guys like want

1163
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,040
more you can come talk to me

1164
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,839
it's kind of

1165
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,720
security and it was taken

1166
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,320
we turned it into latin and we're still

1167
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,599
here

1168
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,680
things that we need though

1169
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,720
right now we're doing a lot of

1170
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
consulting

1171
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,800
to do with volunteers who don't have

1172
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,720
time during the day because your clients

1173
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,759
need to see you when they're

1174
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,320
when you

1175
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,400
look at applications and networks not

1176
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,359
just people on facebook stalking

1177
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,320
drop sec we need people to communicate

1178
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,760
we

1179
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,920
could really use a volunteer coordinator

1180
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
and then obviously

1181
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
there's those curious we are a 501c3 if

1182
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,440
you are so inclined

1183
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,040
um so i'm going to stop here i do have

1184
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,880
some giveaways and i would love to take

1185
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,040
your questions there are the full calls

1186
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,119
stefan what is the most

1187
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,400
the most rewarding thing that we've seen

1188
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,160
is when someone picked up a security

1189
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,599
like

1190
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,319
themselves so we saw like the story

1191
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,839
about the woman who was

1192
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,400
harmed

1193
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
completely transform

1194
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,079
security they just recently started a

1195
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
new on

1196
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,560
as more trafficking has gone online

1197
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
they've kind of followed it like in tech

1198
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,760
funnel

1199
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
and instead of being like hey we're

1200
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,040
doing this now let's go bolt on some

1201
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,119
security they've now switched into this

1202
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,960
idea of like this needs to be in the

1203
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,119
design process and in that regard

1204
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,400
they're actually showing more maturity

1205
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,839
than some like software development

1206
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,760
teams

1207
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,920
yes sir

1208
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,560
yes sir

1209
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,280
so we no longer do pro bono work but we

1210
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,520
do highly subsidize work

1211
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,880
um

1212
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,359
what we learned is this is the

1213
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,960
life straw story

1214
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
is people that receive work for free

1215
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,520
don't typically care about it till

1216
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,880
they're scared

1217
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,720
and security requires people to put in

1218
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,000
work up front

1219
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,599
so all that said we do stuff that's very

1220
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,119
highly discounted um down to almost free

1221
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,359
but we don't do completely free

1222
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,440
and we do mostly work for other

1223
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,319
non-profits and missionary organizations

1224
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,640
my two most active projects right now

1225
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,480
are missionary organizations and then

1226
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,880
i've got two ongoing reoccurring things

1227
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,480
with small anti-traffickers one in

1228
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,720
europe one in the united states and then

1229
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,599
looking at my upcoming projects i've got

1230
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,880
a couple more missionary ones in the

1231
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
pipe and then i've got a couple for

1232
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,240
for-profit sustainability ones and

1233
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,119
that's the other side of how we do fund

1234
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,839
some for profit work to make that risk

1235
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,920
margin by like taking people who can't

1236
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,520
afford to pay what the project is worth

1237
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,079
on we go like do some for-profit stuff

1238
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,599
we don't take home all that money it

1239
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,200
stays in the bank so that we can

1240
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,720
continue to do work when people can only

1241
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,759
pay five dollars a month

1242
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,480
yes sir

1243
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,560
yeah

1244
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,640
yeah so i i look for

1245
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,720
two hours a week

1246
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,319
as kind of the minimum commitment um it

1247
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,839
sounds like a lot

1248
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,599
and well actually i think it sounds like

1249
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,040
a little bit but

1250
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,280
it's usually a kind of high bar for

1251
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,720
people to actually hit but we want them

1252
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,319
to average there instead of you know

1253
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,720
that always be the case um and then for

1254
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,960
the consultants we really need people

1255
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
who can jump on something last minute

1256
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
and do background research at a minimum

1257
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,800
so anywhere from you know eight to ten

1258
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,560
hours a month averaging out somewhere

1259
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,079
around two hours a week

1260
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,079
for people who end up on the the knits

1261
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,560
project it could be a little bit lower

1262
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,400
because it's more asynchronous

1263
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
and it can kind of just keep pushing the

1264
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,520
ball forward without having to be

1265
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,880
involved in like actually working with

1266
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,280
clients

1267
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,520
yes sir

1268
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,520
yes and no um so we've done that once so

1269
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,680
far and it worked really really well

1270
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,359
we plan to do it again in the future

1271
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,520
what where we're at with the internship

1272
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,920
program is figuring out what maturity

1273
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,960
level we need and

1274
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,880
frankly speaking when it comes to like

1275
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,119
leading a client engagement most college

1276
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,760
kids aren't quite ready for that yet but

1277
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,119
they still can be helpful by being on

1278
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,400
those calls and helping do some of the

1279
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,000
writing and researching

1280
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,119
um

1281
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,400
so

1282
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,560
the the short answer is yes the long

1283
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,480
answer is it's in progress and so not

1284
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,520
quite yet

1285
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,040
but hopefully by the time next summer

1286
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,560
break rolls around we'll have our our

1287
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,359
stuff together for that

1288
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,599
we have not yet fortunately um and i

1289
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,440
think part of that is a a factor of

1290
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
being in the background uh and working

1291
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,760
for those organizations instead of like

1292
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,880
being out actually doing the work

1293
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
ourselves

1294
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,240
after

1295
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,839
down and grab one of these two

1296
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,760
simple answer we've been fortunate so

1297
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,920
far

1298
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,720
okay and then
