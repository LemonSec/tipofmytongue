good morning to the morning everybody

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,960
thank you for having us uh we appreciate

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,640
the invitation to come out and speak um

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,160
before we get started let me just kind

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,840
of put out there that this is really

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,560
intended to be a discussion

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,879
there's a good likelihood that they will

9
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,160
either as a victim or as a partner

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
any number of reasons so

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,200
we hope that you'll ask questions you'll

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,079
engage with us and uh we'll prompt you

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,440
that we'll get you out before the other

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,239
two

15
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,360

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,280
chick-fil-a

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,000
my name is brian i am the supervisor

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
here in the augusta office so i

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
supervise a team of agents both

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,520
in statesboro i cover about 26 counties

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
we also have in the room fortunately uh

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
todd renner he supervises the cyber one

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
of the cyber squads in atlanta uh he

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,920
didn't realize i was gonna point him out

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
but it is it is great that he's here

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
because the way the fbi and i'll talk

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
about this in just a few minutes we're

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
kind of we're organized geographically

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
but also by

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,520
so there's a there's a reason that he

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
now coordinate uh

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
almost on a daily basis certainly on a

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
weekly basis uh to help provide

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
support for the cyber community here in

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
augusta and with that i'll

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,479
like introduce himself and then we'll

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,720
get started so good afternoon or good

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,399
morning everyone i'm mike capacity i

39
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,200
work for adp i'm the senior director for

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
fraud detection and strategy

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
prior to that i ran 24 7 incident

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
response and detection for adp and

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
before that i was involved with dod for

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
a while most of you a lot of people in

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,399
the room knew me at various parts of my

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,759
career

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
i want to remind everybody that even

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
though brian and i have roles and we

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
have employers we are speaking here as

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,079
ourselves

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,239
and even if our employer should happen

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,919
to agree with us that's nothing we can

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
control

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,080
it's very important

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,879
say something stupid i don't want to be

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,239
fired

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,760
all right so we'll get started let's

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,959
kind of talk

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
briefly

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
really

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
maybe

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
all right so question who is law

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
enforcement when do you deal with law

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
enforcement law enforcement generally

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
just divided into three types of

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,319
organizations federal you've got

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
obviously fbi you've got secret service

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
and then almost every federal agency has

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
some law enforcement component

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
associated with it i think there's even

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,319
one for the department of education

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
they go down to state this is kind of a

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
georgia focus but in georgia you have

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
the georgia bureau of investigation in

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,640
some states you're going to find you

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,159
have state police agencies that fill

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,319
that role and then at the local level

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
you have a county sheriff or a police

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,879
department you have some sort of

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
superior court organization that's going

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
to deal with local crimes

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,319
state crimes and then federal crimes

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,319
and this is important because when you

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,000
decide you're going to involve law

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
enforcement

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,159
who can help you who's available who's

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,000
going to have interest in your case

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you know who can drive down and actually

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
visit your site if that's necessary or

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,400
visit the site where the crime occurred

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
or visit the data center where the crime

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,840
occurred so there's lots of nuance to

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
this and it's important for us as law

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
enforcement that we all

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,799
we we work with with the fbi i work with

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
everybody on that list very close

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
when we talk to you all about

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,879
it's not you know certainly there's

99
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,080
certain things that we definitely want

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
you to reach out to the fbi first but

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
we're never going to discourage you from

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
reaching out to locals if that's if you

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,599
have that relationship already

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,519
established it's incumbent on me and my

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
office to make sure i then have those

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
partnerships with the local law

107
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
enforcement or the gbi that they know

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
hey this may be larger than something we

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
can handle or this may not be

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,319
jurisdictionally something that we're

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
able to help with so then they would

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
come to me and then we would assist them

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,799
as well so this is just kind of a just

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
to let you know there's a there's a

115
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
large law enforcement population um

116
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
but you should build those those

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,359
partnerships at all levels if you can

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,720
so

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
it gets a little tricky in the federal

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,919
system here

121
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,520
a lot of different organizations i mean

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
there's a lot of organizations uh affect

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
dod nsa here locally that you hear about

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
you you know they're involved in in

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
cyber cyber warfare cyber threats so

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,680
what do they what do they actually do

127
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
and how do we work together it's it's

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
not as simple and this is probably a

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
difficult chart to read but i'll kind of

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
explain it to you in simple terms dhs is

131
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,440
more on the protection side

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
infrastructure

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,759
they

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
they try to mitigate and recover

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
dod nsa that's the national security

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
side obviously you know they're the war

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
fighters offense and defensive

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
protection of the united states they do

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
a lot more international and then you

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
have the fbi doj

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
attribution if we have victims here in

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,759
the united states trying to figure out

143
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,520
where that victimization came from who

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
the identify who the bad actors are if

145
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
it's something we can prosecute then

146
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
working directly with doj so that we can

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
either get some sort of restitution or

148
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
or criminal uh prosecution on those

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
individuals that that's you know that's

150
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
a very broad that's how the federal kind

151
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,720
of system

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
works

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,479
and i'm not going to read we have a

154
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,840
cyber mission

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
for the fbi is broad uh the biggest

156
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
thing we're trying to do is bring uh

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
world-class capabilities so that we can

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
we can basically

159
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
take bad actors and try to prevent them

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
from hitting us in the united states we

161
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,039
can't always prosecute

162
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,479
folks i mean a lot of times you know

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,960
this is often unclassified briefing so i

164
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
can't go into a lot of detail about

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
nation states or or some of the things

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,120
that that they're doing but

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
where we can't prosecute we want to try

168
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
to deter

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
and we bring a lot of resources we have

170
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,479
a

171
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,800
tremendous team of folks

172
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
both in atlanta and then locally that

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
will work with your organization to try

174
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,960
to identify and and try to prevent

175
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
those these crimes before they happen so

176
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
that you can you cannot become a victim

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but if you are we also give you

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
mechanisms to try to recover and and

179
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
prosecute

180
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
so the fbi is kind of structured

181
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
we have 56 field offices throughout the

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
united states georgia's covered by one

183
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
field office that's atlanta but there's

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
14 resident agencies like mark talked

185
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
about the augusta office the reason why

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
we have these resident agencies so you

187
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
can build these personal relationships

188
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
with the folks in the local geography so

189
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
i you know my goal is to know everybody

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
in here so you guys can you know see my

191
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
name if something comes up if you get if

192
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
you become a victim of a crime and it's

193
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,479
cyber related i want you to be able to

194
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
call me i want you to be able to to

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
reach out to the local fbi if i can't

196
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
handle it locally if it's something

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
that's above the capabilities and we do

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
have cyber agents here that are very

199
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
capable but if it's something that we

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
can't handle we have the resources of

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
the atlanta division we also have our

202
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,319
headquarters element and if you look at

203
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,199
this map those are our offices across

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,000
the world we have legal attaches so if

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
there's a bad actor in another country

206
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
we have the ability to reach back to

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,759
those countries and try to work with

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360
their law enforcement to get whatever

209
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
you know whatever

210
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,840
prosecution or or recovery we can do so

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,160
and these cases they've moved very fast

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,120
so

213
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
we have to have this flexibility and

214
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,639
have to have these resources already in

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,039
place to have any chance to be able to

216
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,919
make the recoveries

217
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
so what do you what can you expect from

218
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
us i mean this is really the big

219
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
question people are always reluctant the

220
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
thing that we find within law

221
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
enforcement especially the fbi's a lot

222
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,960
of times victims don't want to come to

223
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
us because they're worried about you

224
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
know is it going to look bad for them is

225
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,800
this going to be are we just looking to

226
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
put it on tv are we going to publicize

227
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,879
this and that's not the case we're going

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
to make every effort to to help the

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
victim and that's

230
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
minimizing downtime minimizing the time

231
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
that your organization is not

232
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
operational because clearly that's going

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
to be your number one priority how long

234
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,479
if you get hit by ransomware or or or

235
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,280
something that shuts your network down

236
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,639
we're going to try to get in there we're

237
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,840
going to try to collect evidence we're

238
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
going to try to do it in a way that that

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,360
minimizes your

240
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,839
exposure your downtime we're also going

241
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,919
to make every every effort to work with

242
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,559
you in terms of of media relationships

243
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
not every case is gonna the news but

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
obviously some like colonial pipeline

245
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,959
was one recently and and i know todd has

246
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
worked a number of of big cases where as

247
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
soon as they

248
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
you know as soon as they happen you know

249
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
they could have national implications so

250
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
we're going to work with your folks to

251
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,279
try to minimize any kind of

252
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
publicity that that you're not looking

253
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,959
for we also want to keep the victims

254
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
informed what we do throughout our

255
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,760
investigation is is work with the

256
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,360
whatever level of the organization you

257
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
want us to whether that's the the cio

258
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
level or or the implementation level

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
we'll make sure that we're talking to

260
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
them and we're keeping them informed of

261
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
the actions that we're doing and what

262
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,279
we're saying

263
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
and then the only negative that we do

264
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
have is a lot of times our cases can be

265
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
lengthy uh most

266
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,160
fbi federal cases they're not they're

267
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
not

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
they're not quick turn operations they

269
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
take a lot of resources and they can

270
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
tend to be launched we would we try to

271
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
keep you informed throughout that but

272
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,519
but some of them can last several years

273
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,720
if if that's

274
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
how long it takes to get the results

275
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
we're looking for okay

276
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
i keep getting off

277
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,839
i just think the computer doesn't like

278
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,640
me okay so one of the important things

279
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
to remember when you have a cyber event

280
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
that takes place on your premises is

281
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
that there's actually three locations

282
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,680
that are in play

283
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
there's the data center where the

284
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,279
malicious activity occurred there's

285
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
where the victim of the crime if you

286
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
have a financial crime in particular if

287
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,959
that victim was in another jurisdiction

288
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
and also the location of the criminal if

289
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
you can determine that so

290
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
all three of those positions are in play

291
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
and any of the law enforcement agencies

292
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
in those areas can be called on by you

293
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
to try and support you in investigating

294
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
and possibly prosecuting a crime

295
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
has anybody had an example where law

296
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,640
enforcement has to come into your

297
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,240
organization we have to ask a couple

298
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
questions so we can give out prizes so

299
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,360
raise your hand go ahead sir

300
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,800
what was the you said it was cp oh

301
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
yeah and that's and that actually that's

302
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,839
one of the ways that uh mark and i ran

303
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,519
into each other

304
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
yeah it wasn't

305
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,320
it's okay it's okay mark's out

306
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
he's out now it's enough

307
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
um

308
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
no it was a it was an example of where

309
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
we identified something on his network

310
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,640
and we actually

311
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
had a large network that that

312
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
large corporate network

313
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,959
had a large print

314
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
okay so it's not it's not unusual that

315
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,519
we may come to you

316
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,959
without you coming to us if we see

317
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
something on your network

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,959
through our investigative

319
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,600
access or tools or some other victim

320
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,839
might might identify we may we may come

321
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
to you and say hey we see something and

322
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,040
hopefully you'll work with us to try to

323
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
try to

324
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
determine what that is and that's where

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
the crime scene becomes very important

326
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,399
okay so a couple things you have to

327
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,920
understand all law enforcement agencies

328
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,480
have jurisdictions fbi's jurisdictions

329
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,839
and authorities are national and

330
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
possibly international in their through

331
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,240
their

332
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,600
legal attaches they are not the same

333
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
agencies have different cyber

334
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
capabilities they have different

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,040
abilities to assist you we all watch you

336
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
know the tv and we see you know the

337
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
wonderful you know grab an image of a

338
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,839
drive as they slap something on top of a

339
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
hard drive 10 seconds later they're done

340
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
they've got it they're running out the

341
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
room that's not real

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,279
you have some cyber some agencies that

343
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
cannot really actively support cyber

344
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
some people who are world class so

345
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,399
you're going to see different capable

346
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,040
differing capabilities

347
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
again we talked a little bit about

348
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
federal crimes going those are united

349
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
states code those are the fbi u.s

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
federal court gbi can actually go to

351
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
either state or federal court and then

352
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
of course your local district attorney

353
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
is going to probably charge state crimes

354
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,279
in a state court so there's different if

355
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,639
you're if you're dealing with a federal

356
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,760
crime if you're dealing with a state

357
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
crime there's different agencies that

358
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
can both you know reported and

359
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,720
prosecuted

360
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
they are all fully engaged they're all

361
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
busy they all have limited resources so

362
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
there's gonna come times when you knock

363
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,639
on the door and they might say

364
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,519
yeah

365
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,839
that's a real great problem uh maybe you

366
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,519
should call this guy

367
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,480
so be prepared if that's what happens it

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
not so much in the kind of cases that

369
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
that brian's alluding to where you've

370
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,360
got active ransomware you've got an

371
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
active intrusion active compromise but

372
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,279
if you're dealing with more financial

373
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,320
crime

374
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
uh or if you're dealing with with a a

375
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
more of a financial loss situation

376
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
sometimes it's you have to actually go

377
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,079
to a couple of different uh law

378
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,360
enforcement agencies until you find

379
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
someone who's got the time resources and

380
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,959
ability to prosecute it

381
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
the very first case that was cyber case

382
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,959
was prosecuted in the southern district

383
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,519
of georgia about 10 years ago

384
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,320
it was

385
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
when i first brought it to the u.s

386
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
attorney's office it seemed like a

387
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
pretty low dollar value case and they

388
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
weren't they were interested because it

389
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,279
was new as cyber because the dollar

390
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
value was fairly low they weren't super

391
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
excited about it but when we started to

392
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
dig into what the actual cost of the

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
crime was and it got over several

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
hundred thousand dollars you know then

395
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
you can get so i say that if your

396
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,800
organization is struck by if you're

397
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,440
victimized as part of a criminal act

398
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
don't just look at you know the amount

399
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
of ransomware look at the the what did

400
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
they what did they defeat the amount of

401
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
resources that you utilized what you had

402
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,199
to replace in order to protect yourself

403
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
the the

404
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
the client damage that you might have

405
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
had so there's there's other areas that

406
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
you can look at in this particular case

407
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
it was just a matter of a former

408
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,720
employee had logged in uh

409
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
surreptitiously and and grabbed a bunch

410
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
of uh of proposals and then underbid

411
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,000
them well also lost business was one of

412
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,399
the was one of the victimization so so

413
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,160
think outside the box and those things

414
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
will get your local prosecutors whether

415
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,639
it's state local or federal they'll get

416
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,639
them interested and it all because it

417
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,120
helps the it's not it's not always worth

418
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
it to go through a year of trial for a

419
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
six-month sentence or a probationary

420
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,440
sentence but if you go through a lot of

421
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
work and you can get somebody some true

422
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,120
you know penalties you know that makes

423
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,160
it more

424
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,839
it's a little more it

425
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,959
you get a little more out of it so

426
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,639
that's but think outside the box when it

427
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,399
comes to what the actual victimization

428
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,399
is

429
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,920
so at this point you know what can you

430
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
do today if you know if you haven't had

431
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,519
an engagement with law enforcement what

432
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,800
can you do to make your life a little

433
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
bit simpler well it's hard to call

434
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
somebody you've never talked to you know

435
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
call the front door and say hi fbi i've

436
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
got a problem

437
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,600
what are you going to do it's a lot

438
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,839
easier to call hey brian this is what

439
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,199
just happened

440
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
and you know how do i get support who do

441
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
i talk to how do we move forward and the

442
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
way easiest way to do that from a

443
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,160
corporate perspective is look for

444
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
outreach opportunities infragard is

445
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
fbi's outreach program for critical

446
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
infrastructure there is a chapter in

447
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,800
atlanta there's actually a sub-chapter

448
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,880
in augusta so you join the atlanta

449
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
chapter and you're in this area put on

450
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,320

452
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,519
organization

453
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,720
at which is just standing up right now

454
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
it's great because it gives you an

455
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,240
opportunity to go

456
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
ask questions of the federal government

457
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,959
ask questions of of the fbi get act some

458
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,800
access to what resource they can make

459
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,199
available uh other things they they can

460
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,120
possibly do is maybe deliver a threat

461
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
brief targeted for your area

462
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,079
do you know what the problems are in the

463
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,160
area of your your building in the area

464
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,920
of your data centers and the all of

465
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
those questions that can can be

466
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
addressed by asking the right people and

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
again if time and resource resources are

468
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
available

469
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,920
they can do a threat brief they can talk

470
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
about general threat and this is

471
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
fantastic for you because it allows you

472
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,839
to begin to do some targeting in terms

473
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,880
of threats you want to be able to

474
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,199
mitigate a risk you want to reduce it's

475
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
also wonderful when your auditors come

476
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
around and they say well what have you

477
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,160
done to kind of understand what's going

478
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
on in your area well we talked to the

479
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
fbi and they've delivered this

480
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
particular idea and concept of current

481
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,959
threat and we've addressed that in our

482
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
program and we believe that we you know

483
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
have reduced the risk to our operations

484
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,639
so that's

485
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
some of the benefits some of the ways

486
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
you can do it um i don't know if you you

487
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
know take people knocking on the door or

488
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
calling you just saying hey

489
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
we're very excited about the new regard

490
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
chapters actually only one of two

491
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
satellite chapters in the us and in guam

492
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,280
it's because cyber is so important to

493
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
this area so if you if you're interested

494
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
in that if that's something you want to

495
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
be a part of um if you want to

496
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,760
grab your email we'll make sure you're

497
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,919
on the drug list we had planned on

498
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,000
having a kickoff meeting in the next

499
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,439
really we're talking about september

500
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,760
october but because of the delta variant

501
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,319
some of doj's policy prevented that but

502
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,320
as soon as we're allowed to we're going

503
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,240
to uh have a kickoff meeting at the

504
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
cyber center it'll be an in-person and

505
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,799
virtual and i think that the benefit of

506
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,679
that

507
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
organization here locally because we're

508
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
a smaller community but we're very cyber

509
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
focused will allow you to have some real

510
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
good personal contacts but also access

511
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,240
to the national level threats yes sir

512
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,919
that's a great question you're

513
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,919
absolutely right there's there's so

514
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,160
people are scared to reach out to us for

515
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
a couple reasons one is that disruption

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,280
to the business and the other one is

517
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
what it will look like to the corporate

518
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
brand is it going to negatively impact

519
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
the image of your business and and i can

520
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,559
say we work very hard to minimize both

521
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,600
of those

522
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
i can't always you know i can't

523
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
guarantee

524
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
you know the brain issue i mean if it

525
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,120
comes out if you'll see under everybody

526
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
knows colonial pipeline now and who

527
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
talked about colonial pipeline until

528
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
they got hit with ransomware and shut

529
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,400
down gas or made gas prices go up

530
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,080
probably but so i can't guarantee that

531
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,600
their image because some things are

532
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
outside of our control however the

533
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
disruption we will work everything and

534
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,600
if you have a you know a company that

535
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
you're working with some if not

536
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
everybody has their own

537
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
you know staff in-house so if there's

538
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,039
corporation that you're working with

539
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,600
that does your your protection we'll

540
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,799
work directly with them we'll try to uh

541
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
work off the backups we'll try to work

542
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,720
off just the section that's maybe been

543
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
in that has the the malware or the or

544
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,400
the problem

545
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
whatever we can do to get you back up

546
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
and running as quickly as possible is

547
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,080
what we're going to try to do

548
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,280
todd you want to add anything to them

549
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
you've worked

550
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
i mean we do the best we can i mean it's

551
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,880
not it's not always easy but our goal

552
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
we don't do any it's no value to you if

553
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
we just re-victimize you

554
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
down for for several

555
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
hours or days

556
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
yes sir

557
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
not obligation uh there are now it

558
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
depends on what's taken if there's if

559
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
they've got client victimization where

560
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,600
uh

561
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
people's personal data has been stolen

562
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
there are regulations that control what

563
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,559
they have to notify in terms of their

564
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,400
sub-victims but

565
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
corporates don't have to come they don't

566
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,679
have to come to us they don't they can

567
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,280
you know they can get something and deal

568
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
with themselves and we hope that that

569
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
doesn't happen

570
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,320
because

571
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
we can't prevent it if we don't know

572
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,840
it's happening and and we have the and i

573
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
can speak mostly for the fbi but also in

574
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,799
working with secret service and dhs and

575
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,039
we have great capabilities but we have

576
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
to be able to utilize those i mean if

577
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
the corporations don't come to us and

578
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
tell us or they come to us six months

579
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,799
after the fact once they've realized

580
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,480
that maybe they did have personal

581
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
information get stolen and now they have

582
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
an obligation it's too late for us to

583
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
really do anything about it so the the

584
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,559
idea is to encourage everybody to come

585
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
to us immediately so that we can start

586
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,960
to work proactively maybe even get on

587
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,799
the network and start to track some of

588
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,520
that stuff while it's still being active

589
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,240
it gives us a better chance at success

590
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,760
if you have a cyber event if you think

591
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
about it you know you you've got a last

592
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,960
ip that

593
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
that came at you so if it was a cloud

594
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
service provider or some other formal

595
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,559
hosting provider that really doesn't

596
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,039
tell you much but you can't exactly call

597
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,720
them they can actually serve subpoenas

598
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,880
they can get that start working that hop

599
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
backwards but you can only do that while

600
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,200
the logs are available so time is of the

601
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
essence if you want to start working

602
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,559
that kind of thing backwards and your

603
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,760
question is actually very relevant to

604
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
this email right here so this is kind of

605
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
an example of an email that might have

606
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,919
been received it's kind of a precursor

607
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,919
to a larger attack hey if you just give

608
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
us some bitcoins and pay us now we'll

609
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
prevent but this is an example if a

610
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
corporation gets something like this and

611
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,200
doesn't notify us

612
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
personally i think that's a

613
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
not successful for for me for making the

614
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
outreach but also for the corporation

615
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,159
because at this level if you get

616
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
something like this that says hey we're

617
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,799
gonna we're planning a bigger attack

618
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,200
we're actively on your network right now

619
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
this would give us a great opportunity

620
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,520
to go in and try to identify it and

621
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,360
prevent it now the question has come up

622
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,039
and i've heard this before is are we

623
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,120
gonna make ourselves a bigger target if

624
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,200
we go to law enforcement and

625
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,919
i can't say that you won't but you also

626
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,840
might make yourself not worth the effort

627
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,159
if if they know you're going to go

628
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,000
to the fbi or law enforcement then they

629
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
may go target somebody that's not going

630
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,840
to do that the last victim we had

631
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
locally that got hit with ransomware the

632
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
owner was came right to us told us about

633
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
it and

634
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,039
he made one of the best comments i've

635
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
ever heard he said i'd rather build my

636
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
network back up from zero than pay these

637
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
guys a dollar so that's the kind of

638
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,320
that's the kind of attitude we want to

639
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,400
try to hopefully instill in everybody so

640
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,240
that you'll feel comfortable

641
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,760
coming to us with this um

642
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
30 minutes goes by so quick the other

643
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,039
big

644
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,480
issue that we see a lot is business

645
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,799
email compromise and this is critical if

646
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,720
you get if you're if you get if you're a

647
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
victim of business email compromise and

648
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,600
you notify

649
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,039
ic3.gov which is the internet crime

650
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,600
complaint center you can immediately

651
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
there there's a there's a kill chain

652
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
that works that will immediately try to

653
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,400
set some things in motion to activate

654
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
stopping the transfer of funds if you

655
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
wait 48 hours to do that the chance of

656
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,480
getting those funds recovered becomes

657
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,679
almost

658
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,360
i don't say zero but they become a lot

659
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
less likely but if you can if you

660
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,960
identify

661
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,080
an email compromise where somebody has

662
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,360
reallocated funds to a different account

663
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,760
and you notify them through ic3 there is

664
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
a really good process

665
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,520
amongst the government that will try to

666
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,559
stop the transfer of funds

667
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,440
you know

668
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
it's no guarantee i mean we had one

669
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
recently where they caught it pretty

670
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
quick and they still you know didn't get

671
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
all of their money back but if you get

672
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
if you get half a million dollars stolen

673
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
and you get four hundred thousand

674
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,080
dollars back that's a better than losing

675
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
half a million dollars i would think so

676
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
so yeah and atlanta is number one for

677
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
this risk i don't know why that uh is

678
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
the case uh

679
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
we're trying very hard to get the word

680
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,440
out uh but a lot of times it's just

681
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
education of your staff don't uh making

682
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,960
sure they don't uh fall for

683
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
login

684
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
tricks or

685
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
you know the banks should know not to

686
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,919
transfer money through email

687
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,679
change of accounts but a lot of we we

688
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,120
still see billions and billions of

689
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
dollars being defrauded this way so it's

690
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,559
very low cost it's actually no cost all

691
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,559
they do is they create a forged email

692
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,400
they send it to somebody for example

693
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
your payroll administrator saying hey i

694
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,080
just changed my bank account you need to

695
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
make the update i'll make it effective

696
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,360
immediately please

697
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
um it happened to me it happened to

698
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,799
another gentleman sitting in the room

699
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
and you know we laughed because

700
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,200
it's my job i chased that particular

701
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
kind of fraud for it to happen for them

702
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,279
to pick me was the absolute the most fun

703
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,400
i've had with a fraudster in years

704
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
if your organization is here with a

705
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,279
business email compromise and you've

706
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,159
lost money you should do two things

707
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,799
in two you should go to ic3.gov and you

708
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,559
should call the local fbi though you

709
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,159
should do those two things immediately

710
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,000
that's that is your best chance of any

711
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,919
kind of recovery

712
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,080
yes sir

713
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,679
24 hours

714
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,679
you probably answered that better than i

715
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,200
can

716
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,159
i don't have a cause

717
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,320
so i was trying to speak loud but

718
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
for the regular we don't record direct

719
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,320
regulators at all so when you report it

720
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
to us whether hypothetical we're happy

721
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,159
to have those conversations as well

722
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,799
i have a friend company ryan

723
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,240
we're happy to have those conversations

724
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
there's no magic pause button but we

725
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
don't report to regulators and we can

726
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
certainly work with depending on the

727
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
industry you're in we can work with

728
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,760
those regulators to say hey this and

729
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
company x reported to us we would like

730
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
to work together to make sure we could

731
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,039
do any operational necessary uh

732
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,799
attribution pieces

733
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,080
because there's definitely things we can

734
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,159
do on our end that may if if you

735
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,000
actively being attacked we want to get

736
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
in there while it's happening so so i

737
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,679
think the answer is yes but it's

738
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,120
probably on a case by we don't want to

739
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,960
make a blanket statement and say we hit

740
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,279
the pause button but we can certainly

741
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,240
work with

742
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,880
work with you to to facilitate if if

743
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,640
there's a reason why we want to do that

744
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
it helps the investigation we're bingo

745
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,320
on time so why don't we just open the

746
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
floor for questions and get rid of

747
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
someone else

748
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
we want to get you to chick-fil-a in the

749
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,200
back please celestro

750
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,960
that's a great question so from a

751
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
corporate perspective your contact to

752
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
law enforcement is something that you

753
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
need to organize and you need to have

754
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
everybody engaged you need to have the

755
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,720
team built that includes your corporate

756
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
council you're going to want to know the

757
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,240
executive board is going to want to be

758
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
involved if you have a crisis

759
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
communications team that keeps that

760
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,279
critical portions of your company

761
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,840
informed they're going to all want to

762
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
know what's going on what's the next

763
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
step they're going to want to know what

764
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,200
information they have to release are

765
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
there is there a requirement to notify

766
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
regulators do you know what customer

767
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,760
notifications have to take place if any

768
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
so there's a lot of people that when

769
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,039
this event happens that are going to

770
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,279
want to be engaged from a corporate side

771
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,799
and this is something you can make your

772
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,039
life a lot easier if you tabletop it if

773
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,440
you exercise it so that you understand

774
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,840
how you have to work together

775
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
it's not just all pure play law

776
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,720
enforcement there's a lot of work needs

777
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,399
to be done in corporate side i'll i'll

778
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,320
caveat that with when you have when when

779
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
you reach out to us and get a threat

780
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,480
brief and we're happy to do them um

781
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,279
i would include your your practitioners

782
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,840
but also you know your executive level

783
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,360
and include your attorneys because i

784
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,799
think when they hear and see the bigger

785
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,240
picture they get more involved we do

786
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
we definitely want to get them involved

787
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
early on because

788
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,640
they can they can slow down and and shut

789
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,399
down investigations where they don't

790
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,159
really they're trying to be helpful but

791
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,240
they're they're just causing it to be

792
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,399
delayed and a lot of times if we don't

793
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,760
act fast

794
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
the chances of success become a lot less

795
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,799
likely so i would get them on board very

796
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,000
early

797
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
invite them to the to the meetings with

798
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,840
us prior to and invite him

799
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,919
as soon as you're meeting which might

800
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,159
happen part of the conversation

801
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,320
we have anything left to give away

802
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,080
uh mark had all the giveaways i don't

803
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,000
know we have some more good gifts for

804
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
the people asking questions

805
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,320
i gave them all to one person

806
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,679
yes sir i misunderstood what you said

807
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
um

808
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
i had a slide on that and i deleted it

809
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,840
because i thought we were talking mostly

810
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,279
about the liaison side of things but

811
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
evidence is collected by law enforcement

812
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,480
it's not collected by system

813
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
administrators that being said collect

814
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
according to best practices preserve

815
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,720
logs preserve your regular business

816
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
reporting that's going to be best

817
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
evidence that you can provide to law

818
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
enforcement uh preserve state to the

819
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,159
extent possible if you can get if you

820
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,919
have a compromise machine collect memory

821
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,279
collect you know hard drive all that

822
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,919
stuff all that best practice is critical

823
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,559
um if you can put it in a in an envelope

824
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,799
and and seal it and say this is sealed

825
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,640
up and here's the image that's even

826
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,919
better because now you have a physical

827
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,919
hard drive you can say which matches the

828
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,440
actual image that you're that you're

829
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
actually doing work against or you can

830
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
give copies away if you have to

831
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
so that's best answer i can give you i

832
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
think no i think that's good i mean the

833
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,240
evidence is what it is what you give us

834
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,760
is going to be the evidence we'll come

835
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,000
over we'll sign we'll once you give it

836
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,919
to us we'll we'll establish the chain of

837
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,000
custody for it and then it's you know in

838
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,520
our in our lane and we'll protect it

839
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
as we do any piece of evidence but i

840
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
think i think mike's right i mean you

841
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,080
you do your best practices um anything

842
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,200
you give us

843
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,640
uh is is going to be helpful we're going

844
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
to ask for any logs any data that you

845
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,039
have any screenshots anything that you

846
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,880
might have collected through the process

847
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,320
and then once you give it does then it

848
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,200
becomes evidence yes

849
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,039
um

850
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,399
that that's a great question if you and

851
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,480
we we want any even if even if you're

852
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,200
not you say you catch something before

853
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,279
you become a victim we still might be

854
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,720
interested in that we collect a lot of

855
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,760
intelligence that we can either if it's

856
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
you know maybe it's class nation state

857
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
stuff it might be on the classifier we

858
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,120
might provide that to some of our

859
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
classified partners or if it's something

860
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
that can help everybody in infragard we

861
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
might put it out there so they can see

862
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,799
that vulnerability and and make that

863
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,640
pass so so just like everything else

864
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,240
we've discussed if you see something

865
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,919
like that the best thing to do is reach

866
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,039
out to your local fbi office or whoever

867
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
secret service dhs whoever you're the

868
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,399
most comfortable with but absolutely

869
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,840
we're very interested in that we're in

870
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,600
the way of launching this all right

871
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,440
enjoy your lunch thank you all very much

872
