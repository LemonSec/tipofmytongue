that talked for many many years trying

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,619
to get this this talk

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,140
um ready get it prepped there were four

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,000
other Kerberos talks that weekend I'm

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,820
like please nobody released my technique

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,920
thrilled wake up the next morning look

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,160
at my phone Benjamin delpe in France had

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,320
taken half of my stuff that day with his

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,120
silver ticket attack and I'm like

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
dude you're French you guys don't work

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,020

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
like take the day off man what the hell

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,520
so yeah it's a fun stuff there anyways

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,500
yeah my name is Tim medin uh I am an

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,539
instructor with the Sans Institute I

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,000
teach the uh an author the pen testing

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,379
course

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,600
um I run a cyber security consulting

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
company red Siege

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,600
stop by the table we had shirts maybe we

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,979
have some

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,760
um my guy one of my guys is in Florida

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,100
and uh he's fortunately okay but all of

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,320
our swag is still there so we quickly

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,060
tried to overnight some shirts but they

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,920
might already be gone uh we have

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,619
stickers uh stuff like that too

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,659
um I've been pen testing for uh for a

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,880
long time here

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,259
um it's funny I had to come up with a

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,420
talk title I forgot

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,400
about the talk title like I put together

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,259
a bunch of slides and Mark's like hey

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,780
what's your talk called I'm like

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,340
I don't know

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,200
like did didn't I tell you that already

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,960
he's like no I'm like oh uh so I try to

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,119
come up with something edgy and it kind

43
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,780
of sucks but anyway let's go through so

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,299
I want to sort of these Keynotes are a

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,220
little bit different I like to keep it

46
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,439
somewhat technical I like to keep it

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,560
kind of higher level at the same time

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,159
but in your career I highly encourage

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,580
you be a little bit lazy

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,979
now if there's a parent sitting next to

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,420
the kid I can already see a couple

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,680
elbows like don't listen to this guy

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
he's wrong

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,660
in fact my mom uh Mr Taylor eighth grade

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,879
we were learning basic

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,220
any uh you older folks here know some

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,739
basic yeah I see lots of gray beards and

58
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,180
maybe a little bit of thinning hair yeah

59
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,099
yeah I see you

60
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,660
but on the wall he had this beautiful

61
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,340
side

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,739
the best programmers are the laziest

63
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,819
people

64
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,879
and my mom came in for a a

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,640
parent-teacher conference and she came

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,620
home Furious

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,360
it's like I can't believe that Mr Taylor

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,940
was telling you guys to be lazy

69
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,920
but then he explained why that made

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,019
sense you make the wise decisions when

71
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,180
it comes to programming instead of doing

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,819
the same thing over and over again write

73
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,560
a function to take care of it

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,180
right uh we also see that many times

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,620
the simplest solution is not only the

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,519
answer but oftentimes the best answer

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
how many times out of curiosity have you

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,200
over thought a problem and it ends up

79
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,239
being like the dead freaking simplest

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,680
thing ever

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
yeah I'm surprised I don't see more

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,280
hands okay all right yeah right it

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,940
happens to us all the time relax be lazy

84
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,019
this stupid stuff works

85
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,659
now apt what does APT stand for somebody

86
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,220
help me out I like I like to keep this

87
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,599
interactive by the way if you couldn't

88
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,860
tell

89
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,819
the advanced persistent threat

90
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,400
right every time we hear of a breach

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,799
we're like well an advanced highly

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
sophisticated attacker the advanced

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
persistent threat is what has

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,540
compromised our organization

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,239
and then you read the after action

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,459
reports the compromise you report you're

97
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,720
like

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
really

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,540
were they really that that advanced

100
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,900
were they even persistent

101
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,640
like Threat all right I'll give you that

102
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
part right and there's like there's case

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,978
study here is Equifax

104
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,519
now I'm not trying to pick on Equifax

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,880
this story is universal

106
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,759
it's the same thing we hear at time and

107
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,620
time again

108
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
so let's talk through the timeline here

109
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,080
again with Equifax so here's a situation

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,500
um March 2017 the cve is announced so

111
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,840
now the world knows

112
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,979
this flaw exists

113
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,660
the breach occurs two months later

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,580
now at this point

115
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,479
there is public exploit code

116
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,859
what does the p stand for again

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
versus this one sorry yeah tell me any

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
word that starts with p

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
it's like Cookie Monster here right

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,720
yeah the P here stands for persistence

121
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,560
well this was off the shelf code and it

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,520
took them two months persistent

123
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,380
right like mom tells you clean your room

124
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,360
I'm persistent mom I gotcha in December

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,060
right two months also

126
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,699
it's off the shelf code

127
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,639
the A and APC stands for what

128
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,199
advanced

129
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,259
I mean the dudes downloaded it and just

130
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,820
used it

131
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,440
two months later

132
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,620
right so we hear about this advanced

133
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,620
persistent Threat all the time but so

134
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,000
many times

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,860
it's not

136
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,840
I think curiosity do we have some folks

137
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,360
who work in IR here

138
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,180
the IRS I'm sure so many of the stories

139
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,860
you would hear in IR at least the folks

140
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,020
that I've dealt with like how are the

141
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,460
bad guys getting in well it's like

142
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,300
fishing and bad credentials it's not the

143
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,919
high sexy thing it's not like

144
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,979
necessarily like the brand new thing

145
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,139
um the bad guys that we're in for months

146
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,120
finally detected them kicked him uh

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,740
kicked him out right

148
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,479
here's another article I've tried to

149
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,820
find a more recent article but I haven't

150
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,400
found one uh this is so this is a little

151
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,139
bit dated

152
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,419
but it's important to look at the timing

153
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,380
here

154
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,419
so we've got the date of this article

155
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,380
May 30 2020 uh this is an advisory here

156
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,840
from the NSA very near and dear I'm sure

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,180
to many of your hearts

158
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,220
they've been exploiting vulnerability

159
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,919
and extra mail transfer since August

160
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,740
2019.

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,500
August to May is what like nine months

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,300
we can make a child in that amount of

163
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,280
time

164
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,059
like we can create

165
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,520
like we could actually breed new people

166
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
to patch for us in that amount of time

167
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,539
right it is not much uh number one here

168
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,840
from October 2020.

169
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,800
in a cve the second set of numbers is

170
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,360
the year

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,539
2019 2019 2019 2019 2018 2015.

172
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,419
this child we have bred to give us to

173
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,360
install patches is now in kindergarten

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,880
and can read

175
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,060
right this this this this patching class

176
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,639
of humans now can actually install the

177
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,080
patches themselves

178
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
2015.

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,599
the flaws here that were being exploited

180
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,199
were all multiple years old

181
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,060
right we're looking at the end of the

182
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,880
year here there's lots of 2020s sorry

183
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,599
2019s and even older

184
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,639
so when it comes to that advanced

185
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,400
persistent threat

186
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,199
they weren't even persistent enough

187
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,660
necessarily to exploit it in the last

188
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,880
six years

189
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,979
right really really long time let me

190
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,360
tell you a couple other situations that

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,099
I encountered in my career sort of

192
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,220
related to this the dead simple stuff

193
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,639
so how many offensive people let's say

194
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,240
not not just offensive but like security

195
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,520
offensive

196
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
a few of you that's it all right just on

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,940
this side nobody over here all right

198
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,700
we'll talk to you folks here how much

199
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,559
time do you end up spending on a test

200
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,059
and I don't know how I'm gonna have you

201
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,860
answer this but let me

202
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,899
um when you're doing your test do you

203
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,520
spend a bunch of time doing some AV

204
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,500
evasion type stuff

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
my pen testers I got one yes

206
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,180
he speaks for everybody okay

207
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,580
it's oftentimes it does take a lot of

208
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,480
time

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,880
but just like we saw with some of the

210
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,040
other stuff sometimes the dead simple

211
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,779
crap works

212
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,940
so I was working with a Friend of Mine

213
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,800
Derek Banks we were working on a pen

214
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,940
test

215
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,880
and I really needed netcat up on a

216
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,500
Windows host

217
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,260
but if I just copied netcat up to that

218
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,279
host

219
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,839
it's getting busted

220
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,420
I was getting burned

221
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,180
so Derek being smarter than I am is like

222
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,820
hey wait a second

223
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,580
there's a tool called nmap

224
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,940
and in nmap there is another executable

225
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,880
called n Cat

226
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,620
and Cat does the same thing as netcat

227
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,800
this time though this is a n map

228
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
approved script we all use nmap right to

229
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,660
even see security teams systems

230
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,420
administrators a lot of people use nmap

231
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,640
people Trust

232
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,760
they also trusted MCAT

233
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,279
upload it and it just worked flawlessly

234
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,140
and what's even better

235
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,180
it has more features than netcat so it

236
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,339
supports encryption and all that jazz

237
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,140
meanwhile I'm like trying to like

238
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,240
reverse engineer This and like change

239
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,800
strings and he's like bro I got it

240
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,399
working I was like oh what'd you do uh

241
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
I just download it and ran it

242
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,620
it's like damn it dang it absolutely

243
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,540
worked another a great one uh Jeff

244
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,399
mcjunkin good friend of mine fantastic

245
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,959
gentleman

246
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,720
he was uh doing some AV Invasion can't

247
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,000
share the the real sample but was

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,720
looking at a um an executable called CTF

249
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
tool

250
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,160
try to run that sucker on Windows

251
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,040
got busted so he's like all right

252
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,080
let me take a little bit of time looking

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
at a tool called Defender check to

254
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,180
figure out the offset where is my

255
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,640
executable getting busted

256
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,820
and it showed up with the name Tavis

257
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
ormandy

258
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,860
so the the name the name of the author

259
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,640
was the trigger to mark this thing as

260
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,140
bad

261
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,720
so what's the simple answer

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,920
change his name yet Tavis ormandy is bad

263
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,140
now he puts on a mustache and those

264
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,940
little crappy glasses

265
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,940
his brother to have his zorbandy totally

266
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,620
cool

267
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,920
right and of course worked just fine

268
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,479
one of my favorite things

269
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,620
and by the way when I say favorite

270
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
things I'm an offensive person so it's

271
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,399
probably not good for everybody else

272
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,760
but the gift that keeps on giving

273
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
bad passwords

274
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
right like I kind of feel bad as a pen

275
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,940
tester

276
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,820
that most of the times I'm getting in or

277
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,640
doing lateral movement doing most of my

278
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,959
stuff

279
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,640
it's this

280
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,940
it's the bad passwords

281
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,220
right it just works

282
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,200
and I hear people well don't you use

283
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,360
exploits I didn't know

284
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,720
I don't have to I can just log in

285
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,000
I was like why like the exploits are

286
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,480
hard this I just log in like you do

287
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,880
and people pick these exceptionally uh

288
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,560
bad passwords

289
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,019
one of my favorites and by the way this

290
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,200
is not a suggestion don't do this

291
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,860
uh any Auditors in the room

292
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,360
you guys don't allow Auditors here right

293
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,220
no Auditors allowed very cool press

294
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,120
conference okay cool

295
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,420
according to the Auditors how often are

296
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,600
we supposed to change our passwords

297
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,060
90 days you know why

298
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,040
when Moses came down from the mountain

299
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,440
so thirds have

300
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,680
no sorry when Einstein derived E equals

301
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,620
m c squared he then

302
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,000
no

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,880
my money it was two dudes working

304
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,360
together like hey Carl

305
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,220
how long do you think passwords are

306
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,720
should be good for it's like well I

307
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,279
don't know Steve what do you think about

308
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,660
90 days

309
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,720
great Carl stamp it

310
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,120
and now we have this if you ask anybody

311
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,220
why 90 days there is no answer

312
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,260
it's like well it's kind of like

313
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,100
dividing 365 by four if you're kind of

314
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,779
bad at math and just like to round

315
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,000
things

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,100
so we end up with this this 90 days

317
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,300
right

318
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,860
how many of you have worked the help

319
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,100
desk on January 2nd

320
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,860
what's the call that you get non-stop

321
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,399
that day

322
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,120
well no no there's one call January 2nd

323
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,160
what are you getting all day long

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,040
what's my password right how many of you

325
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,620
have called on January 2nd

326
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,660
and sucked somebody else's will to live

327
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,300
no nobody okay

328
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,000
so

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,220
people get tired of calling I.T they're

330
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,600
like man

331
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,399
looking out their window right like it

332
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,100
might be kind of cold here maybe an

333
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,880
occasional snow January 2nd like man if

334
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,440
I could just look out my window and know

335
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,940
my password

336
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,940
you're like huh

337
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,500
it's winter

338
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,639
what if I use capital W

339
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,260
lowercase enter

340
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,660
as my password it's like oh wait I need

341
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,579
a number

342
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,740
and there's a winter this year

343
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,360
and there's probably going to be a

344
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,980
winter next year

345
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,560
so I can't reuse my password so like man

346
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,779
if only there was a number that would

347
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,459
differentiate this winter from next

348
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,839
winter

349
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,880
and they sit there for probably 45

350
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,860
minutes to an hour to come up with that

351
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,240
solution

352
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
which is what

353
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,519
the year

354
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,320
right and then 90 days later they

355
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,019
changed their password to what

356
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,060
spring you guys are way smarter I was in

357
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,279
a room like this what's after winter and

358
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,579
they're like

359
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,620
nothing I'm like all right cool at least

360
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,820
I know you're not using that password

361
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,139
scheme because you're not smart enough

362
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,880
to but whatever

363
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,800
nine days later after that right it's

364
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,100
super hot here in Augusta we have

365
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,199
summer very good no one screwed up the

366
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,300
months yet very good

367
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,480
right so we see this type of scheme and

368
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
again as the attacker

369
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,399
I don't need all the passwords

370
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,079
I need one

371
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,480
right I need one way and I was at

372
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,100
another organization

373
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,720
they said Tim that's not going to work

374
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,800
here

375
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,540
I was excited

376
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,279
I was like good good for you what are

377
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,139
you guys doing to prevent us are you are

378
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,720
you Banning bad passwords are you

379
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,120
preventing passwords with the season or

380
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,699
the year he's like no

381
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,220
we fixed it because we changed passwords

382
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,420
every month

383
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,420
foreign

384
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,899
and waited

385
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,839
and in my mind like there are so many

386
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,459
sarcastic answers that are like just

387
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,839
filtering by like oh this is a good one

388
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,160
this is a better thing to say I'm like

389
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,339
don't say it don't say it don't say it

390
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,560
and I'm like I'm just gonna try the

391
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,839
month in the year you see him go

392
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,160
oh

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
they hadn't occurred to him uh first

394
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,480
when we first account we had we got was

395
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,100
the uh the director of HR

396
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,980
there are two groups of people that most

397
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,320
most people in a business are scared of

398
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,600
one of them is I.T

399
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,120
we're not scared of I.T in fact we crush

400
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,920
them for fun when we're offensive people

401
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,000
right

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
I mean we help them that sounds rude

403
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,820
Human Resources still terrified

404
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,800
right because they can fire me they

405
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,959
control my benefits they help me

406
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,420
understand whatever the complication is

407
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,720
with my my deductible and reaching my

408
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,880
limits and my children and what whatever

409
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,440
Magic

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,480
and you get attachments for days from HR

411
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,339
so just send a couple of emails people

412
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,439
are clicking on stuff like like Absolute

413
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,919
Math so we're seeing this is a dead

414
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,720
simplest way in that we're seeing

415
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,380
both from externally uh internally I

416
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,939
actually tweeted about this and said hey

417
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,559
give me your interesting password

418
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,599
stories

419
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,119
um winter 2019 here was one of them

420
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,059
guess the con the password just from a

421
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,000
conversation

422
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,799
I'm so interested to know how that

423
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,600
conversation went

424
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,380
right uh uh the domain admin was this

425
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,980
password was the same as the username

426
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,020
that's some advanced stuff right there

427
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,900
right uh password spray this is where

428
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,280
you're trying

429
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,620
just a few passwords for all of the

430
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,059
users

431
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,179
30 of the company

432
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,940
30 percent right

433
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,580
um breached passwords right they use

434
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,500
their password at some other site that

435
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,260
password is compromised and reuse it

436
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,720
these are the ways these are the good

437
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,460
guys

438
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,960
right these are the ways that I'm

439
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
getting in guess how the bad guys are

440
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,900
getting it

441
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,000
the same way

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,220
they're just not telling you

443
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,740
you're getting a free pen test it's more

444
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,419
expensive and you don't get a cool

445
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,320
report at the end

446
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,980
right like they're doing they're running

447
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,020
ransomware like you're still paying you

448
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,640
don't get the cool report not telling

449
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
you how they got in

450
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,299
but this is the exact same thing that

451
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:37,799
we're seeing here

452
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,539
right I've seen other things like in

453
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,980
help pages

454
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,080
we're literally like the help page says

455
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,799
hey

456
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,940
use this password to uh to log in here

457
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,220
um there was I've seen documentation

458
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,440
publicly available

459
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,980
again just simply to to log in once

460
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,039
again those lovely lovely uh passwords

461
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,340
now the purpose of my talk here is to

462
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,480
show you

463
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,960
much of this stuff is dead simple

464
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,740
I would suspect many of you are here you

465
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,720
know to learn to make yourself better

466
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,260
maybe make a job or a career change set

467
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,660
yourself up for the future

468
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,059
this is a scenario this was a number of

469
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,740
years ago

470
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,799
I had never attacked any iot devices

471
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,480
before I'd never done it

472
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,340
I wanted to

473
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,980
so I saw this blog post from a friend of

474
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,000
mine and he in his blog post showed how

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
he reverse engineered this firmware

476
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,820
so let me show you the the the the the

477
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,400
screenshots from here so this was a

478
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,100
trend net camera here

479
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,440
and what he did is downloaded the

480
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,280
firmware and used a tool called bin walk

481
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,419
what Ben walk does is it looks in that

482
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,520
file for other

483
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,620
pieces of files

484
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,720
other headers

485
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,179
now the modern versions of Ben Walker

486
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,340
will actually extract it for you in the

487
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,440
olden days you had to do it manually so

488
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,720
he was using the DD command here to

489
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,760
split it apart I don't expect to be able

490
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,400
to read all of this text here but what

491
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,740
he's done here is we see at the top is

492
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,919
there's three chunks there's offset zero

493
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,220
to that what three two three two zero

494
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,080
there's another chunk in the middle and

495
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,700
then one at the end

496
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,160
so he splits it up into a three pieces

497
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,559
and then looks at the third one the

498
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,520
third one says it is a Linux file system

499
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,580
gzip compressed data was root f s from

500
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,500
Unix

501
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,020
extracts that

502
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,380
looks inside that and sees a directory

503
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,140
called uh server

504
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,820
inside there CGI bin

505
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,220
there's another directory

506
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,320
hey Nani

507
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,660
if you had to guess

508
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,980
what does a Nani stand for

509
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,179
Anonymous yeah these questions aren't

510
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,039
hard

511
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,740
anonymous

512
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,799
so literally taking the camera going to

513
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,620
the anani directory CGI or mjpg.cgi

514
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,000
and you had remote access to the camera

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,500
dead simple

516
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,380
right now this was his version

517
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,500
this is was what he did I'm like cool so

518
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,980
I went to Amazon I spent

519
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,820
42.31 after tax to buy my own camera

520
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,400
different brand and literally walked

521
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,700
through the exact same steps here

522
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,320
ran bin walk

523
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,659
extracted the firmware

524
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,539
found the file system I didn't find

525
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,840
anything called a Nani

526
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,440
now where is one of the first places if

527
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,900
you compromise a Linux system

528
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,559
or if somebody compromises where is the

529
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,740
one of the first places you look when

530
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,100
you're trying to learn about that system

531
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
somebody says in the back there louder

532
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,260
Etsy password good call

533
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,440
now in Etsy password is account

534
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,820
information

535
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
in newer Linux systems

536
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,280
you have passwords in another file

537
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,799
typically Etsy shadow

538
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,980
but in Old Linux systems

539
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,260
and brand new iot devices

540
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,500
they put

541
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
there was an oh no in the back you see

542
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,700
you know it's coming don't you

543
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,980
the passwords were in

544
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,659
Etsy password

545
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,640
that's okay

546
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,580
usually the passwords are hashed

547
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,640
this case they use a very special

548
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,440
hashing algorithm

549
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,440
base64s

550
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,120
now base 64 is kind of like the crappy

551
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,580
code you come up with your friends

552
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,700
okay it is not encryption it's encoding

553
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,400
you can literally grab a pen and paper

554
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,919
and decode this right be sure to drink

555
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,700
your oval tape

556
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,020
now this password I'm looking through

557
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,580
the use

558
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,159
through the the file here so I'm looking

559
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,260
through the file I see root web

560
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,659
interface there's a user root

561
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,600
in the file there's a user viewer in the

562
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,539
web interface there's a user viewer

563
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,940
in my file it's a password there's a

564
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,080
user Factory test

565
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:53,039
thank you for the extremely deep side

566
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,780
like it's fantastic anything like a

567
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,220
special effects sound effects button

568
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,840
it's great

569
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,640
that user account was not in the web

570
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,500
interface

571
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,380
so I could log in as this Factory a test

572
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,419
count on every single one of these

573
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,460
devices throughout the world

574
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,559
okay now

575
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,679
I literally followed this hack by number

576
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,919
and looked in the first file that we

577
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:17,880
look at

578
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,919
and found this thing

579
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,620
literally it was like two to three

580
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,240
minutes

581
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,179
and I was like I mean it felt good but

582
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,919
at the same time I was like

583
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,260
that's it

584
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,539
I ended up selling that to the company a

585
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,440
bug Bounty uh for four thousand bucks

586
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
I've never made that much money that

587
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,159
quickly in my entire life

588
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,039
and that probably never will again

589
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,559
right four thousand bucks it was funny

590
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
because it was before the company had a

591
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,340
bug Bounty program so you had to be a

592
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,900
little bit careful

593
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,080
if you if you contact them and say hey

594
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,000
bros pay me or else I release this

595
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
there's a very special legal term for

596
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,580
that

597
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,520
it's called extortion

598
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,679
so you had to like be a little bit cagey

599
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,299
if you're like well do you compensate

600
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,919
for exclusive disclosure of

601
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,600
vulnerabilities that could negatively

602
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
impact your brand and stock price

603
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,700
right this is not a contractual

604
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,500
agreement that I could blah blah blah

605
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,820
anyway

606
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,159
um but just literally followed somebody

607
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,159
else's work here

608
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,159
I'm not saying don't try to be original

609
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,679
but there are so many people's shoulders

610
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,740
to stand on and there's so much out

611
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,840
there try what other peoples have done

612
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,700
so that you can understand that we'll

613
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,080
come back to some of that a little bit

614
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,580
later here too

615
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,620
another situation

616
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,799
anybody a giant football fan

617
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,460
I am a huge football fan like I wish I'm

618
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,900
trying to see if I can get a table at my

619
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,760
booth to have college football behind me

620
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,919
I think it'd be fantastic

621
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,380
um anyways I'm a giant I'm a big Green

622
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,059
Bay Packers Fan I grew up in Central

623
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,159
Wisconsin

624
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,700
um and I was trying to stream the

625
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,159
Packers game I live in Texas I was

626
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,380
trying to stream the Packers game down

627
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,000
in Texas because it's not on the local

628
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
the local station so I bought I forget

629
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,039
it was like NFL rewind allows you to

630
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,000
watch every single game

631
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,400
um and I'm watching it on my uh my my

632
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,460
tablet it was an Android tablet using

633
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,760
Amazon app but I have an Apple TV so I

634
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
wanted to like stream it to my Apple TV

635
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,179
and I tried it says sorry AirPlay is not

636
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,580
supported for this device

637
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,799
and I was like well that stinks or no

638
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,320
sorry AirPlay is not enabled for this

639
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,000
device I was like well that's a weird

640
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,919
wording

641
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,260
so what I did is I downloaded it so I

642
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,740
looked at I I I fired up a sniffer and I

643
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,679
looked at what was being sent to and

644
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,240
from this app

645
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,400
inside the app there was this

646
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,000
configuration file and it said AirPlay

647
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,799
enabled

648
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,380
false

649
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,440
and I was like you jerks

650
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,500
it's there you're just like we hate

651
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,140
Apple screw you

652
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,440
so what's the obvious fix here

653
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,580
true

654
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,120
right AirPlay enabled true

655
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,760
now in my app I get an error message

656
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,179
that says invalid signature

657
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,520
so I scroll down in the configuration

658
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,380
and there's this signature thing at the

659
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,080
end I'm like dang it

660
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,020
what's the fix now

661
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,440
recite it that's hard

662
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,299
give me easy

663
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,880
nuke it

664
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,140
downloads the sign downloads the

665
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,720
configuration file checks the signature

666
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,580
oh there isn't one

667
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,059
fair enough

668
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,600
like you don't have to be super fancy

669
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
try the dead simple thing first to be

670
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,279
fair I was like trying to get the

671
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,320
certificate I was trying to factor the

672
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,900
key I spent hours on it where and then

673
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,900
almost literally by accident my search

674
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,360
and replace didn't work and it just

675
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,679
deleted it I'm like why is it working

676
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,940
I'm like

677
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,980
well that's amazing

678
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,720
I wish I would have thought of that

679
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,880
sooner right try the dead simple thing

680
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,120
first be lazy

681
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,039
I got one of the guys on my team Mike

682
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,419
who is the destroyer of MFA

683
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,659
and he tries really complex things like

684
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,120
normally you put the username

685
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,000
the password the MFA token and access

686
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,279
the page right

687
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,179
username password MFA nah just skip that

688
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,620
and go right to the page the page to get

689
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,940
fair enough close enough

690
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,380
you tried

691
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,480
we asked you for the MFA but you didn't

692
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,700
have it but here you go

693
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,340
right the dead simple thing here

694
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,100
we had the Mac OS flaw a few years ago

695
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,380
anybody remember this lovely thing

696
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,080
enter enter enter enter enter and you

697
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,600
get a root prompt

698
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,880
right dead simple stuff literally

699
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,440
somebody hammering a keyboard there's

700
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,779
probably somebody holding a toddler in

701
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,179
their lap it's like

702
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,740
how did I get Roots all of a sudden

703
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,059
right

704
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,360
or my favorite flaw of all time

705
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,299
I call this these the kids soccer trophy

706
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,500
flop

707
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,720
so with this flaw

708
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,240
one in 256 times authentication says

709
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,659
congratulations you're in

710
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,120
now I'm trying to imagine the person

711
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,559
that found this

712
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,380
because like nessus probably reported

713
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,360
like you have a bad password on this

714
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,779
MySQL server so the person tries to log

715
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,000
in with this bad password right it

716
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,980
doesn't work

717
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,260
and they're like well Nessa said it

718
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,260
worked so they tried again

719
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,299
and then they probably rage and they're

720
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,760
like four one to Infinity log in go

721
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,220
five seconds later it works

722
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,380
right is the parts but participation

723
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,899
trophy hey you tried to authenticate

724
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:20,059
good job Tommy come on in

725
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,200
right dead simple flaws like this now

726
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
I want to let you know like there's so

727
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,700
many times in my career that I've tried

728
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,760
to solve the problem up here when the

729
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,559
solution is down here and this isn't

730
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,899
even just the technical stuff

731
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,179
right we mentioned this a little bit

732
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,940
earlier how many times have you tried an

733
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,799
exceptionally hard thing stepped away

734
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,539
for a second you're like oh my God it's

735
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,919
the simple answer

736
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,320
that absolutely worked

737
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,380
related to this

738
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,779
oops wrong one sorry

739
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,880
you can you can always you can always

740
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,980
learn more

741
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,200
the most dangerous people in any

742
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,059
organization in my mind are the people

743
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,980
who know everything

744
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,539
and they don't want to listen to other

745
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,559
people

746
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,960
and even worse than that

747
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,480
they squashed the new people

748
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,179
the new people have some new idea some

749
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,100
new experience you probably have done

750
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,340
maybe 10 maybe even 20 years ago let him

751
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,419
enjoy it

752
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,000
like hey cool good job for you and then

753
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,679
shut the hell up

754
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,700
you don't have to tell them I was like

755
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,580
well when I did that who cares

756
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,860
right let them enjoy that you never know

757
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,860
too much the the most

758
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,520
confident I was I ever was in my entire

759
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,000
career was when I was brand new

760
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,159
I remember walking into a company doing

761
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,740
a pen test I have never been more

762
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,419
confident in a pen test in my entire

763
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,980
life

764
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,200
the most confident people I know these

765
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,260
days are super happy to say I don't know

766
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,020
and be okay with it and in fact you

767
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,220
probably work with some of those people

768
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,899
and they're the most trustworthy people

769
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,039
you know

770
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
because you know

771
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,820
they're not going to BSU

772
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,460
they're not going to lie to you right

773
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,760
but it's it's hard sometimes to say I

774
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,679
don't know and be okay with that

775
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,779
especially when you're more Junior when

776
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,700
you actually are learning but I

777
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,580
encourage you Embrace that

778
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,440
like get quickly like I don't know but

779
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
here's how I'm going to try to figure

780
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,620
out the the answer to this

781
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,820
all right we're going to come back to

782
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,140
that a little bit more here's another

783
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,419
sort of situation here

784
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,340
a number of years ago there was a

785
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,860
competition to go to Las Vegas

786
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,820
go to black hat

787
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,840
okay

788
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,000
whoever won this would get a black card

789
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
free entrance to what to Black Cat I had

790
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,460
never been to black hat so I'm like cool

791
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,760
I want to go how to be a ninja in three

792
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
steps

793
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
like all right cool let's be a ninja

794
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,539
here

795
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,600
okay so how to be a ninja step one so

796
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,980
there was this app

797
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,260
that if you downloaded it and installed

798
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,419
it on your phone you would get like 10

799
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,539
points just installing the app gives you

800
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,539
10 points and there were other ways to

801
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,600
get extra points you could crack

802
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,880
passwords you can map the network you

803
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,460
could sniff a URL some other stuff but

804
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,419
just installing the app 10 points

805
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,580
cool right

806
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,860
so I want to get more than I need to get

807
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,840
a lot of points because I want this free

808
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,860
ticket

809
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,460
right I install the app on my phone Next

810
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Step what's the next step here and again

811
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,480
simple think dumb

812
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,539
uninstalled install it again cool

813
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,960
what else that takes a while right

814
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,700
related to that you're on the correct

815
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,679
path here

816
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,140
installed on 1000 devices sir I don't

817
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,460
have that many friends

818
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,580
yeah

819
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,460
there we go so when I install this thing

820
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,679
it needs to communicate back to the

821
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,719
server to say yes this was installed on

822
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,040
a device

823
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,099
so the actual install uninstall

824
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,940
reinstall process is essentially a

825
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,800
replay attack

826
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,339
snip the traffic replay this over and

827
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,800
over and over and over again

828
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,179
and it worked

829
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,540
right scoring a a ton of points here and

830
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,460
if we looked at the payload we saw some

831
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,639
sort of payload that looked like this

832
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,080
right

833
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,359
okay cool

834
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,540
now the problem was now Tim tomes he

835
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,460
might be here a little bit later uh Tim

836
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,560
tomes uh former good friend of mine

837
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,399
um he and I were working on this

838
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,300
together

839
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,000
so we installed this app

840
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,599
um after a while it was it was actually

841
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,400
Mother's Day weekend

842
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,160
now I'm we're at lunch for my

843
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,920
mother-in-law and Tim and I were going

844
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,540
back and forth like we're trying to

845
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,220
figure out how to make it faster and

846
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,619
stuff like his internet's faster than

847
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,560
mine so hypothetically I may have used

848
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,420
some work servers to send more traffic

849
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,760
to play it faster

850
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,680
um so we're going back and forth I

851
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,480
figured out a trick to make it go faster

852
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,880
and I'm looking at my phone at Mother's

853
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,760
Day lunch don't do this

854
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,040
and according to my math I'm going to

855
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,000
pass Kim in about 10 minutes so I'm like

856
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,640
yeah happy Mother's Day refresh refresh

857
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,940
refresh refresh right just keep looking

858
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,339
the site goes offline

859
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,380
so now I'm like panicking I'm like great

860
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,700
like I said there's whole lunch now and

861
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,560
I gotta figure out what's going on

862
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,020
um come to find out

863
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,940
they're like we were crashing their

864
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,320
servers because we were just hammering

865
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,640
them

866
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,619
um but they said hey no more replay

867
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,540
attacks

868
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,040
so we see

869
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,680
this I'm like oh crap

870
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,060
right

871
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,980
so I would send we would try to register

872
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,540
it would say hey

873
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,560
um

874
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,440
duplicate device ID what's the next step

875
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,060
then

876
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,700
what's that

877
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,440
throw random data in there I like your

878
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,079
thinking didn't work

879
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,300
what does this look like

880
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,180
base64 right let's decode this thing

881
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,078
looks like this

882
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,460
what do we change then

883
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,119
the Android ID right change the the

884
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,599
um the Android ID

885
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,160
base64 encoded send it back to the

886
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,760
server now it says invalid Magic

887
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,400
so here is the payload so the data is

888
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,339
what I showed you right here

889
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,820
right now we've got this magic what's

890
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,180
the first option with the magic

891
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,339
nuke it right

892
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,320
good good call

893
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,060
didn't work

894
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,579
The Next Step here then

895
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,619
well the answer is a little bit of

896
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,599
reverse engineering so literally open up

897
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,720
the thing in a Jad X and do a search for

898
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,040
Magic

899
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,280
like where's Magic okay cool found magic

900
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,780
here

901
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,700
all right look at the code so there's

902
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,200
magic next to it a variable called stir

903
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,260
stir is used up here with A2 we will

904
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,599
worry about what A2 does later but I see

905
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,700
A2 like a couple of times A2 is up here

906
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,320
um A2 comes from B which is my data

907
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,320
right so the question is what does this

908
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,760
function do at the top

909
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,320
so what's that

910
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,820
did you you figured this out already

911
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,060
holy awesome okay cool yeah what I was

912
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,880
going to ask is what does this do I did

913
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,000
zero reverse engineering on this

914
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,220
but just looked at it what was the key

915
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,480
for you that was base64

916
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,079
so you saw that so you saw the pattern

917
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,960
in the uh the magic back here okay very

918
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,200
good

919
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,260
just reading the code what were the two

920
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,579
pieces that stood out to you one or two

921
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,260
where they're starting an array the two

922
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,400
pieces that stood up for me literally

923
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,359
says bad base64 but the the the three

924
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,640
slash four because base64 takes three

925
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,619
characters converted to four literally I

926
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:38,940
didn't reverse engineer this at all I'm

927
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,160
like what happens if their magic

928
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,400
encoding is just more base64.

929
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,640
and then take the second character and

930
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,500
the last nine and duct tape them

931
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,240
together and now we can create our own

932
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,740
Magic

933
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,619
right now I'm a sorcerer I don't need

934
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,079
your magic I have my own

935
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,880
right we are going to Harry Potter the

936
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,400
crap out of this thing

937
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,660
so

938
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,300
talking to Tim he figures out like hey

939
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,560
you know what

940
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,140
here's the the code here I've got a um

941
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,020
this the inside is the plan the plan

942
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,800
here by default is basic well if you

943
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,200
tell it you are on the Platinum plan you

944
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,079
have a multiplier now very bottom of 2.5

945
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,320
times for each request

946
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,520
so instead of 10 points you now get 25.

947
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,220
also if you submit a payload with every

948
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,380
single one of these things you get all

949
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,359
of those points in fact

950
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,079
the um cracking a password didn't work

951
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,640
in the app

952
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,800
but I was scoring points we were scoring

953
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,720
points for this because we just put the

954
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,119
XML in there that said password cracked

955
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,480
true

956
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,160
and multiply that right so that one was

957
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,740
broken so we take 10 plus 5 plus

958
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,720
whatever

959
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,960
142 multiply it by two and a half so 355

960
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,599
points per request now

961
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,260
right so I'm sitting at my house I get a

962
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,800
call Sunday at my desk

963
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,320
from the guy who runs this thing he

964
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,300
basically says hey this is this is so

965
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,560
and so can you stop

966
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,260
because we had crashed their servers

967
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,680
like multiple times so like I I'm

968
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,260
talking to Tim tomes I actually I had I

969
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,760
had passed him at this point I'm like

970
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,500
Tim man I like I know you're going to

971
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,900
try to get ahead of me he's like oh

972
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,820
I'm already going to black hat do you

973
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,440
want the ticket

974
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,140
yeah

975
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,040
I do Tim

976
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,900
this is why I no longer talk to no just

977
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,119
kidding um so we ripped through this

978
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,079
thing

979
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,880
we can see like Christy Pryor here

980
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,099
probably had some of those

981
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,720
um we were on I was on track to get like

982
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,820
a billion points but then there and

983
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,160
don't crash our servers whatever

984
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,420
um you know got they got the trip but

985
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,480
again the answer here was simple

986
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,820
right the simple replay attack is what

987
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,839
did it

988
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,079
not even reverse engineering the code

989
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,060
while Mass guessing like maybe it's

990
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,300
base64 right just try the simple stuff

991
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,000
don't you don't have to get super super

992
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,339
complicated

993
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,040
learn from new people

994
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,980
I can't tell you how many times I have

995
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,200
been trapped in trying to solve a

996
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,180
problem up here

997
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,300
and instead should have just tried this

998
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,520
simple answer or ask somebody who's

999
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
never experienced that problem in their

1000
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,579
life

1001
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,920
there's two real world scenarios where

1002
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,920
this has worked phenomenally well RSA

1003
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,099
encryption existed because there was a

1004
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,400
new guy to uh to the company and the

1005
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,380
boss man said hey can you figure out how

1006
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,440
to do asymmetric encryption

1007
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,260
and so over lunch he figured it out

1008
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,460
basically

1009
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,020
he's like oh my God we've been working

1010
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,460
on this for years

1011
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,220
but nobody told him that it was supposed

1012
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,960
to be a hard problem

1013
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,820
and literally saw that it was another

1014
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,200
case

1015
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,900
college professor had two math problems

1016
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,160
on the board

1017
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,220
two math problems on the board

1018
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,040
and a student came in late saw that went

1019
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,780
home came back he's like I think I got

1020
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,640
the answers it was really hard

1021
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,619
and the professor said

1022
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,960
we didn't have homework he's like well

1023
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,220
you had two problems on the board

1024
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,960
yesterday so I spent a few hours last

1025
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,700
night and I solved it

1026
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,000
there were two formulas or um algorithms

1027
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,040
whatever that had never been solved in

1028
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
mathematics before and he just did it

1029
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,820
that night because he thought he was

1030
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,619
supposed to be solvable homework and no

1031
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,000
one told him it was supposed to be hard

1032
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,680
so you know talk to me get get that

1033
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,740
perspective don't think oh you're new I

1034
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,839
can't learn anything from you

1035
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,000
related to that

1036
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,760
you're gonna go do some talks here today

1037
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,140
you're going to see a lot of people

1038
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,359
getting up in front of you

1039
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,920
we've all did our first presentation

1040
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,780
my first presentation sucked so bad

1041
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,540
he says yes he was we

1042
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,920
were you there

1043
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,680
you might he actually might have been

1044
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,440
it was a 60-minute presentation on

1045
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,760
Powershell

1046
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,160
I finished it in 16 and a half minutes

1047
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,060
I got up front incredibly excited super

1048
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,200
nervous

1049
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
I just went

1050
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,819
just as fast as I could

1051
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:39,240
and in my brain I'm like slow down my

1052
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,279
body's like cool let's go faster

1053
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,319
I could stop it was such a terrible

1054
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,359
presentation I got to the end and I'm

1055
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,520
seeing people's eyes I could a couple of

1056
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,319
months like when I was like

1057
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,880
stop man

1058
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,740
people are like pointing at water like

1059
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,500
take a water bottle just anything

1060
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,740
and I'm like got it faster

1061
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,920
okay my first presentation was terrible

1062
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,960
but then it got better at it and got

1063
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,280
better

1064
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,859
but what I'm trying to tell you here is

1065
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,319
you have a tremendous opportunity be

1066
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,560
this besides Augusta is in my opinion

1067
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,500
the best b-sides in the nation

1068
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,859
you've got a huge opportunity to come to

1069
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,780
this conference one to learn from other

1070
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,440
people but I can guarantee you have

1071
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,900
something to share

1072
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,880
you have and you might be sitting there

1073
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,579
it's like well no I don't I'm new yeah

1074
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,920
but there's other new people

1075
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,920
you have a topic that you know better

1076
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,180
than me

1077
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,460
guarantee it

1078
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,099
tell me your version tell me your story

1079
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,579
on how did you develop the skills to get

1080
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:51,960
where you are

1081
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,660
that's what's interesting

1082
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,520
how many talks are you going to go to

1083
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,760
today where someone is releasing brand

1084
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,619
new o day

1085
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,040
probably not many and frankly even if

1086
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,800
they were it's probably not useful to

1087
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,480
the masses

1088
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,660
what's useful to most people is the

1089
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,300
here's this I don't want to say simple

1090
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,660
thing this thing that's simple to you

1091
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,460
but might not be simple to everybody

1092
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,660
else

1093
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,920
right

1094
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,400
I mean lock picking has been a thing for

1095
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,280
multiple millennia

1096
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,020
but you're still going to go there and

1097
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,660
learn how to do it maybe right

1098
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,599
so I would highly encourage you and it

1099
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,579
maybe it's not coming to an event like

1100
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,760
this maybe it's a blog post maybe it's a

1101
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,380
smaller thing maybe it's a lunch and

1102
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,180
learn at your office

1103
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,300
but I highly encourage you get out there

1104
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,900
and share what you know your version of

1105
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,920
the story is the interesting piece

1106
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,079
so sign up for these conferences next

1107
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,839
year volunteer to be a speaker

1108
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,160
um you know there's there's probably

1109
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,260
smaller events if this many people is

1110
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,460
scary

1111
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,859
but I highly encourage you get out there

1112
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:11,700
do a talk share what you have you have

1113
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,800
something interesting that I don't know

1114
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,380
you have something interesting that most

1115
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,720
of the people here don't know I look at

1116
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,140
the statistics for our red Siege website

1117
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,720
and I look at the blog posts

1118
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,140
the blog posts that have the most hits

1119
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,660
are what we blog post that we almost

1120
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,220
didn't do because we thought they were

1121
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,200
too simple

1122
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,819
but we have like a shortage in our

1123
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,560
industry we're trying to get more and

1124
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,599
more people into our industry to help

1125
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,079
out so this simple stuff works

1126
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,280
right

1127
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,720
and I know a lot of people you're like

1128
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,000
you know what I'll do it someday cool

1129
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,339
when

1130
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,140
are you going to put that stake in this

1131
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,760
that that's lying in the sand you know

1132
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,700
what like let me pick a day

1133
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,200
right it doesn't have to be today it

1134
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,880
doesn't have to be tomorrow but draw a

1135
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,200
line you're like look I want to do a

1136
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,420
talk between now and next year at

1137
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,780
Augusta I want to write a sort of blog I

1138
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,780
want to do informational tick tocks

1139
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,520
right whatever

1140
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,680
but get out there figure out what your

1141
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,260
plan is is going to be if you continue

1142
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,079
to take the same actions you're going to

1143
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,180
get the same results

1144
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,980
right if you want to change your life if

1145
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,720
you want to change your career but

1146
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,460
you're taking no actions to change it

1147
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,839
guess what

1148
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,280
you're going to come back here next year

1149
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,780
and you're going to have the same mental

1150
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,460
conversation in your head

1151
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,200
so get out there let me look around you

1152
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,599
there's people around you talk to them

1153
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,359
talk to the people at the booth I find

1154
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,579
at these conferences

1155
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:44,099
the most valuable thing is the hallway

1156
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,540
talk

1157
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,640
in fact I tell my employees when we go

1158
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,160
to conferences hey if you don't go to a

1159
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,380
single talk I'm okay with it I didn't

1160
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,900
tell you I didn't

1161
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,880
because there's so much valuable

1162
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,560
conversation that we have with other

1163
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,480
people going through the same struggles

1164
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,579
the same uh things that we're going

1165
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,619
through and and learning from that right

1166
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,200
where do you want to be the one thing

1167
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,960
you can't buy is more time

1168
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,599
your only resource in life you have

1169
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,339
exactly one

1170
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:15,960
time

1171
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,359
you traded for friendship you traded for

1172
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,760
money you traded for food you trade your

1173
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,260
time for that

1174
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,720
so make the the decision to spend your

1175
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,359
time making the changes that you want

1176
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,880
this is more specifically around the

1177
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,640
security career here but I'm trying to

1178
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,500
tell you here is there's a tremendous

1179
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,240
amount of opportunity

1180
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,420
and it doesn't have to be hard

1181
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,640
all of the things all of the attacks

1182
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,440
that I just showed you

1183
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,240
dead simple

1184
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,000
right not a single one of those was very

1185
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,200
difficult that if you didn't understand

1186
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,579
it

1187
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,800
it I'd be happy to explain it to you

1188
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,079
some more but none of that stuff was uh

1189
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,760
super complicated

1190
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,040
so in short give back okay uh that is my

1191
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,660
time I think do we have time for

1192
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,480
questions or no cool uh questions

1193
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,099
this is where I say Bueller but then I

1194
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,420
see a bunch of bunch of the younger

1195
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,380
people they're like where the hell is

1196
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,800
Bill there

1197
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,020
go for it

1198
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,220
so the um so the when I was talking

1199
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,900
about the app with the reverse

1200
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,700
engineering and that payload the payload

1201
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,619
was being verified on the server it was

1202
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:49,040
being verified in the server

1203
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,240
was there one thing that that kind of

1204
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,060
got you started like aha moment or

1205
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,319
something like that got you interested

1206
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:59,040
in in security yeah so and I'm going to

1207
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,540
answer a slightly different question

1208
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,400
from that the question I get all the

1209
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,500
time is where should I start

1210
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,680
and my response is well what is

1211
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,240
interesting to you

1212
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,700
because if I give you an answer and you

1213
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,880
hate that thing you're never gonna do it

1214
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,180
right find the thing in security and dig

1215
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,339
into that piece are you into web cool

1216
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,440
spend some time in web are you into

1217
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,359
reverse engineering there's a lot of

1218
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,740
blog posts to help you with that with

1219
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,540
those things are you into GRC whatever

1220
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,240
it might be pick the thing that's useful

1221
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,720
to you uh for me when I was a kid I

1222
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,400
would reverse engineer like video games

1223
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,560
to figure out how to make my little

1224
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,040
dudes faster right like like the fast I

1225
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,839
just little soccer game and the top

1226
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,960
speed was 99 but if I went in and edited

1227
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,059
the hex and change it to FF their speed

1228
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,099
was like 256. and I could just run

1229
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,020
around like mad it was awesome

1230
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,559
yeah

1231
00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:58,559
what's cyber security threats targeting

1232
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,240
our nation's polarizing models concerns

1233
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,040
what cyber security threat targeting our

1234
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,920
nation's just democracy uh strains me

1235
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,380
the most uh

1236
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,059
polarized democracy I don't know what

1237
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,040
that I don't know I think the biggest

1238
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,140
the the biggest thing I'm scared of is

1239
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,300
some of the um cyber threats against

1240
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,920
some of the critical infrastructure

1241
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,140
because that has the potential to impact

1242
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,180
you know Everyday People Power stuff

1243
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,500
like that okay

1244
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,000
cool we got people heading out there's

1245
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,680
