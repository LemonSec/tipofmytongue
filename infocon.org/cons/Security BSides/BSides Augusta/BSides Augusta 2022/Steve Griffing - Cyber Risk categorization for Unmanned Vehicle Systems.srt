1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,330
welcome Steve to the afternoon talk

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,980
[Applause]

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,759
welcome to this talk as you said I'm

4
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,200
Steve Griffin

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,420
um I'm going to be talking about some

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,620
work I did uh in the last spring and

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,860
doing some

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,760
categorization of unmanned systems and

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,480
doing working through the dod's RMF

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,719
process for these systems

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,719
and why

12
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,440
you would make certain decisions about

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,239
what

14
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,659
security controls to use for unmanned

15
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,080
systems

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,840
who I am

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,939
I've got done a lot of

18
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,520
work in cyber and

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,680
OT on the licensed professional engineer

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,619
and have

21
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,720
several certifications in the field

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,299
most of my experiences have been in the

23
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,979
dod specifically in the Navy but none of

24
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,840
this stuff that I am going to be

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,079
speaking about represents any the

26
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,420
opinion of the US government this is all

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,340
my opinions and

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,079
I'll make sure that's clear

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,500
all right

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,740
anyone who's done an authorization or

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,060
accreditation

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,079
um

33
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,259
process it'll probably be familiar with

34
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,459
the sixth now seven steps of the risk

35
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,679
management framework we're going to be

36
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,239
going over the first three the preparing

37
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,180
the categorizing and selecting that's

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,420
preparing all the the information that

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,280
that's the newest thing that they added

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,440
to the latest iteration of the nist

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,980
framework it used to be just categorize

42
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,160
select Implement assess authorize but

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,560
preparing is a significant chunk of work

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,860
and especially when not everyone wants

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,200
to play in these same set of rules or

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,260
play nice with each other

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,459
makes it a little harder

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
and then the other constraint we have

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,099
here is that

50
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:02,879
um

51
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,400
we're not talking traditional I.T

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,620
systems you've heard a little bit

53
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,220
earlier today the OT playbooks and uh um

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,159
the criticality of

55
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,780
operational technology and the

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,959
differences but what it comes down to is

57
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
the OT systems are not designed to

58
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,000
manipulate data

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,340
they use data to manipulate their

60
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,980
environment and to operate in their

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,459
environment

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,900
and that is why

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,780
um that's what makes them unique but it

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,560
also changes our priorities

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,560
for a control system

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
things like safety come into the

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,319
Forefront because

68
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,040
you're dealing with people and equipment

69
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,879
that have to operate in hostile

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,760
environments

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,200
and in around people that can be hurt by

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,420
it and you're

73
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,400
unlike in an office environment with a

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
computer if I crash it and just rebuild

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,540
it

76
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,819
um no harm no foul

77
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,540
in the real world where

78
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,060
we're dealing with Hardware that can

79
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,000
break we're dealing with people that can

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,419
get hurt

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,919
and our primary two references are going

82
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,160
to be the nist

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,460
882 on the

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,979
second revision is enforce the third

85
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,759
revision to that standard is currently

86
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,820
in draft and there it will be released

87
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,180
soon hopefully

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,400
um and then the other primary one is the

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,900
ISA 62443 series which is the industrial

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,419
equivalent to the government nist

91
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,419
publication

92
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,919
now

93
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,540
most times you think about a drones and

94
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,419
unmanned systems you're usually thinking

95
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,660
helicopters quadcopters airplanes

96
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,539
well I was not working with airplanes I

97
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,139
was working with boats

98
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,160
and things like this sail drone Explorer

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,479
which

100
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,400
you've seen it in the news a couple

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,979
times and just this past week there was

102
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,400
some video of one in the middle of Ivan

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,039
because that's what they're designed for

104
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,600
hunting and getting me talk dad weather

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,479
data from

106
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,979
inhospitable areas where you don't want

107
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,160
to sail your own pleasure craft into but

108
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,419
you can get really good information

109
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,680
um

110
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,259
the

111
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,600
DOD decided to use some and

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,580
that's and that's why I was tasked with

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,460
doing a risk management framework on

114
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,400
these it's like Pete awesome piece of

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
tech but never been in the government

116
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,100
service before so

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,919
coming from a very clean slate

118
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,900
and

119
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,860
then it it's it's a very smart very

120
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,620
robust piece of tech

121
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,160
but it is

122
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,860
ultimately a control system

123
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,860
not an I.T computer

124
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,780
and that's where we're getting to get

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,159
into the categorization

126
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,120
so

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,419
step one prepare

128
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,159
the biggest challenge with things

129
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,780
one guess

130
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,720
maybe read it off the screen

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,620
intellectual property who owns it who

132
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,440
owns the command and control who owns

133
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,080
anything that it picks up in its

134
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,160
environment

135
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,500
and those are different pieces of the

136
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,020
puzzle and so making sure that you have

137
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,099
all of that documented in writing

138
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,639
beforehand is vital

139
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,460
we've got that those locks out there and

140
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,039
first thing they tell you about picking

141
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,680
locks is you either have to own it

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,800
yourself or have written permission from

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,919
the person who does own it

144
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,199
same with this stuff if you don't have

145
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,520
written permission

146
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,319
it's not yours

147
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,660
and you can't even defend it

148
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,259
so

149
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,599
and if you want to get all the necessary

150
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,840
documentation the network diagrams the

151
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,759
engineering diagrams

152
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,319
the

153
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,660
code and all that

154
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,900
that you need to properly defend it you

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,080
you first have to get that permission

156
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,159
and working through those contracts

157
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,140
is why we hire lawyers

158
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,260
um so know a good lawyer work with the

159
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,700
teams know who to contact

160
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,899
contacting their c-suite and then

161
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,339
working downward into the technical

162
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,019
subject matter experts that you actually

163
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,700
who actually know what they're talking

164
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,399
about and what you what questions to ask

165
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,399
get to you where you can

166
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,640
get all of those things and then just

167
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
remind them of the conditions of the

168
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,620
contract they signed and usually that

169
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,200
helps bring them to the table

170
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,260
and one of the biggest

171
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,920
um

172
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,459
overlooked most overlooked people when

173
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,160
you're working with this is the

174
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,300
industrial engineers

175
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,980
they're not I.T guys they don't think

176
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,380
like it guys they didn't go to school

177
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,980
for computer science or cyber security

178
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,459
they went to school for robotics

179
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,279
so they spent more time stay studying

180
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
physics and

181
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,060
um

182
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,119
mechanics than they did coding

183
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,040
so they're going to think differently

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
than you are

185
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,700
but

186
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,560
without their help

187
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,440
you're not going to get your

188
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,320
um task done

189
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,040
and that's where and they can give you

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,839
Vital Information that those processing

191
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
instrumentation diagrams that actually

192
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,640
tell you what the robot is doing and

193
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,779
what controls what

194
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,820
and also if you're halfway around the

195
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,940
world

196
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,980
making meetings even virtual meetings is

197
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,660
challenging

198
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,399
all right now

199
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,120
getting into the actual categorization

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,959
the reason why you want to think of this

201
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,120
as a scada

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,660
which all right as which is a subset of

203
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,260
OT is because the architecture

204
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,160
you have the architect uh

205
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,920
architecture of Escada taken right from

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,959
the nist pub that they're standard

207
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
thing okay you've got a control center

208
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,600
over a wide area network to a set of

209
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
nodes and each node do I mean local

210
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,459
control

211
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,720
there

212
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,019
look at how you control a drone

213
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,640
control center

214
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,100
over a wide area network

215
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,160
to a fleet of

216
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,560
ships each one doing autonomous control

217
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,980
and autonomous operations on their own

218
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,620
with supervisory control

219
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,300
it's basically the exact same

220
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
architecture and therefore

221
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,740
yeah it is a very good place to start

222
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,860
when you are trying to secure it because

223
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,839
the same a lot of the same challenges

224
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
are you're going to have you're not

225
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,820
going to have easy access to the

226
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,079
endpoints you're not going to have a

227
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,240
standard it

228
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,740
protocols

229
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,800
you might might not but more likely

230
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,300
you're going to be dealing with real

231
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,200
time

232
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,959
protocols real time

233
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,760
um

234
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,660
interfaces

235
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,040
and you always have to deal with the

236
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,459
environment

237
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,480
all right so

238
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,060
and that is why we're categorizing it as

239
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,800
a skoda

240
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,120
but

241
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,560
nobody puts a drone anywhere

242
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,660
just for its own sake

243
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,260
it it will have a payload

244
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,459
and that is a typically a standard it

245
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,360
looks a lot more like your it database

246
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,760
or an I.T system so you're going to have

247
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,320
to secure that like a it system

248
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,980
and

249
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,019
you can't just

250
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,920
glob it into one system you have to

251
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,220
separate and

252
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,500
find that distinction between the bus

253
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,660
and the payload

254
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,480
um that and

255
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
you'll and there should be a hard

256
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
um

257
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,720
differentiation so that one doesn't

258
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,600
share information with the other

259
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,760
um for both security and

260
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,540
this organization reasons

261
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,820
now then oh let's get it into that

262
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,360
um

263
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,779
that bus because

264
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,980
a lot of other people have talked about

265
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,380
how to secure that payload

266
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,820
here

267
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,019
we have the our classic Purdue reference

268
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:12,360
architecture which is gonna work it's

269
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,540
designed for a manufacturing plant

270
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,779
but it kind of does apply here because

271
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,600
you still have that control that layer

272
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,940
zero which would be your Rudder and

273
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,980
propeller

274
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,040
um pushing it through the water

275
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,860
your layer one your that's your motor

276
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,420
controllers

277
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,480
and Layer Two supervisory control on the

278
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,920
local to the craft

279
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,079
and then

280
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,239
you have a large gap

281
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,519
um to your supervisory control where you

282
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,980
have controlling multiple

283
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,699
systems at the same time

284
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,480
I like the way the ISA does it better

285
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,060
than Mist

286
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,600
um Isa breaks it down into zones and

287
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
conduits

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,639
where each Zone and

289
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,980
each

290
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,019
vessel is going to be its own Zone

291
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,019
and each of those zones is connected

292
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,100
with a secured conduit a secured path to

293
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
the other parts and by breaking it into

294
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,360
that model you have a lot more finite

295
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,000
and a lot more discrete control because

296
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,079
one drone in one area might have a

297
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,899
different risk profile than one in

298
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,139
another the risks to a drone going into

299
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,380
a hurricane are different from the risks

300
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,560
of the Drone sitting in a contested

301
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,979
straight

302
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,220
as you can see

303
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,060
both recent news photos that top one is

304
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,060
a sail drone in Ian

305
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,240
doing 35 knots under sale

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,220
in the middle of a hurricane

307
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,139
second one

308
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,360
another sail drone

309
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,420
getting investigated by our friends in

310
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,959
the Middle East

311
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,079
um so very different risk profile

312
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,019
the physical security of that Sanctus

313
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,339
cell drone

314
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,139
had to be augmented

315
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,779
and you can check the news for that

316
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,240
the other one

317
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
um

318
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
sorry

319
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,380
I just

320
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,040
put a

321
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,680
random citation in the middle of my

322
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,100
slide but

323
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,459
these risk trials are different so being

324
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,940
able to categorize them differently with

325
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,559
different zones is important

326
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,980
and that

327
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,400
so

328
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,619
that is

329
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,678
um

330
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,959
any questions on

331
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,160
why you would use this and how how to

332
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
categorize drones and like these things

333
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
while I was talking about surface

334
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,539
vessels it's applicable with any whether

335
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,980
it's your little

336
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,220
drone or a big Fleet and it's

337
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,960
so questions

338
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,740
comments

339
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,960
yep

340
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,059
okay yeah so so the payload is going to

341
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,620
be it depends on what the payload is and

342
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,480
that could that's depending on what the

343
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,760
um the the owner or client of that drone

344
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,200
wants

345
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,780
um like these drones were designed to

346
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,900
pick up a lot of weather information so

347
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,940
whether a whole bunch of weather sensors

348
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,200
and that type of stuff and it's going to

349
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,340
process it send it back keep the but

350
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,679
because it's an I.T system you're going

351
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,780
to look at it from confidentiality

352
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,559
Integrity availability whereas on the

353
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,799
bus side on the actual

354
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,840
vessel you're worried about that safety

355
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,140
availability all of much higher than

356
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,059
your confidentiality and that's why

357
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,240
because there's different risk profiles

358
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,000
you have to

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,900
deal with them separately

360
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,360
okay

361
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,679
yes

362
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
first you then

363
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,620
yes

364
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,600
right

365
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,020
yeah good question uh your typical scada

366
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,500
is a fixed environment either local or

367
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,460
even a broad but uh your challenges are

368
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,900
going to be more in your transmission

369
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,760
path

370
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,539
um so here we've got a Radio based set

371
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,500
off satellites transmission paths and as

372
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,660
long as you're able to maintain that

373
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,580
transmission

374
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,419
it's going to be similar to

375
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,360
a the other challenges of if it's just

376
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,059
infrastructure that it's a pass through

377
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,980
but

378
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,740
um good you just have to be mindful of

379
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,580
the just the differences in it

380
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,780
yes

381
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,179
well talk to the expert but really you

382
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,980
need to get a firm understanding of the

383
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,020
um engineering side

384
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,200
and then an understanding of the Cyber

385
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,059
site though there are two very different

386
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,559
fields but having

387
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
talking to

388
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,880
organizations like that information the

389
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,100
international Society of Automation and

390
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,700
getting the hard engineering training

391
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,720
and then go into someone like Sans or uh

392
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,660
and getting that cyber

393
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,160
and then you can bring them together but

394
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,080
trying to just start there you've got

395
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,140
too much foundational information on

396
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,080
both sides that you can't just start

397
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,240
without getting a foundation on first

398
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,780
yeah

399
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,520
uh

400
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,260
well

401
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,840
let's see

402
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,280
a question for my audience

403
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,120
what are the two

404
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,780
primary

405
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,059
resources and standards that I touched

406
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,178
on

407
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
yep good job

408
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,340
and what is the biggest challenge with

409
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,039
trying to get information about a system

410
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,119
[Applause]

411
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,120
all right

412
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,039
sure

413
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,960
for the part that I I did not get all

414
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,020
the way through authorization

415
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,200
I spent about four months working

416
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
through those three steps

417
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,500
so
