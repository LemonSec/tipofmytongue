and my mics aren't on so this one on

12
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,420

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,739
all right thank you for coming out my

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,180
name is will back this is mechanical

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,980
engineering 501

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,899
um turning your oh wait no that's Will's

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,160
joke he asked me to make it before I

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,780
walk in that's my son in the front row

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,219
over there

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,619
um Tyler talk his Broken Arrow and

21
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,820
they're all now laughing at him

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,760
fantastic uh Broken Arrow so that's the

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
Army term back in the 60s so if the

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,740
American forces are overrun they would

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,180
send it out over the radio to ask for

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,520
any and all air support in whatever

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,619
means whether it's a B-52 for blanket

28
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,140
bombing Napalm or even a Cessna just

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,520
giving a little bit of guidance to the

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,020
American troops would know which way to

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,880
navigate away from the enemy

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,820
and I say that because working in the

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,159
Cyber field a lot of people come to us

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,720
and say you know I've got this situation

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,420
and before it used to be fix my desktop

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,220
back when I'm dating myself I'll realize

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,259
but back when we had desktops that

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,240
people would build aside from Gamers and

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,619
crypto miners

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,960
building your machine was an issue and

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,579
the common person comes a cyber security

42
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,619
person an I.T person that asked him to

43
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,700
build it

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,280
that's now shifted from fixing things

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,820
generally laptops and phones or

46
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,020
non-repairable generally ifixit.com

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,340
might help

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,439
but now it's fixed my situation whether

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,380
it's I'm being gang stalked on Instagram

50
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,880
or

51
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,860
you know my ex knows everything I'm

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,840
doing on iMessage

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,160
you know I think my account's been

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,760
hacked can you come help me fix this and

55
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
that talks relevant because here in in

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,379
Augusta between the national lab and the

57
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,440
things that go on over at Fort Gordon we

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,140
might be we like I'm still in it but we

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,480
might be the

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,819
Superior at building drones that go deep

61
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,440
underground to take nuclear measurements

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,060
or we might be able to determine how

63
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,200
many

64
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,840
people of Interest are living in a house

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,760
in Pakistan based on the water drawn

66
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
power draw through sources and methods

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,379
but when you leave that skiff life and

68
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,120
come back out to your car and start to

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,319
drive home and in Georgia you can't

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,540
touch your phone for however long it

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,700
takes to get back into your house

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,319
that's when you truly get back into the

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,900
civilian world and you might be a GS

74
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,239
1510 looking at something truly in-depth

75
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,819
in technical but once you get home oh

76
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,099
again because he's here I didn't know

77
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,120
you can make phone calls through

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,060
Snapchat and I was a

79
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,879
comms expert for CIA

80
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,099
for counterintelligence group but we

81
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,599
didn't know that because we don't play

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,239
with Snapchat and you know you can still

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,860
learn from people I didn't know you can

84
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,319
make phone calls through PS4 no idea

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,640
never thought to make phone calls

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,700
because I'm an adult I have a phone

87
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,920
but you can and you can actually stalk

88
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,780
people and see what's going on you one

89
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,220
person

90
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,099
she built a scraper to see how long

91
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,840
people had been online the amount of

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,159
times they're spending on video games

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,700
and took that report to the judge to say

94
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,739
uh you know this person claims they

95
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,239
can't get a job but they spend 80 hours

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,239
a week on Call of Duty Black Ops zombies

97
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,700
they can obviously get a job

98
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,500
so

99
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,599
from all that when they come to us and

100
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,519
say can you help us our inclinations say

101
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,739
yes and we want to do something

102
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,959
so on the job a lot of us have seen this

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
you basically sign your life away and

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
the graphic looks a lot better on small

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,420
screen than big screen you basically say

106
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,099
you consent to all monitoring and then

107
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,900
after leaving the intelligence community

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,420
and working Insider Threat by God yes

109
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,519
they mean they can see everything so

110
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,100
you've got Splunk you can see all if

111
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,199
it's set up correctly which if it's not

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,000
it's a lot of money and that's why the

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
splunking engineers also have a huge

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,060
salary

115
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,100
but you can see every bitten byte that

116
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,300
goes to and from all the email

117
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,639
attachments websites visited then

118
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,820
drilling down with o365 which

119
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,160
that's not vulnerable one bit but you

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,660
can see all the email all the teams

121
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,160
chats away

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,900
active messages all that can be

123
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,880
harvested remotely without the end user

124
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,300
knowing what's going on with druva you

125
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,780
can connect remotely previously uh

126
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,940
before the virus you would actually have

127
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,800
to do dead box forensics collect the Box

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,259
image it and then look at the data and

129
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,880
with endpoint software you can now go

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
out remotely collect just the files of

131
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
interest and look to see is this person

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
a flight risk for leaving the company is

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,620
this a counter Espionage case are they

134
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,759
looking

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,340
to take our proprietary research and

136
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,660
then sell it to the competitor or take

137
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,460
it with them for a new job

138
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,860
and even McAfee you can see which USB

139
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,540
device has been plugged in

140
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,820
what was copied to it and where the data

141
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,199
went and you can get the full pattern of

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,639
life without the end user ever knowing

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,120
it but again going back one slide

144
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,639
you agreed to that as part of the job

145
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,000
that doesn't work at home people

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
should have a reasonable expectation on

147
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
privacy and legally they do

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,520
and I've got this in here for a pause I

149
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,280
gave this talk at Defcon in one of the

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,560
not critique suggestion was for the

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,020
short version the TBR version if you

152
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,400
need resources if you go back to the

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,780
Augusta Airport if you're flying out of

154
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,440
here

155
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,960
oh I heard this talk on escaping

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,759
domestic digital abuse

157
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,180
the takeaways are go askgrows.com

158
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,560
safeascape.org it's a collection of

159
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,460
people

160
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,620
like myself there's the founders working

161
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,880
for DARPA

162
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,520
people tied to Facebook Instagram

163
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,960
Twitter to help work to squash some of

164
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,820
the issues people are having

165
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,400
if you want to volunteer we always need

166
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,440
more volunteers help at safeascape.org

167
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
or if you know somebody who needs help

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,340
help at safeascape.org we'll parse the

169
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,179
email where it goes

170
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,680
of this if you've taken any cyber

171
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,120
security class you're familiar with the

172
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
Triad data configiality data

173
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,680
availability and data Integrity I've got

174
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,020
a hundred plus slides my old Mentor did

175
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,620
eight slides in four hours

176
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,180
a lot of people falling asleep in that

177
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,580
class so you lose attention after six

178
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,560
seconds I have a lot to cover this is a

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,319
basically a week of counterintelligence

180
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,940
technical counter surveillance crammed

181
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,979
into 50 minutes the slides are available

182
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,539
if you want I'll give my email at the

183
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,380
end

184
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,400
uh but we've got this we all know that

185
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,280
so from that Triad the risk mitigation

186
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,960
principles for the domestic abuse front

187
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,300
you need to control the environment

188
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,520
be aware of identity theft and you have

189
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,080
to make sure you have data availability

190
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,100
unlike AWS as your maybe digitalocean

191
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,100
and maybe how the NSA has a site out in

192
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,060
Utah

193
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,800
that data related to these specific

194
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,020
domestic cases that's the only USB drive

195
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,759
that's the only hard drive you have from

196
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
this you have to make sure you make

197
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,060
additional copies because if you lose

198
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,280
that the person you're helping won't

199
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
have any evidence whatsoever of the

200
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,258
abuse

201
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,940
but out of everything you have to

202
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,400
control the environment where you can

203
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
and from that it breaks down to another

204
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,880
three points the personal security the

205
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,419
data security and social media leaks

206
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,280
personal security is obviously the most

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,220
important one the horrible example but

208
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,660
the flight that went down the Malaysian

209
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,780
317 flight that vanished oh everyone's

210
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,580
dead but we have the Black Box it

211
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,380
doesn't matter everyone's dead you have

212
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,639
to take care of yourself first and

213
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,020
foremost

214
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,120
now cyber practitioners this is one of

215
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
the newer slides we've refined the

216
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,840
process at safe Escape you have to look

217
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,520
for the iocs just like when you're

218
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,440
dealing in a sock environment one is

219
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,699
this person

220
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,680
why are they concerned

221
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
how do you think this is happening

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,940
and what are the indicators of

223
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,860
compromise why are they think that

224
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,720
something is going on

225
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,180
and we've learned over time improbable

226
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,060
doesn't mean impossible we've most of

227
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,000
the cases are just coincidence

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,740
there's some true hacking and we've had

229
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,020
some black hat hackers who actually

230
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,660
pursued the victim digitally to erase

231
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,179
the evidence of their abuse with some

232
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,640
zero days they've earned some unreported

233
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,919
exploits in order to try to erase

234
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,839
evidence and he kept reconnecting her

235
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,458
devices to make sure that pictures of

236
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,919
her abuse were erased it was a cat and

237
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,399
mouse game but that was a very unique

238
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,320
situation that was one out of hundreds

239
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,040
but it did happen

240
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,899
so kind of tying this into last night

241
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,399
you never have to ask permission to

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,440
leave a dangerous situation

243
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,540
getting off the exit means if you think

244
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,120
you're in danger it's okay to leave no

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,860
bad situation ever get better by

246
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,180
sticking around

247
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,860
you know last night looking at driving

248
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,959
down here from Charlotte we were looking

249
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,200
at I-77 and looking at I-20 westbound

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,420
and we'd have driven straight through

251
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,800
the middle of the hurricane tropical

252
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,019
storm coming over to here or we wait

253
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,640
till the next morning get up early and

254
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
drive in

255
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,760
if I've just spent two 12-hour days

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,940
worrying about 0365 volt about a remote

257
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,680
connection vulnerability for a computer

258
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm never going to see plus a new

259
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,459
hypervisor vulnerability

260
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,380
again on thoroughly dispersed machines

261
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,839
sitting on AWS cloud

262
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,580
why would I risk my personal life to

263
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,260
drive through a storm to speak when I

264
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,360
can just wait 12 hours I didn't ask

265
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,160
permission it was just we're going to

266
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,680
wait that was a smart call

267
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,120
same thing if someone's in a bad

268
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,100
situation leave first make it to the

269
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,899
next day and then start to rebuild from

270
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,420
there getting off the X again this is a

271
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,779
domestic abuse digital case however

272
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,420
have your bug out bag pack just like for

273
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,519
a hurricane if we had your wallet your

274
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,700
keys important papers babies passports

275
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,180
babies documents babies vaccine records

276
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,820
your phone and the charger because my

277
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,700
iPhone both life is terrible

278
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,200
and you want to keep the devices with

279
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
you but you have to consider what if

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,220
they're stalker wear some of the people

281
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,839
I don't like to say victims some of the

282
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,519
clients we've worked with been very

283
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,980
ingenious one of them was a

284
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,339
vet and she kept her alternate phone

285
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,560
documents and prepaid credit cards in

286
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,839
the safe her medicine safe in her office

287
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,200
and said that if my ex breaks in to the

288
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,940
office breaks into the safe

289
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,980
they're not just breaking and entering

290
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,600
this is a major feeling because there's

291
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,279
controlled substances and the police are

292
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,779
going to respond much differently than

293
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,399
just keeping these documents in my car

294
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,019
now that said here's where we want to

295
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,220
split a little bit we've got a person

296
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,959
leaving a bad environment

297
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,579
and then we've got what if that person

298
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,620
leaves the house leaves the apartment

299
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,420
leaves the assigned housing watch

300
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,380
through

301
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,880
a couple of things first you want to

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,260
change your passwords that's obvious I

303
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,820
want to say that a lot you probably

304
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,959
won't hear it in your sleep I want to

305
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,940
say it in my sleep you want to change to

306
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,640
Locks and codes to your alarm panels the

307
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,220
third one added in because it seems so

308
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,420
bizarre again being in the cyber

309
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,540
security field there is a flap there was

310
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,339
there's a flap but you pull it down on

311
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,079
the garage door panel to enter your code

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,079
to unlock your garage and raise it and

313
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,740
it said if you forget your code do this

314
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,899
to gain access right there on the door I

315
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,120
mean username admin password and right

316
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
there hard stamped at the manufacturer

317
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,980
that's a bad thing if you're uh if their

318
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,500
person has a shared garage door opener

319
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,839
with someone else when the

320
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,820
when the locksmith comes out that's

321
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,380
something else to remember to get

322
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,180
re-keyed this is physical perimeter

323
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,820
hardening first and foremost the police

324
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,440
getting a phone call this person came

325
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,480
back into my house with a key that's one

326
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,519
thing but they broke in because I change

327
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,380
the locks they're going to respond much

328
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,360
differently

329
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,040
now from there

330
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,740
on a known safe machine and a known safe

331
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,720
Network change your security passwords

332
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,019
and questions

333
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,620
meaning

334
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,019
something you wouldn't find from a

335
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,880
genealogy or ancestry.com or something

336
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,220
posted on Facebook

337
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,560

338
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
okay it's Americans we're conditioned to

339
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
always tell the truth and for those of

340
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,079
us who've been through polygraphs

341
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,240
they don't want the truth for four hours

342
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
they want for eight hours because they

343
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
get paid for the full day but you can't

344
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,980
say that wait I did say that so it's

345

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,860
river something they're not looking for

353
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,540
the truth they're just looking for the

354
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,100
right answer that you've put in it's

355
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,380
okay to lie about this my niece is over

356

358
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,380
online

359
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,420
except to your mom because she knows

360
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,760
where you live

361
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,740
okay so locksmith is coming the

362
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,180
apartment

363
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,980
managers coming they're changing the

364
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,959
locks while you're waiting

365
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,019
look at your router have your technical

366
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,700
friend look at your router

367
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,959
and here's where I'm going to start

368
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,720
saying capture evidence if necessary the

369
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
only things connected should be things

370
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,320
you recognize so here you've got a

371
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,880
Galaxy phone

372
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,160
an iPhone named PC because separate

373
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,899
conversation if you name it colonel

374
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,459
Smith's phone now you're beeping out to

375
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,899
the top of the target list when you can

376
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,040
to a

377
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,019
uh say a Starbucks who goes to Starbucks

378
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,100
but

379
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,019
you're still oh this guy is important to

380
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,700
the military let's sniff his traffic

381
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,880
with Wireshark versus PC phone who wants

382
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,639
to look at that so this is good this is

383
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,380
a normal looking network if you see

384
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,019
something unusual stop call law

385
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,920
enforcement because if you've got a

386
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,200
bug in the house of remote camera

387
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,779
that's also a felony and as

388
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,120
professionals we stop we get the law

389
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,440
enforcement involved because we don't

390
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,000
want to tamper with evidence

391
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,180
you can also if you feel like it look at

392
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,680
the law to see what device has been

393
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,779
coming and going through the network

394
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,060
what else is connected what's going on

395
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,500
that you don't regularly see

396
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,180
again the standard disclaimer I can't

397
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,160
talk about every log location for every

398
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
router in production Google it

399
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,420
another option would be

400
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,220
if you feel comfortable if you have your

401
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,260
person has the time get a new router go

402
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,839
to Comcast I know I know go to Cox

403
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,420
Infinity wait for Infinity get a new

404
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,079
router get a new IP address and some

405
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,360
isps will let you set a safety phrase

406
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,920
challenge in response so that if you

407
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,339
call in only you would know that

408
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,019
take note of what it is because if you

409
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,420
forget it you won't get any help Source

410
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,940
trust me

411
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,720
Now on iPhone 6 uh yeah iOS 16

412
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
they've got a great new feature and this

413
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,660
is

414
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,779
mitigated eliminated a lot of the intake

415
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,339
issues we had a lot of the stalking

416
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,420
issues

417
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,519
you go to settings privacy and security

418
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,699
safety check and then emergency reset

419
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,320
that just nukes everything that's had

420
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,019
access to your phone and mating managing

421
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,800
sharing and access

422
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,839
you can go to lockdown mode

423
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,120
filtering out iMessages so you don't get

424
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,339
fished shared albums all the data that's

425
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,019
shared

426
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,519
that gets it off so it's not

427
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,380
inadvertently leaked out there is a uh

428
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,320
there was there was a

429
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,420
NATO person who had been doing sensitive

430
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,760
slight exploitation over in Iraq

431
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,399
didn't know it grateful he admitted to

432
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
the class not admit but

433
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,779
he had been taking pictures of sources

434
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,639
stuffed and things

435
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,920
and that family album was shared out or

436
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,720
that shared album was sent out to Memaw

437
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,000
Papa and the whole family of stuff they

438
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,260
probably shouldn't see probably a little

439
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,820
bit classified but there you go because

440
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,339
this shared setting plus you don't take

441
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,019
your iPhone to combat but that's a whole

442
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,399
different issue for another class for

443
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,820
another day

444
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,120
um

445
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
the lower versions of the iOS iOS 15 and

446
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,339
Below same thing

447
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,160
go to settings and look to see where you

448
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,899
have dropped copies of messages there is

449
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,519
a case had been ongoing for five years

450
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,519
that put actually got me into this field

451
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,880
and the person's iMessage have been drop

452
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,339
copied to her laptop but also to the

453
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,040
iMac left behind at her ex's house so

454
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,839
everything she was doing iMessage and

455
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
then her email he was getting and then

456
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,100
presenting as evidence as to why she

457
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,899
shouldn't have the children so she was

458
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,100
going out for friends on Friday night

459
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,480
and getting a babysitter

460
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
she got served with a change of custody

461
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,740
papers for you know you left the kids at

462
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,000
home on a Friday night with the unknown

463
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,259
person you're not fit to be a mother

464
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,420
multiply that over multiple cases over

465
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,740
five years

466
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,199
range of resources and it's exhausting

467
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,660
but talking to a technical professional

468
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,120
here's where the leak is let's fix it we

469
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,699
also ran a honey pot trap where

470
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,440
honestly we

471
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,800
her person and I talked offline we went

472
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,779
to WebMD pulled three random diseases

473
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,939
Channel a channel B Channel C we

474
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,799
discussed or she discussed having these

475
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,439
symptoms when we ascertained that this

476
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,540
is the one that her ex-husband came and

477
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,859
said you're unfit to have the children

478
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,079
because of this okay we know it's this

479
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,579
Channel That's leaked out let's look at

480
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,919
where it's going that got turned over to

481
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,199
law enforcement CSI I backed out because

482
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,099
I don't want to deal with law

483
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,119
enforcement

484
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,520
and things went from there she's got her

485
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,199
life back all because again I want to

486
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,000
change her password not victim always

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,500
change your password if you're unsure

488
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,240
but something like this makes a huge

489
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,100
difference part two on the iPhone

490
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,500
is fantastic in that you can be on your

491
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,080
Mac you have a text message and then

492
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,280
have it propagate through all your

493
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,140
devices the downside is the exact same

494
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,419
thing happens where you can forward your

495
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,760
text messages to multiple devices again

496
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,320
if you're helping this person and see

497
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,100
that

498
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,260
their ex thinks their cue from James

499
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,700
Bond and all they did was enable a

500
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,200
toggle button at his device really

501
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,299
that's not hacking

502
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,000
but again take your screenshot call law

503
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,620
enforcement and then let them deal with

504
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,940
it but now you know where the leak is

505
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,160
coming from

506
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,960
and again you've got your blue Force

507
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,240
tracker in your pocket if you're sharing

508
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,419
your location with unknown people like

509
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,700
Life360 something goes on and your ex

510
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,320
knows everything it's going

511
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,360
it's probably like 360 Apple has this by

512
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,860
default same for the shared family

513
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,120
albums

514
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,740
make sure those are disabled as well you

515
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,240
want to start mitigating the leak and

516
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,080
controlling the access

517
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
same thing for Android

518
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,500
you would go to recently used devices

519
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,059
see where you're logged in

520
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,820
and this was a fun one

521
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,520
show of hands Has anyone used Google

522
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,059
takeout

523
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,140
all right what does Google takeout do

524
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,320
what do you mean by all

525
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
I would toss it but liability so lock

526
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,580
pick set thank you

527
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,780
use it responsibility responsible

528
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,919
by everything all he literally meant all

529
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,539
we would have throwaway counts for the

530
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,940
troops to use it NATO

531
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,799
so they would use it for two weeks in

532
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,900
class they'd be a week two week month

533
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,240
break reactivate the accounts wipe them

534
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,919
and then I would have them pull Google

535
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,799
takeout to show that here's what you did

536
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,960
and then two weeks ago here's what this

537
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,280
person did for training in two weeks

538
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,600
before so that if you lost control of

539
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,980
your Google account while you're

540
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,360
deployed

541
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,640
everything is out there

542
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,520
which is fantastic if it's your person

543
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,260
you're working with has been accused of

544
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,419
something you can pull down from the

545
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,160
Google servers authoritatively here's

546
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,559
everything done which is fantastic

547
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,120
conversely if they're looking the x is

548
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,440
looking for information on your person

549
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,419
it's still everything as well so it's

550
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,000
the good and the bad

551
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,760
Apple occasionally has this apple backup

552
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,380
data same thing a lot more security

553
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,740
controls but it is the same thing and I

554
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,120
know that you know picking on my son

555
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
because I'm grateful he showed up

556
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,840
because

557
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,640
I don't get to teach my son very often

558
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,660
uh but it does like there was a we got a

559
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,820
Wonder Woman ad like back in 2000

560
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,919
because I pulled it for my account I got

561
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,020
a Wonder Woman game ad your sister

562
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,940
clicked on it so it shows here are the

563
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,919
four stats and here's the ones that she

564
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,840
clicked on it gets that granular for

565
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,679
what data is actually stored

566
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,380
and I'm looking at time I've got a lot

567
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,820
of ground to cover

568
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,860
he broke his iPhone in New Mexico his

569
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,660
iPad in New Mexico

570
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,120
I'm in Charlotte I'm downloading is old

571
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
data because he was like eight or nine

572
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,179
ten whatever

573
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,220
and I could tell like whatever video

574
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,840
game he was level he was trying to beat

575
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,059
that granule of a full forensic backup

576
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,980
was pulled down from the cloud to the

577
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,500
very point where his phone broke

578
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,720
and apple wasn't forthcoming with what

579
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,820
they do forensically for backups and

580
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,740
that's when the light bulb came on if I

581
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,960
can get a full copy of this device

582
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,059
remotely and apple isn't featuring this

583
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,700
yet how can we use that

584
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,500
at the company

585
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,120
for collection because now I don't have

586
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,559
to go first anyway

587
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,660
the amount of data that you can use to

588
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,160
protect yourself in court or the amount

589
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,660
of data that can be used against you

590
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,160
it's all the same it depends on the

591
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,520
optic

592
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,200
and this one same thing for Facebook

593
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
everyone some people love their Facebook

594
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,640
you go to account settings security

595
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,500
active sessions see everywhere you're

596
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,539
logged in there's a lot of places people

597
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:39,179
that have logged in onto Facebook don't

598
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,700
realize they're there

599
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,299
in we've only got 45 minutes left I

600
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,159
don't have time to touch everything but

601
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,179
literally

602
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,039
so many places that can be logged in

603
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,600
that people can Shadow what you're doing

604
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,580
unless you're doing that case in point

605
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,740
Georgia Tech Hotel went to use one of

606
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,380
the shared iMacs and somebody who had

607
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,500
their math their PHD paper in cyber

608
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,620
security remain logged into Facebook so

609
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,059
yeah

610
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,240
this is one of the holy of holies there

611
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,460
is a ZIP file on Facebook that contains

612
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,200
you can read as well as I can read it to

613
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,539
you but contains records of granular

614
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,640
details for all of your calls and text

615
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,799
messages between you and whoever for the

616
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,320
past year plus again

617
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
if

618
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,580
you're a pro athlete and someone's

619
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,080
accused you of doing something you've

620
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,120
got an authority of sourcing here's the

621
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,460
actual calls here's what's actually gone

622
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,320
on you pull it from Facebook it's

623
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,020
authoritative conversely if someone's

624
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,640
looking for information to use against

625
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,900
you or to say you've done something

626
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,640
wrong that's also there that's why

627
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,780
you've got to make sure that Facebook

628
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,200
password is changing locked down

629
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,299
a little bit easier here but going to an

630
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,760
iMac or going to a Mac laptop if you go

631
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,679
to keychain in the username and password

632
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,179
if you search your laptop people should

633
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,780
know it and then you go to keychain find

634
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,580
the Wi-Fi password Facebook password

635
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,860
Gmail doesn't matter

636
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,299
and then you type in the username

637
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,280
password for that laptop in clear text

638
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,320
you get to see the password that that

639
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,179
person thought was there protected so

640
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,340
again change the password it's stored in

641
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,020
so many places for your convenience

642
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,059
you're not even sure where everything is

643
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,320
the one percent of the cases I talked

644
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,700
about earlier he had full physical

645
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,400
access to her laptop he enabled sharing

646
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,559
on Mac go to settings sharing users and

647
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,960
groups to look at those two

648
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,780
he gave himself full remote login remote

649
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,120
remote management so her battery life is

650
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,640
terrible everything every copy and paste

651
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,980
every logon he had a full remote SSH so

652
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,919
anytime she was logged on he was able to

653
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,159
Shadow everything she was doing online

654
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
flip side is the oh it's going to

655
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,419
compliment but the person

656
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,340
his uh

657
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,320
gpg key that he left on there to

658
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,659
activate the remote hacking was actually

659
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,220
under his true name on Roots so there's

660
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,140
your evidence

661
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,760
going further for the person you want to

662
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,980
go social to the accounts and look and

663
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,120
see what's running on the logon

664
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,020
this one I like I was working with a

665
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,820
local

666
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,440
Pi a long time ago

667
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,760
he gave me a USB drive

668
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,400
and this is a deleted text message

669
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
saying make sure you delete your text

670
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,179
messages that the Pi had deleted from

671
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,460
the USB drive that he gave to me I ran

672
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,320
this Grill and he's able to recover that

673
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,059
so if you're in a contentious case you

674
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,179
don't want to just share it used USB you

675
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,400
want to use New Media the ten dollars

676
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,919
you spend at Walmart for clean versus I

677
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,320
think it's okay it's ten dollars versus

678
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,900
data security

679
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,820
we talked about Facebook helped a

680
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,980
neighbor move a 65-inch TV that began

681
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,320
picking on my son he got a 55-inch TV

682
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,260
for him and his he and his twin sister

683
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,900
Christmas a few years back that was the

684
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,460
second TV

685
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,520
the first TV your dad put in the cart at

686
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,620
Walmart and the weight of the TV kind of

687
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,659
bent and you know flat screens are

688
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,600
fragile be honest here yeah so that one

689
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,059
got returned because a nice big crack

690
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,799
down the middle

691
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,320
so anyway the person's moving a 65-inch

692
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,780
TV left the TV behind sold on Facebook

693
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,159
Marketplace

694
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,100
and the attorney told me they were still

695
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,320
logged into Twitter in Facebook why

696
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,659
someone needs to see Twitter on 65 inch

697
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,340
TV I don't know

698
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,320
but you've got to consider if it's a bad

699
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,000
domestic situation you have to log out

700
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,760
of all the edge devices

701
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,820
something else to consider with Facebook

702
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,559
there's some repositories on GitHub also

703
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,960
on oscent framework.com

704
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,760
you can take the aggregate of Facebook

705
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,059
IG Instagram Twitter and look and see

706
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,799
when someone's working when they're

707
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,179
sleeping when they're prevently posting

708
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,960
if they're posting after 5 30 P.M Monday

709
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,179
through Friday and they're silent from

710
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,700
eight to five are they working in a

711
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,720
skiff

712
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,000
or on the other side for the

713
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,740
counterterrorism side you can see okay

714
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,480
this person's betting down on these

715
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,760
hours were they sleeping or if you're a

716
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,080
little bit unscrupulous you can say okay

717
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,880
Tom Brady didn't sleep well last night

718
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,860
I'm going a bit on the Green Bay Packers

719
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,299
instead of the Bucks because based on

720
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,400
the Sleep Cycle would never do that she

721
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,140
was a little scuzzy to me but that's

722
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,299
still there that's implied data from

723
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,120
Facebook that's already out there

724
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,860
we talked about family and friends data

725
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,120
leaking

726
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,740
see a lot of this actually in the

727
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,200
military and some in the IC of hey Mom's

728
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,760
going here don't tell anyone Dad's going

729
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,200
here well if you post it on Facebook of

730
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,720
don't tell anyone dude it's online

731
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,279
so if you're saying you know my

732
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,500
daughter's under this issue but she's

733
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,419
going out tonight with her friends down

734
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:37,799
to

735
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,440
Frontier in Stockbridge well right there

736
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,900
now the Hostile Target knows they're

737
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,039
going there they don't have to hack

738
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,480
anything because someone else shared the

739
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,000
data for you

740
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,620
something else just like onboarding

741
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,840
off-boarding at corporations if they've

742
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,820
had access to the ring doorbell

743
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,740
has anyone worked with a ring doorbell

744
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,220
data

745
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,340
anyone set one up

746
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,059
nobody in the audience has a ring

747
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,020
doorbell

748
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,419
one person

749
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,980
what's that

750
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,919
right the camera quality is amazing the

751
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,900
audio quality is even better like it's

752
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,580
Crystal Clear there's an accident near

753
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,440
the house two in the morning police had

754
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,659
me pull the data from the camera

755
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,179
and I don't have one at home I just

756
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,620
don't

757
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,020
it was superb it wasn't like the bank

758
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,200
videos where it's all blurry it was

759
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,299
like movie quality

760
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,539
so you've got uh 4K video quality and

761
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,919
all you have to do is add someone to the

762
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,020
access control list but do you remember

763
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,820
to take them off because now they've got

764
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,159
someone new coming into your house they

765
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,720
can hear the conversations to and from

766
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,799
the porch

767
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,799
add that into the Alexa date model or

768
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,600
they can go back if they have access to

769
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,760
your Amazon account and they can go back

770
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,620
in here every conversation you've had

771
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,720
every Alexa hey Alexa sorry if I

772
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,340
triggered anything

773
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,740
you can also used to be a terrible CSI

774
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,260
cyber episode you know Swift on security

775
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,120
is making fun on Twitter way back in the

776
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,700
day but you can actually disable the

777
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,860
smoke alarm burglar alarm

778
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,320
so if the Hostile other person can have

779
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,539
access to disable this just through your

780
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,220
Amazon Alexa account

781
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,380
that's a bad thing

782
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,659
so you need to disable that change your

783
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,940
password same thing because as a fraud

784
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,799
examiner you have implied trust implied

785
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,020
approval that if even though you've

786
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,400
split and they still have access on

787
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,039
Alexa to on Amazon to your credit cards

788
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,059
and they rack it up

789
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,260
you've still left them there you didn't

790
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,700
remove them that means you're still

791
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,260
responsible for the your person's

792
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,240
responsible for it again changing that

793
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,760
just like off-boarding at work you have

794
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,140
to off-board someone from all of your

795
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,460
digital media

796
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,039
same for the printers so they're leaving

797
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,659
I would say take the printer with them

798
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,039
printers are relatively cheap and

799
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,720
there's a point to this

800
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
sorry

801
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,179
one of the classrooms over in Belgium

802
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,580
to demonstrate that the metadata that's

803
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,919
left behind we just walk over hit print

804
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,419
list and you can see the travel

805
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,880
itineraries of the soldiers is the

806
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,860
headers and you could go back and show

807
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,419
and piece together based on the travel

808
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,640
itinerary this group is going here that

809
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,440
group is going there just based on the

810
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,360
file names printed

811
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,820
so again there I was in a skiff for a

812
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,260
partner country

813
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,620
not I don't have access for National I

814
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,179
just walk over did the same thing and lo

815
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,580
and behold it prints every single

816
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,320
document

817
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
ever print on that print until it ran

818
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,760
out of paper I looked at that like I'm

819
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,140
not touching that I went and got the

820
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,120
warrant officer to look I was doing this

821
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,159
as part of the class there's all y'all's

822
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,200
classified data about 500 pages I'm not

823
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
touching it

824
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,059
and that was something they fixed but in

825
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,700
this world with the

826
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,799
potentially hostile abuser if they have

827
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,480
the ability to just reprint every file

828
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,279
as a feature of the printer that's

829
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,600
something that's also got to be

830
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,220
considered

831
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,260
on an Apple if you've left it behind if

832
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,419
they've left it behind you go a little

833
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,860
bit more you go into uh

834
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,120
oh you go to terminal far spool cups and

835
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,080
then

836
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,760
you get a list of every file ever

837
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,860
printed the ones that start with C you

838
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,299
get the metadata

839
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,820
the ones that start with D the ones is

840
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,220
ends in zero zero one that's an actual

841
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,419
PDF

842
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,640
so you can move copy that PDF to the

843
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,840
desktop and see the image of what's

844
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,159
printed

845
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,620
so this a simple strings command on that

846
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,659
in terminal you can see it that one

847
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,600
random one for this example it was a

848
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,059
World Market coupon printed off big deal

849
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,220
but you get the example that there's

850
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,840
your proof of concept if you want to see

851
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,039
everything ever done on that printer

852
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,020
that could be done on the Mac something

853
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,760
else to consider what you leave behind

854
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,840
or that person leave behind

855
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,159
this is a creepy one email mail and PDF

856
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,679
social media tracking

857
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,179
superhuman

858
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,360
it's a marketing tool I yeah

859
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,880
it's going to let you see every time the

860
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,520
user has opened the email where they

861
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,840
open the email in the geographic

862
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,520
location where they opened it that's the

863
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,080
service they offer for money

864
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,299
that's cool

865
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,279
so when you get the emails from vendors

866
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,500
that say Hey we've seen you open this

867
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,480
email four times are you interested in

868
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,220
our product that's what they're using

869
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,779
the way you block this is blocking the

870
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,080
tracking pixel through a VPN

871
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,059
Gmail is now also out of this so if

872
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,320
you're in sales

873
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,700
personally think it's a little bit

874
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,440
creepy

875
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,360
and even better now you've got PDF

876
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,039
tracking again for sales where they can

877
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,500
see what pages you open on the PDF how

878
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,360
long it's been open what pages you

879
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,039
skipped what you read and how long you

880
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,080
read it so you combine the two if you're

881
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,880
thinking of uh business acquisition

882
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,100
whether you're thinking

883
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,100
a contentious divorce child custody case

884
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,919
and you can know how long they took to

885
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,480
read that document

886
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,240
and when they opened it you're going to

887
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,340
have an Insight which again I believe is

888
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,020
Thoroughly unethical

889
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,360
there is an easy risk mitigation for

890
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,860
this

891
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,600
printed

892
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,580
done because if you print it they're not

893
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,260
going to be able to track you

894
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,779
we found one way to identify the beacon

895
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,399
haven't been able to identify this yet

896
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,919
on a Windows box

897
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,860
so open Terminal type in mdls metadata

898
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,659
list

899
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,880
drag and drop that hit enter and you're

900
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,559
going to see that B can pop out there

901
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,640
most

902
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,799
PDFs most files won't have that

903
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,080
extension pulling down the beacon to let

904
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,419
them know how long you've read it

905
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,460
and if this is a classroom or we had

906
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,299
more time I'd have you all open your Mac

907
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,100
mdls take something from iMessage and

908
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,720
view the file metadata

909
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,279
and then see where the file came from

910
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,960
who composed it how long it took them to

911
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,179
compose it whether it was phone number

912
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,220
whether it was email address and

913
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,140
actually see the metadata short story a

914
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,940
friend sent me a photo he said hey I'm

915
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,500
interested this girl keeps talking to me

916
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,600
online something doesn't feel right

917
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,240
same mdls and the photo is actually from

918
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,880
a model website he has been catfished he

919
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,700
cut contacts saved his time

920
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,860
but the example is still there whether

921
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,059
it's

922
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,500
flip side if you're sending that out

923
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,080
with your GPS enabled now the abuser can

924
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,880
see your new location for your house so

925
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,159
that's something you consider

926
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,200
we've actually got real packet

927
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,419
interception from man in the middle

928
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,899
anyone heard of this informed delivery

929
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,460
by the post office

930
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,120
anyone used it okay

931
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,980
no problem right

932
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,679
only two ways to know that if what you

933
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,720
get I won't get ahead of myself you get

934
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,779
a PDF for jpeg of the incoming mail

935
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,940
so if someone has signed you up for it

936
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,380
they can see if you have a check

937
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,539
something important coming they can take

938
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:49,980
that document out of the Sacramento

939
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,059
you've got the rest of the mail and a

940
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,380
Bed Bath and Beyond coupon that never

941
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,140
expires you've got that but you don't

942
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,580
know the key check from the government's

943
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,200
coming

944
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
the two steps I went to the Postmaster

945
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
General it's not that big of a deal I

946
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,059
went to the Postmaster General in Fort

947
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,100
Mill South Carolina I was in line of

948
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,419
just curious

949
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,520
the only two ways to identify this risk

950
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,020
is to ask in person in the post office

951
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,119
if it's been enabled for your account or

952
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,918
to try to sign up for it yourself and it

953
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,119
would tell you it's already been signed

954
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,879
up fantastic if your TDY PCS overseas

955
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:18,960
and want to know what's coming at home

956
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,300
how you're deployed but for the domestic

957
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,859
abuse this is another Vector where you

958
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,560
have true packet interception

959
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,779
another case where we've seen is

960
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,480
the I calendar if you forget to remove

961
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,040
someone from shared eye calendars you're

962
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,480
going to see what's going on as well as

963
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,219
for your travel schedule so that can

964
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,118
definitely disrupt you

965
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,280
the same for your social media account

966
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,800
you go to tnfolique.com and you can see

967
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,659
the person's using iPhone which would

968
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,159
give you the vector to say hey this is

969
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,960
iMessage click here to verify your

970
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,520
account

971
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,260
so something else to consider do you

972
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,460
really need to be on social media and

973
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,800
you're in a contentious event

974
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,780
you can spoof your GPS location I

975
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,980
actually was in the back of the

976
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,780
classroom at NATO I was posting from

977
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,640
Dara slum Mogadishu and Iran

978
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,740
that was just to show some things on

979
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,480
your recon are accurate some things

980
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,040
aren't so don't believe everything you

981
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,180
see online

982
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,780
uh the grug grugq says you signals use

983
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,000
tour I say assume everything is

984
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,420
compromised until you've reset it

985
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,520
from the new Star Wars series never

986
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,140
carry anything you don't control if

987
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,400
you've not got this locked down and

988
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,260
secure if you person thinks they're

989
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,579
being stalked

990
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,680
use personal meetings

991
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,900
just like old style Russia House

992
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,820
tradecraft bricks and sticks personal

993
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,380
meetings leave your electronics

994
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,880
somewhere routine secure if you go to

995
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,260
Planet Fitness leave your phone there

996
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,480
walk next door to the coffee shop have

997
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,920
your meeting with your family with your

998
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,720
attorney whoever it's going to Beacon

999
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
out that you're still at Planet Fitness

1000
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,200
when you're actually having a meeting

1001
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,700
you'll have the chance to arrange

1002
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,400
non-verbal paroles in my case it would

1003
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,140
be posting a picture of yourself wearing

1004
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,460
a rival teams

1005
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,619
shirt so if you ever saw me online with

1006
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,780
Georgia Bulldog shirt send Lawyers Guns

1007
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,880
and Money it's gone bad people would

1008
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,520
know I've never done that

1009
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,700
uh very quickly iPhone monitoring I'm

1010
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,140
the biggest one we've seen at safe

1011
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,820
Escape is mspy for if a has B's username

1012
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,280
and password they give to mspy here's a

1013
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,260
lot of ifs you have to sync up connected

1014
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,440
to Wi-Fi while powered in mspy connects

1015
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,839
your entire device to the cloud gives a

1016
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,099
report that's what you done that's not

1017
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,740
hacking that's just having your password

1018
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,839
the more malicious one is the Android

1019
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,000
where you can create a custom phishing

1020
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,960
link

1021
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,480
the target clicks on it and then mspy

1022
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,400
Begins hoovering the data down again

1023
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,339
change your password reset your device

1024
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:46,200
we've seen it working over at whatsapp

1025
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,359
where a fuzzy picture of puppies was

1026
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,940
sent the target clicks on the picture

1027
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,220
and it loads malware that's a more

1028
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,900
esoteric case but it is out there's a

1029
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,099
change your username change your

1030
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,780
password

1031
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,320
one thing for trapping your device

1032
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,540
program called Sleep Cycle put on your

1033
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,579
mattress and you can see how well you

1034
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,260
sleep that's cool

1035
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,780
but that would also tell you 4am my

1036
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,060
phone's been picked up and tampered with

1037
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,940
and put back down that's formed 95 I

1038
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,119
think for the pro but now Apple has

1039
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,339
your battery health is a cycle that

1040
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,900
cannot be reset unless you reset the

1041
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,500
whole phone so if at 2 am Snapchat

1042
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,780
Twitter and Facebook are open when

1043
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,820
you've been sound asleep that's going to

1044
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,200
let you know something's going on with

1045
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,540
your phone your person is compromised

1046
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,220
and you're not spending any money or

1047
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,240
millions of dollars on the government

1048
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,420
program for camper awareness same

1049
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,940
I just made that up

1050
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,160
oh it would be over here I'm sorry uh

1051
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,780
right there you can see the date and the

1052
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,859
time

1053
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:51,300
under battery 12 p.m 3 8 P.M 6 A.M

1054
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,460
and you'll see what apps are open at

1055
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,859
what time when you click on the time

1056
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,960
so if your mom wants to make sure you're

1057
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,760
not on Snapchat with your friends at

1058
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,420
three in the morning

1059
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,460
then that would work conversely that's

1060
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,440
everyone's looking at the 16 year old in

1061
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,119
the audience

1062
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,880
um but that's a way to know that your

1063
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,560
person's going through the phone thank

1064
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,220
you

1065
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,599
or

1066
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,160
someone's tampered your phone or you

1067
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,720
left you leave your bag in the hotel

1068
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,880
room while you're overseas and this

1069
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,260
would let you know your phone has been

1070
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,060
moved and tampered with while you're

1071
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,680
which might mean either the maid was

1072
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,000
curious or there's someone looking

1073
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,660
through stuff

1074
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,339
one trick we not trick

1075
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,920
on a Mac if you hit command R if you

1076
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,599
think your phone is a laptop is

1077
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,820
compromised command R it gives you a

1078
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,619
startup option to boot from a protected

1079
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,680
environment no key loggers no vpns no

1080
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,380
grammarly just the absolute value of a

1081
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,540
clean OS and then ironically you go to

1082
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,099
get help online where you can access

1083
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,079
email that people wouldn't have access

1084
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,880
to because of trackers on your phone or

1085
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,079
your excuse me on your laptop

1086
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,140
so someone comes to you and says they

1087
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,579
found a device they think they're being

1088
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,440
tracked we're getting more into the NSA

1089
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,040
the s p Total Access style tracking that

1090
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,540
civilians have access to now

1091
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,720
the fun thing is the devices that before

1092
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,300
took painful and hard cable coordination

1093
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,980
between the field and headquarters to

1094
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,320
get access to the device

1095
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,880
these are now things you can order off

1096
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,320
of Amazon

1097
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,680
so here's a power charger not my video

1098
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,060
put the SD card in

1099
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,200
plug it in put the faceplate back over

1100
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,980
it

1101
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
you've got audio video downside is

1102
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,300
someone's gonna have to watch the video

1103
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,240
process the take and listen to it

1104
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,280
and that's a lot of free time and no

1105
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,380
one's ever said oh they stalked me so I

1106
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,839
I went back to like

1107
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,420
doesn't gain you anything it's terrible

1108
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,000
as for a nanny cam possibly but in a

1109
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,119
domestic situation that's a hard no

1110
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,400
the limitations of electronic

1111
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,900
surveillance devices

1112
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,839
if you have continuous collection you're

1113
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,180
going to need AC power

1114
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,800
and if you have a continuous collection

1115
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,440
with AC power that means your storage is

1116
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,060
going to be either limited to the device

1117
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,560
which means someone has to physically

1118
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,119
come and collect it or it's going to

1119
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,740
connect to Wi-Fi going back to the

1120
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,540
router if we saw the beginning of the

1121
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,220
talk

1122
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,839
so if it's got limited collection

1123
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,280
limited power they're going to have a

1124
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,079
service it changes the batteries

1125
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,300
change the SD card

1126
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,119
again photos from Amazon

1127
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,240
this alarm clock is Wi-Fi enabled has a

1128
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,420
1080p camera and audio collection so if

1129
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,400
there's a string situation your person's

1130
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,020
come to you about and you see this is

1131
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,820
plugged in

1132
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,400
that's a pretty big clue there's a

1133
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,440
surveillance device

1134
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,940
I would leave the house call the police

1135
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,920
let them deal with because again that's

1136
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,780
a major felony that's not something you

1137
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,940
would want to deal with just point the

1138
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,920
police out let them deal with it

1139
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,520
the other devices are more

1140
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,560
the Amazon blink camera just to drop in

1141
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,119
the living room it's pretty obvious why

1142
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,680
it is but you could still change the

1143
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,000
housing make it a surveillance device

1144
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,980
that would still have to go back through

1145
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,780
Wi-Fi connection the device if you don't

1146
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,480
recognize on the router log there it is

1147
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,260
uh that is a

1148
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,320
128 gig USB drive you flip the switch up

1149
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,300
it's continual recording you flip it

1150
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,339
down it's burst recording only when it

1151
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:24,540
hears something the battery is good for

1152
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,460
about a week

1153
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,619
downside is processing the take does

1154
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,680
anybody want to sit through

1155
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,900
120 hours of audio

1156
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,180
No Hands no takers

1157
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,920
for one thing if it's

1158
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,740
a collection of a foreign adversary of

1159
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,839
you know troops are moving here here's

1160
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,640
our nuclear secrets that's one thing you

1161
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,660
may be able to run that through

1162
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,160
classified AI

1163
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,800
but the inflection given for a domestic

1164
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,839
case or that'll never happen versus oh

1165
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,460
that'll never happen

1166
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,500
AI is going to miss that so somebody had

1167
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,599
to physically process that

1168
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,579
so even though it's there you've got to

1169
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,260
think does the adversary have time to

1170
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,240
truly process the take

1171
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,260
that's a 720P

1172
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,599
camera built into an air freshener

1173
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,579
limitations are storage and Battery

1174
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,079
meaning someone's gonna have to come

1175
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,240
back into the residence and change those

1176
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,479
out

1177
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,900
anybody guess what's coming next

1178
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,400
what's that

1179
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,380
no not air tag no no

1180
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,060
yeah

1181
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,820
because when the kids go from parent Aid

1182
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,260
apparent B's house and they take their

1183
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,060
favorite teddy bear we had a where the

1184
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,160
teddy bears behind mom and the teddy

1185
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,720
bears shoulder surfing usernames and

1186
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,440
passwords because it has SD card camera

1187
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,900
and batteries which every teddy bear

1188
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,339
needs right now

1189
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,560
again that's again completely legal it's

1190
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,240
a nanny cam sure

1191
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,060
if you want to have it in the newborn's

1192
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,680
bedroom watching to make sure they're

1193
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,940
sleeping just get a regular camera

1194
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,319
they're babies you don't have to go

1195
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,819
through James Bond level just to watch

1196
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,560
your kids

1197
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,140
the next one is good for the right

1198
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,940
environment but it's terrible for

1199
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,220
collection as a domestic so something

1200
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,680
else to consider the Apple air pods

1201
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,900
paired with a hearing aid

1202
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,579
feature on your phone

1203
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,619
you can leave your phone in a room put

1204
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,599
the airpods in and then listen to the

1205
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,920
conversation around the phone even

1206
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,960
though you're upstairs

1207
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,940
completely unethical and I really don't

1208
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,020
want to know what someone's saying about

1209
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,880
me if I'm out of the room I'm just not

1210
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,140
emotionally strong enough to hear like

1211
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,700
the person I truly love is running me

1212
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,740
down I'm not good with that like

1213
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,599
yeah whatever my cooking's terrible but

1214
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,359
I will say it's good it's fine

1215
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,800
the same thing for the Bose headphones

1216
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,720
we had somebody reverse engineer these

1217
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,520
so they could actually serve as a

1218
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,960
microphone because you have the active

1219
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,300
listening microphone

1220
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,640
again esoteric case but the one person

1221
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,560
did that again dude if you're going that

1222
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,300
far to watch what your person's doing

1223
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,280
it's over move on

1224
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,440
pinders free hinges free I don't know

1225
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,079
what you kids date on if it if it's

1226
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,180
Clemson sheep Harmony I don't know but

1227
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,000
just like no that it's impressive but

1228
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,040
don't go that far same thing if you're

1229
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,319
on the phone you've got winterpod and

1230
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,359
someone else is listening the second

1231
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,940
earpod and you don't know what probably

1232
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,260
a little bit over the line something

1233
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,060
else to consider

1234
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,700
Amazon offers

1235
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,560
tracking devices it goes into Pelican

1236
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,420
little bitty Pelican case under the car

1237
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,880
looks like an old 2G antenna

1238
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,579
or you can track your spouse or person

1239
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,260
or whoever you have to have physical

1240
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,359
access to change the battery

1241
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,060
and this is what I lied that's not from

1242
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,420
a beacon that's a GP that's a image of

1243
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,520
an iPhone that I scraped the geolocation

1244
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,619
from

1245
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:43,260
a location I think it was Twitter

1246
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,780
but that's actually GPS stored from

1247
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,119
Twitter so your devices are always

1248
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,640
speaking if you have GPS enabled plus

1249
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,260
that's a cool KML file I just want to

1250
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,260
show off but you have to watch what your

1251
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,760
blue Force tracker these things will

1252
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,079
give away your data if you don't control

1253
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,760
it

1254
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,160
there is a Strava issue where classified

1255
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,960
locations overseas were beaconed out by

1256
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,119
Strava fitbits if you're concerned about

1257
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,440
your person's concerned about being

1258
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,420
stalked don't wear one

1259
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,040
problem solved easy

1260
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,660
like don't wear the beacon if you think

1261
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,760
you're being followed by your beacon

1262
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,280
all right right it's too much it's a

1263
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,819
nice thick Chicago deep dish pizza right

1264
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,400
no because face uh

1265
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,500
Domino's stores two years of your

1266
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,460
history

1267
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,079
of where you've ordered pizza delivered

1268
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,579
so if you get pizza every Thursday night

1269
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,440
you go to a new place to get away from

1270
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,900
the abuse of X and you don't change this

1271
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,760
password now your ex knows you get pizza

1272
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,280
every Tuesday night and you haven't

1273
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,540
cleared this you've just given your

1274
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,980
location away

1275
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,720
I wouldn't do that I go to the gym I'm a

1276
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,540
gym rat well Planet Fitness also tracks

1277
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,520
all of your logins so you've got to go

1278
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,260
for the low hanging fruit because if you

1279
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,119
don't change all of the passwords and

1280
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,319
the person's wondering how they're being

1281
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,720
tracked the Myriad of ways that it's out

1282
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,220
there that you're unaware of you've got

1283
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,200
to consider the whole picture

1284
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,720
because most stalker wear isn't Magic

1285
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,140
Agatha all along Apple Google Amazon

1286
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,880
telecommunications and Home Access got

1287
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,940
to change the usernames and passwords

1288
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,980
one of the issues transitioning from the

1289
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,300
control of the environment to identity

1290
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,819
theft we see this a lot identity

1291
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:16,500
theft.gov it's one of the few government

1292
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,359
websites it's actually

1293
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,180
well done well read and efficient

1294
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,520
the fraud triangle you have

1295
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,280
I'm going to divorce this person

1296
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,560
I've done so much for them they haven't

1297
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,960
given me my fair share I'm going to lose

1298
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,819
half my three quarters of my income I've

1299
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,680
got pressure rationalization opportunity

1300
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,720
I have access to all the documents

1301
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,940
and as a certified fraud examiner that's

1302
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,099
the triangle they teach us of the

1303
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:42,420
conditions or someone that's still

1304
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,680
Financial issues

1305
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,420
add in the spoof card app where if you

1306
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,060
know the SunTrust phone number is

1307
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,200
404-230-5555 it's going to show up on

1308
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,480
your phone as SunTrust you can spoof

1309
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,500
that call

1310
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,619
where it beacons out as SunTrust as

1311
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,480
Planet Fitness as Bank of America

1312
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,980
whoever

1313
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,540
and you've got the implied trust because

1314
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,460
it looks accurate

1315
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,800
your person has to be aware that this

1316
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,839
would be a vector of identity theft and

1317
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,480
they have to watch what they're saying

1318
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,579
so you go to Identity theft.gov click on

1319
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,680
the link start the case you get a case

1320
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,819
number if you go to the police they're

1321
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:19,140
going to send you here as well and that

1322
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,460
gives you a case number where you can

1323
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,560
start to stop start to stop is that

1324
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,740
right the fraud that's going on

1325
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,359
again it's either by either there's

1326
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,099
identity theft and fraud or there's not

1327
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,619
pretty simple to deal with if it is

1328
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,200
reported if it's not cool move on from

1329
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,920
there

1330
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,800
last bit data availability

1331
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,480
we would say in the CIA if it ain't in

1332
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,400
cable traffic it ain't but

1333
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,460
if it's not documented it doesn't happen

1334
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,140
when you're going through all of this

1335
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,760
and you're looking the files and helping

1336
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,980
this person get out from what's going on

1337
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,160
this is a from disk drill

1338
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,900
good luck remembering which file it's

1339
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,119
which you've got to document The Source

1340
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,960
trust me no don't want to do that again

1341
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,579
find an interesting file I'll go back to

1342
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,740
it and take notes when it's happening

1343
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,599
make copies share it out because you

1344
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,660
don't want to duplicate work

1345
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,420
create that timeline

1346
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,760
you've got to document things with

1347
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,980
authorities as they happen

1348
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,500
and the other is not to be all mushy but

1349
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,760
you've got to be available because if

1350
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,079
this person's come to you for help and

1351
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,040
they call and say hey I'm going through

1352
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,780
a rough time let's meet at your pie and

1353
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,119
get pizza tonight yeah it they're going

1354
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,619
through a lot you've got spare time why

1355
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,140
not be a decent person

1356
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,260
the old Pace plan for the data you found

1357
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,260
the screenshots everything else

1358
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,819
if you've got a primary copy an

1359
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:40,200
alternate copy

1360
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,940
the contingency copy and emergence so

1361
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,500
you've got the primary that might go on

1362
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,240
a safe deposit box

1363
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,880
the alternate copy and contingency might

1364
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,200
be the two you're working on and the

1365
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,880
emergency might be stored with your

1366
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,640
friends over in ugawagadu I don't know

1367
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,319
but that way you've got Geographic

1368
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:57,359
disbursement of this sole source of data

1369
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,400
that way when they have to go before the

1370
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,140
judge go before attorneys and say this

1371
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,180
is what's happened you've got redundant

1372
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,400
backups because you don't have AWS to

1373
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,220
build bill you for what's going on

1374
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,720
a couple of things is we're wrapping up

1375
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,339
here the end game for this

1376
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,260
as your person's escaping when we would

1377
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,619
close out a sensitive or a human asset

1378
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,599
and even though they might be fantastic

1379
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,240
they might be terrible you don't tell

1380
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,400
them that you don't build resentment

1381
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,839
it's hey you provide a lot of good

1382
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,520
information you've helped us achieve our

1383
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,740
gains that we had mutually together you

1384
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,240
wanted to help stop this regime's

1385
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,579
oppression of this group we've achieved

1386
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,579
that your data went to the present it

1387
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,200
but it went to the president he took

1388
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,940
action on it

1389
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,640
and you know here's we'll take that old

1390
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,740
laptop back let's copy your data out

1391
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,200
let's give you a new laptop and here's

1392
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,760
an extra bonus for your time thank you

1393
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,740
so much you've effectively terminated

1394
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,180
the relationship you've got your stuff

1395
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,040
back they've got cash they've got a new

1396
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,480
laptop their egos been stroked they're

1397
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,359
happy and this world

1398
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,819
it's I want my own cell phone plan I

1399
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,260
don't want them to know who I call I

1400
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,240
don't want them to know what's going on

1401
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,040
but if you say that it's an adversarial

1402
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,780
issues hey I've got a great new cell

1403
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,280
phone plan through work

1404
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,140
I've signed up for it I know money's

1405
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,760
tight right now

1406
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,260
and

1407
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,000
that's going to help save us some money

1408
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,400
it looks like you're doing a benefit but

1409
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,140
what you've actually done is taken your

1410
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,940
data off of their plan so they don't get

1411
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,380
the Insight the metadata for everything

1412
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,300
you're doing or they're doing

1413
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,819
same outcome versus I don't want you to

1414
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,440
see who I'm calling well that's a red

1415
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,119
flag versus

1416
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,260
being a little more persuasive about it

1417
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,180
so there's this movie called Star Wars

1418
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,119
it's about this domestic conflict

1419
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,140
um

1420
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,059
there's these two store there's these

1421
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,280
two Androids one of the strong

1422
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,720
encryption strong Authentication

1423
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,099
and the other had weak encryption and

1424
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:57,839
was white if the data had just been

1425
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,160
deleted

1426
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,140
you run disk reel you're an undulation

1427
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,800
oh wow Anakin's actually gone bad Star

1428
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,240
Wars is over in about 20 minutes the

1429
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,640
right uh forensic technician right

1430
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,619
same thing to keep in mind unless you're

1431
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,079
sure that it's truly locked down maybe

1432
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:15,059
get a new device maybe get a new USB

1433
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:17,099
drive maybe get a new laptop just to

1434
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,660
make sure

1435
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,859
Bring It Forward a little bit

1436
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:23,220
unauthorized devices on a network I hate

1437
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,300
to say it that's a good movie about

1438
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,740
dating it

1439
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,260
when Thanos saw that nebula showed up he

1440
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,420
had a unauthorized device on his Network

1441
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,700
he performed live memory forensics did

1442
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,740
an extraction of her memory

1443
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,900
did a takeout analysis of her location

1444
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,720
chat and images to find out what the

1445
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,460
opposition was doing which is pretty

1446
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,559
fantastic for literally blue team

1447
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,960
operator working kind of with the sock

1448
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,240
Maybe

1449
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,180
but that remains conversely The Avengers

1450
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,680
didn't know that one of their devices

1451
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,480
had fallen in the adversary's hands and

1452
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,680
everything that they thought was

1453
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,599
confidential and secure had been leaked

1454
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,700
out so you want to make sure your device

1455
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,220
is not being cloned to somewhere else

1456
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,140
couple of things we've had to remind

1457
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,660
Folks at safe Escape nobody has

1458
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,059
unlimited resources today's October 1st

1459
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,200
start of the fiscal year for the

1460
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,420
government anybody who yesterday was

1461
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,740
scrambling because they're out of budget

1462
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,359
now is a flush new budget for the next

1463
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,619
12 months

1464
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,680
regardless unless you're the FED Reserve

1465
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,119
but most people don't have an Elizabeth

1466
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,180
of resources Occam's razor anybody want

1467
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,779
to guess for that

1468
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,420
all right simplest answer is the best

1469
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,059
and who will process the collection

1470
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,280
just because someone says it's possible

1471
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,720
oh they're listening to all my phone

1472
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,420
calls all the time how let's talk about

1473
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,400
it let's get to the why do you think

1474
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,480
that's happening

1475
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,940
because oh there everyone's following

1476
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,140
okay

1477
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,760
whereas gang's talking may be a thing

1478
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,680
having a full-blown surveillance team

1479
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,680
watching you 24 7 365 is an amazing

1480
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,920
amount of resources in gasoline

1481
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,140
I drive a Jeep gas is not cheap and I'm

1482
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,540
not going to just drive around 24 7 to

1483
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,760
follow somebody for why for no money

1484
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,079
what that's not going to happen

1485
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,960
so the short version of all this of 102

1486
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,300
slides change your passwords if your

1487
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,920
person thinks something's going on on a

1488
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,020
clean machine change the password change

1489
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,280
your locks

1490
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,500
report the events as they happen to law

1491
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,839
enforcement document everything

1492
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,400
because if you don't document it it

1493
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,839
didn't happen

1494
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,359

1496
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,300
different domains if you're looking for

1497
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,099
work rather than having AOL Gmail or

1498
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,619

1502
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,099
if it's probably not hacking it's

1503
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,020
probably Agatha all along it's probably

1504

Amazon Google Facebook it's probably

1505
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
access to one of those

1506
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,020

1515
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,640

1516
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,900
when you're talking about leaving

1517
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,760

1518

1522
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,740

1528

Faraday bag one will drain your battery

1529
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,900
two then you're going to disappear from

1530
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,579
the network so you've got a gray spot

1531
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:01,740
where you're not truly there

1532
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,599
so pick your poison do you want to

1533
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,200
either trust the device is going to be

1534
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,099
secure or leave it somewhere in pattern

1535
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,660
say if you work at one of the secure

1536
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,800
sites

1537
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,140
you leave it in a locker or whatever

1538
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,000
people might do there

1539
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,619
and take your car drive somewhere else

1540
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:23,420
so pick your poison but
