1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,080
is

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,299
a red hat principle architect

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,130
thank you

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,300
[Applause]

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,760
all right we'll go ahead and make sure

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,820
this works go ahead and get started if I

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,740
can

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,559
get this going right

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,399
there we go uh so I'm going to give you

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,700
a short link where you can download the

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,760
PDF you can see everything on the slides

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
and and one of the reasons I want to

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,620
share that short link

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,539
there will be some graphics that come up

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,180
and I'm going to ask a question at the

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,020
end of what is zero trust and you can

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,620
rent when a hacking kubernetes threat

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,199
analysis book so if you're familiar with

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,720
container platforms familiar with

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,500
kubernetes this is a hacking kubernetes

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,400
book

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,240
and so when I get to that link

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,939
you can pull it up on your phone or

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,180
laptop and when I ask the question you

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,759
should have the answer

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,180
and I the other

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,900
prizes are the network switch right

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,420
Wi-Fi adapter and

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,080
lock pick

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,340
so this was the abstract that was put up

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,500
and so I wanted to make sure it was in

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,280
the PDF because there's a couple of

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,280
read ahead links and I'll be walking

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,560
around some just for a minute and then

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,040
I'll have to sit I had knee surgery so

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,640
um

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,240
I don't have meds now because it's been

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,960
about four weeks so I may be walking

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,079
around and sitting so excuse me if if

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm around too much but the agenda today

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,160
I'll talk about the topics we'll go into

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,860
zero trust service mesh I'm going to

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,099
talk about red hat openshift

44
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,660
and service mesh but keep in mind the

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,140
service mesh and based on istio and

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,220
kubernetes those are vendor agnostic so

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,220
everything that I go over you should be

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,760
able to install on your own and try

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
service mesh and try some of the

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,319
references that I'll give you

51
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,180
for the workshop and I'll show you how

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,060
to do that so hopefully you're able to

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,959
use that Public Presentation link I have

54
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:58,739
there

55
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,900
and pull it up and uh when you see me

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,120
get to the disa reference architecture

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,120
diagram that's the one that you want to

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,220
pay close attention to when I ask the

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,540
question for the book giveaway

60
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,980
so

61
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,379
um I'll have to get used to to looking

62
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,940
down there instead of looking up at the

63
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,099
screen or my laptop so I am a principal

64
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,500
architect for Red Hat I've been with

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
them I actually left and went back total

66
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,000
of 10 years and I focus on Department of

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
Defense projects but security related

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,500
initiatives I spend a couple of days a

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,400
week doing internal Red Hat initiatives

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,040
and billable to the Department of

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,060
Defense and I went to University of

72
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,040
South Carolina and University of Phoenix

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,640
for bachelor's and Master's in computer

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,700
science and working on my Doctorate of

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,799
engineering now at Colorado State

76
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,099
University so the online programs that a

77
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,000
lot of the universities are getting

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,640
a lot better and helpful for those that

79
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,859
are still work

80
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,660
and one of the things that I would like

81
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,820
to say if anybody in here is still in

82
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,800
the service or planning on going into

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,460
the service I wanted to thank you for uh

84
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,720
your service and any of the dod agencies

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,740
I spend uh have spent a good bit of time

86
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,800
on different DOD agencies but Army and

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,780
at Fort Gordon I've spent a good bit of

88
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,580
time lately

89
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,759
so what we're going to cover today uh

90
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,300
the first topic will be zero trust

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,199
and we could spend a lot of time on each

92
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,040
of these topics but we will hit some

93
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Concepts on zero trust then we'll hit

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,100
some Concepts on service mesh

95
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,759
and some examples of service mesh and

96
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,000
then we will talk about

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
specific implementation example around

98
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Red Hat open shift and red hat service

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,060
mesh

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,840
so what is zero trust

101
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,199
uh there are a couple of things I want

102
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,639
to uh note on what is zero trust and

103
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,699
that is it is a security framework

104
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,539
when you talk to folks who say they have

105
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,360
a solution for zero trust or a product

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,880
the solution you can get toward the zero

107
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,180
trust framework but getting a specific

108
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,639
product that covers everything in the

109
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,699
framework that is more difficult and

110
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,780
we'll go through some of that but the

111
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,639
main Concepts around zero trust are

112
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,699
getting away from Castle and moat and

113
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,520
making

114
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,340
the perimeter more important than

115
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,900
assuming there's a breach or a possible

116
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,199
issue internally so when we go through

117
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,039
some of the other references we always

118
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,419
want to make sure from end to end

119
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,400
that there's encryption that you have

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,639
multi-factor authentication that you're

121
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,979
looking at least privilege and that's

122
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,319
all the way through Network and up the

123
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,840
stack

124
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,199
now we can't look at Perimeter and say

125
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,759
that

126
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,419
um

127
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,919
we have a firewall or we have

128
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,919
disconnected Ops we have to assume that

129
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,639
there is a breach inside the network at

130
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
all times and we also need to be able to

131
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,039
analyze

132
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,819
within anything going on on the network

133
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,280
so now we want to make sure that with no

134
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,400
traditional Network Edge and we're going

135
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,160
into more iot there are more Edge

136
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,940
devices that we're looking at dads which

137
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,080
is the data assets applications and

138
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,440
services

139
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,639
so a couple of things on the timeline

140
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,139
for zero zero trust is not new uh people

141
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,319
have been talking about uh the

142
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
parameters perimeterization

143
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,340
removing castle and moat

144
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,220
concentrating on encryption and identity

145
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,880
for a long time and you'll notice this

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,180
timeline talks about in 2004

147
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,919
when there was a Jericho forum

148
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,060
that talked about the parameterization

149
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,819
and then went on to Forester which is an

150
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,699
industry analyst talking more about

151
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,400
their thoughts on

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,460
um zero trust and then going into

153
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,120
Gartner with their Carta

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,379
and Google with a Beyond core and

155
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,500
Foresters was ztx so you have all these

156
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,159
different concepts previously from

157
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,599
different industry analysts and

158
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,219
organizations but why is it important

159
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,140
today

160
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,039
if we go over to

161
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,779
2019 into 2021 2022 there's the nist

162
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,660
special publication that defines core

163
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,420
components of zero trust deployment

164
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,140
models and then the executive order from

165
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,899
President Biden came out that there are

166
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,720
certain things that you you have to do

167
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,540
certain actions that the agencies have

168
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,760
to adhere to

169
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,800
and I think in that executive order it

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,980
mentions zero trust like 14 times

171
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,380
something of that nature but the key is

172
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,140
the modernization and moving to the

173
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,000
cloud and then the 2022

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,580
memorandum from OMB is not on this

175
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,700
timeline that was uh earlier this year

176
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,120
but it talks about specific actions that

177
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,680
are required within the different

178
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,339
pillars by the end of 2024 so what

179
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,220
this talk focuses on a service mesh and

180
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,459
some zero trust aspects but there are

181
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,019
specific mandates for DOD agencies and

182
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,320
across the government to complete

183
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,220
certain tasks within certain time frames

184
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,540
so I'm not going to read all these but I

185
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,120
did want to include it in the PDF so you

186
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,019
can reference them it's the executive

187
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,760
order that I mentioned from President

188
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
Biden I put the OMB memorandum in there

189
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,019
because in the appendix it lists all the

190
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,060
uh actions that are required with the

191
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,920
different pillars and specific time

192
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,019
frames

193
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,060
and you can find different documentation

194
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,760
from nist NSA sysa so forth and get more

195
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,800
of an understanding of the different

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,100
aspects from

197
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,980
what you need to to build in your

198
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,640
Enterprise for zero trust I went ahead

199
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,640
and put some links to some of the global

200
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,640
agencies because it's not just the US

201
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,660
that has said oh now I need to make sure

202
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,180
everything internally

203
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,380
is just a secure coming into my network

204
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,220
now I have to make sure I am assuming

205
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,720
that there is a breach internally that I

206
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,800
always uh verify and I never trust so

207
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,220
now it's more about granularity and

208
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,399
making sure that you're validating on

209
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
every transaction

210
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,680
especially in microservices which is

211
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,540
what we're talking about with service

212
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,160
mesh

213
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
so some of the core components and

214
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,420
principles that are in the niss special

215
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,140
publication

216
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,300
and this diagrams

217
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,839
so you'll see this throughout the talk

218
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,180
and the different diagrams where we have

219
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,380
the control plane that manages

220
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,720
configuration

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,459
and

222
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,800
for the proxies and then you'll notice

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,260
the policy enforcement points which are

224
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,160
the proxies for the the microservices

225
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
that we're going to talk about but the

226
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,399
important thing to to note on this

227
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,920
diagram is I'm splitting Network traffic

228
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,500
on the uh

229
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,899
to the policy enforcement point that is

230
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,940
what is going to enable access

231
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,060
to the Enterprise resources

232
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,079
so as this says the important thing is

233
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,220
the all the data sources

234
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,320
and all communication is secured on the

235
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,820
network and everything is considered a

236
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,100
um a resource and then when we look at

237
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,339
the core components we also we have the

238
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,139
enforcement Point you're going to see in

239
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,079
service mesh you're going to see the

240
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,139
decision point and

241
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,899
those should be thought about in

242
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,660
everything not just service mesh where

243
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,360
am I enforcing

244
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,180
policies and where am I building the

245
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,800
policies and making them available

246
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,260
to make a decision for the enforcement

247
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,480
point

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,760
so if you'll notice this this is what I

249
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,040
was mentioning a minute ago that this is

250
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,500
zero trust reference architecture

251
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,959
so if if you can take a note of this

252
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,820
diagram that's what we're going to talk

253
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,300
about on the book giveaway in a minute

254
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,040
but you'll notice that there are seven

255
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,740
main pillars

256
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,339
five of which are the user device

257
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,579
Network application and data but you'll

258
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,279
notice over on the right hand side there

259
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,980
are different color for Automation and

260
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,639
visibility some of these go across a

261
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,820
couple of pillars and some go across all

262
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,180
and the key here is looking at this

263
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,899
diagram it is a security model right and

264
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,680
it is holistic security it's not I take

265
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,560
authentication for a user and I'm done

266
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,339
it is a maturity model that you have to

267
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,700
think about for customers to go from a

268
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,380
basic to Advanced or basic to an optimal

269
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,620
maturity a model on capabilities that

270
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,380
are deployed

271
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,540
so one of the things that I like with

272
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,600
this

273
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,959
graphic at home with the systems the

274
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,300
multi-factor authentication while my son

275
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,760
asked me something said well we need to

276
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,100
do the multi-factor go ask your mom too

277
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,740
and my wife just looks at me like I'm a

278
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,199
nerd so I like that picture a lot so as

279
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,480
I talked about there's a zero trust

280
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,260
maturity model that sisa put out and

281
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,279
this helps identify the traditional down

282
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,760
to the optimal so not just service mesh

283
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,899
that we're going to be talking about

284
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,500
here in a minute but the different

285
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,620
pillars and what you should look for in

286
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,779
traditional Advanced optimal

287
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,800
I I look at this like devsecops and your

288
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,839
pipelines that you're building you're

289
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,320
never going to be finished if somebody

290
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,680
says I'm done I put a product in for

291
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,360
zero trust it's not accurate because

292
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,540
it's a complex solution with many

293
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,180
capabilities that have to be installed

294
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,240
and one of the things that you note here

295
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,000
would transition to zero trust is

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,620
identifying the actors the assets

297
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,820
looking at policies and you'll notice

298
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,560
identify candidate Solutions so what

299
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,600
technology isn't products should I be

300
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,360
using so that I can get to deployment

301
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,279
and monitoring which is the very last

302
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,480
thing

303
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,959
and this is just another view another

304
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,160
input on a maturity model that's in the

305
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,699
just a reference architecture the other

306
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,920
one

307
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,899
was oops

308
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,060
this one's sisa

309
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,339
this one has traditional Advanced

310
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,360
optimal

311
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,279
this one in the disa reference

312
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,980
architecture has Baseline intermediate

313
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,320
Advanced but you'll notice they're

314
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,399
similar and what they're looking for but

315
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,259
what I like in this one is the

316
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,839
discussion on Discovery and assessment

317
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,820
so if I were to go into a project for

318
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,920
DOD I would want to ask these questions

319
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,759
and ask you know how can I apply all

320
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,160
those Concepts on the project and look

321
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,980
at a higher level program what is the

322
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,179
program doing for zero trust and with

323
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,480
this

324
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,919
these are red hat products when you look

325
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,740
at open shift you look at Advanced

326
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,140
cluster security

327
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,600
IDM staff and so forth

328
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,280
I like to be vendor agnostic even though

329
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,119
I work for Red Hat I like to talk about

330
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,240
open source Technologies so the key is

331
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,580
not a red hat product although I know

332
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,740
everyone in here loves red hat and wants

333
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,980
Red Hat products the key is looking at

334
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,360
the capabilities and how am I fulfilling

335
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,059
that need or requirement

336
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,080
so I don't want to go too deep into this

337
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,100
but there are

338
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,919
the old layer three rules that a lot of

339
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,120
folks use and some of the firewall

340
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,260
companies are putting out next

341
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,100
generation and this is an example of a

342
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,480
Kipling method that Palo Alto uses and

343
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,960
you'll notice it goes not just Source

344
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,200
destination Port protocol but it goes

345
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,600
from who what when so forth across and

346
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,620
the middle one is around the Enterprise

347
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,440
guide which is a book but it goes into

348
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,059
the subject the target the action the

349
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,200
condition

350
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,840
and then on the right it goes into the

351
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,220
zachmore standard which is fine grained

352
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,679
authorization so the key here that I

353
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,160
wanted to show is that

354
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,940
um

355
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,840
we want the fine-grained

356
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,299
authorization we want to know more uh

357
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,840
than just a couple of specifics about

358
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,720
who's accessing a resource we want to

359
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,840
get down into the granularity

360
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,299
all right so we're going to go ahead and

361
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,720
give away the book so please just trace

362
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,799
your hand

363
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,740
who can give me the capabilities how

364
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,980
many and the exact ones that are in the

365
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,559
data pillar up somebody has their end up

366
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,980
back there

367
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,980
okay so look at this closely

368
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,179
this is not the pillars but the

369
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,400
capabilities in the data pillar

370
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,380
there's

371
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,360
so who sees something else

372
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,320
so does anyone see that

373
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,860
some go across pillars go ahead

374
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,799
correct I hate to ask you but I can't

375
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,679
walk that out there so everybody had

376
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,679
good answers but machine learning is

377
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
part of the data as well and that's

378
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
where I was trying to go that's why I

379
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,480
put spans two or less pillars to give a

380
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,179
hint there that there's actually the

381
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,280
machine learning that's included as well

382
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,080
so good

383
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,840
but I'm glad everybody was able to pull

384
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,600
that up so let's start going into

385
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,039
service mesh

386
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,260
so

387
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,580
um

388
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,539
this concept or service mesh and within

389
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,080
openshift the off service mesh operator

390
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
is based on istio and that's one of the

391
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,299
more popular

392
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,140
um

393
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,380
service meshes and we'll see additional

394
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,860
examples the VMware AWS so forth not

395
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,520
just red hat but just as we talked about

396
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,580
with the nist special publication

397
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,280
there's a control plane there's a data

398
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,600
plane East-West traffic right

399
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,740
and we have a sidecar that protects each

400
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,360
micro service

401
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,820
so why do we want to do that we want to

402
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,760
control Network traffic and control the

403
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,539
health

404
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:48,260
we want to separate that from within the

405
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,419
any additional logic within the

406
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,059
microservice we also want to be able to

407
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,980
observe and Trace

408
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,039
so that's a lot of the benefits of the

409
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,299
service mesh

410
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,640
so these two examples the one on the

411
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,539
left is AWS and you'll notice that they

412
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,940
have the concept of envoy as well

413
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,760
there are multiple components that work

414
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,299
within a service mesh

415
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,080
for that Network control and the

416
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,380
segmentation away from the microservice

417
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,400
itself and then the right is tanzu so

418
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,840
all these are around the kubernetes

419
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,439
container platform

420
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,280
okay

421
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,940
so when we look at the service mesh data

422
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,140
plane

423
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,620
we're looking at

424
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,200
as I mentioned the sidecar controlling

425
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
the

426
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,140
the networking and isolating those

427
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,480
to the sidecar instead of being

428
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,059
controlled by some other method and so

429
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,640
what does that give us one of the things

430
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,700
that the OMB

431
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,620
memorandum

432
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,059
indicated has to be done before physical

433
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,780
year 2024 as end-to-end encryption so

434
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,020
mtls

435
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,020
multi-factor Authentication

436
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,580
what the service mesh helps with is some

437
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,659
of that security with mtls and service

438
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:34,820
to service

439
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,280
with

440
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,400
certificates so I know what service say

441
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,640
and service B are and that they are

442
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,280
authorized and can authenticate between

443
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,600
Services also the observability circuit

444
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,460
breaking load balance Etc so the data

445
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,340
plane focuses on the network portion

446
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,559
then when we look at the control plane

447
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,679
as I mentioned

448
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,419
this doesn't look at the data packets

449
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:12,720
but this does make sure that policies

450
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,900
and configurations are updated in the

451
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,960
proxies as needed on the data plane

452
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,460
all right so as I mentioned istio is one

453
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,039
of the popular service meshes and we

454
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,080
have our service A and B with our

455
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,740
sidecar or our proxy and we have the

456
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,220
control plane with istio and it has some

457
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,059
components that control

458
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:42,679
Discovery

459
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,620
certificate management and so forth so

460
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,280
that has been accepted even though it

461
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,840
started a while back I can't remember

462
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,600
the exact year but it was a started a

463
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,720
while back and the cloud native

464
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,440
Foundation recently in the cloud native

465
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,260
Foundation even though it's been around

466
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,000
a little bit

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,460
uh what I wanted to show on the right

468
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,580
hand side and we won't dive deeply into

469
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,000
this because a lot of folks are still

470
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,900
focused on sidecar or proxy but when you

471
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,299
look on the right hand side there's

472
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,480
something called ambient mesh an ambient

473
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,860
mesh just came out recently and istio

474
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,539
there was at least one guy that used to

475
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,020
work at red hat that went to solo.io

476
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,620
and within that ambient mesh they are

477
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,340
trying to give the ability instead of

478
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,220
using a sidecar

479
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:50,640
to have a z tunnel so it's a mixture of

480
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,299
being able to use layer seven and and

481
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,140
layer four within this model and so I

482
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,120
have the links there that you can look

483
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,840
at in the future so as we talked about

484
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,919
with service mesh I have advantages and

485
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,600
disadvantages

486
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,460
I feel like there should be music or

487
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,080
something because it's so quiet in here

488
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,900
um so with some of the advantages and

489
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,539
disadvantages we talked about

490
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,020
the security observability that's a big

491
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,059
one the

492
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,799
um reliability is another and product

493
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,200
productivity and efficiency and I don't

494
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,380
know if everybody remembers the pizza as

495
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,020
a service diagram that went all over

496
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,860
LinkedIn and so forth but now with

497
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,940
service mesh Cloud native

498
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,659
or service serviceless on that far right

499
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,380
hand diagram you'll see service mesh in

500
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,320
there and I need to change that pizza as

501
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,080
a service to show that

502
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,880
um and I don't remember who originally

503
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,600
did that but a disadvantage is some of

504
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,720
the possible delayed communication now

505
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,740
we have the proxies in front of the

506
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,520
microservices that are intercepting and

507
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,080
deciding what should go to the

508
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,140
microservices so depending on Hardware

509
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,320
depending on configuration that can be a

510
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,399
delayed communication

511
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,620
so

512
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,720
again this is the this is a different

513
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,299
link but it's ambient security and what

514
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,240
they're trying to do they're not trying

515
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,059
to completely get rid of sidecars but

516
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,659
they're trying to build this ambient

517
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,320
service mesh in istio so we have the pp

518
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,320
with layer 7 and the security

519
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,799
secure overlay and

520
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,080
to me when I look at this the biggest

521
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,740
thing or two big things in here one is

522
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,080
the separation of the application from

523
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
the data plane which we talked about the

524
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,000
proxy and application being in a data

525
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,059
plane but also avoiding the

526
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,480
multi-tenancy that may happen

527
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,159
with your proxies

528
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,340
so it's a good read to see what's going

529
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,200
on in the future and I don't know when

530
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,620
that will get into

531
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,659
the service mesh operator for openshift

532
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,440
or the other vendors so just to I like

533
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,679
this image too with

534
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,320
our service person protecting us the

535
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,559
zero trust model but the three things to

536
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,380
note here as I was talking about a

537
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,020
minute ago was the certificate

538
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,700
management between services

539
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,559
and

540
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,500
the mtls so those three really apply to

541
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,039
authentication authorization of services

542
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,380
communication between them and the

543
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,980
mutual TLS

544
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:12,600
so that's the two-way encryption

545
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:19,620
so I threw this out here just to uh

546
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,080
everyone I assume knows IBM bought red

547
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,080
hat and red hat is still continuing its

548
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,080
open source and open shift is one of

549
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,960
their big products

550
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
that we work on different Cloud

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,559
providers and different verticals but

552
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,360
what I wanted to note here when we get

553
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,020
into openshift and service mesh

554
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,539
the service mesh we're talking about

555
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,940
istio traffic control kiali which is

556
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,520
some of the traffic visualization and

557
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,340
Jaeger which is that tracing and I'm

558
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,640
going to show that just briefly and give

559
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,940
you links that you can try this in your

560
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,100
own environment but some of the use

561
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,159
cases are listed here that you can go

562
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,799
back and look at

563
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,840
but the Z zero trust aspects

564
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,340
you can see that in the different use

565
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,120
cases for service mesh and I know this

566
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,880
is going to hopefully this won't confuse

567
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,340
everybody give me just a second so when

568
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,779
we go back to uh technology focus and

569
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,320
how we can do segmentation and other

570
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,080
things

571
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,140
you can see that

572
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,419
service mesh can fall into this capab

573
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,399
different capabilities but it wouldn't

574
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,919
solve everything that you need to solve

575
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,760
for service mesh I mean zero trust

576
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,820
all right so where was I

577
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,620
so you'll notice looking at this diagram

578
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,600
and looking at

579
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,140
um

580
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,600
how we've overlaid the

581
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,520
ZTA core components that are in the

582
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,919
reference architecture from disa

583
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,620
I'm sorry from nist the nist special

584
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,620
publication as core components

585
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,779
this has our data plane

586
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:26,179
with the proxy

587
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:31,260
and we have our control plane that has

588
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,220
istio and it has the different

589
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,919
components of istio for Discovery

590
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,100
configuration and certificate management

591
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,980
and of course we consider the proxy as

592
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,159
the enforcement point we consider the

593
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,419
control plane and istio Demon as the

594
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,659
decision point

595
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:57,659
and you can refer back to uh some of

596
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,539
what I was talking about with the right

597
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,820
hand side there for some of the bullet

598
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,178
points

599
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,299
so I wanted to throw this in as well and

600
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,820
talk about API gateways

601
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,600
so I make the assumption that if you've

602
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,200
worked in microservices you've started

603
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,279
working in API gateways as well so North

604
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,880
South traffic coming in through an API

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,960
Gateway Red Hat has three scale which is

606
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
one of their products and when we look

607
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,700
at service mesh we're going to see an

608
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,179
sdo Ingress

609
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:41,520
Gateway for monitoring security policies

610
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,100
so forth

611
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,500
but in the demo links that I'm going to

612
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,159
give you and show you just briefly

613
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,520
the three scale so API Gateway and

614
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,000
service mesh can work together on North

615
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,700
southbound traffic and then our service

616
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,120
mesh really does a lot with the

617
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,500
East-West traffic right between

618
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,020
services and the proxies and the traffic

619
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,840
and routing and so forth so as you see

620
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,360
on the left hand side it's traffic into

621
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,620
open shift within services and then

622
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,580
egress or external which is on this

623
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,960
diagram as well

624
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,860
so I wanted to show in this diagram on

625
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,080
the left hand side if we didn't have

626
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,179
service mesh and I wanted to control

627
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,299
routing I wanted to control certificates

628
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,120
I wanted to control what's going into my

629
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,519
microservices like a front end and

630
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,399
back-end what would I have to do I would

631
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:51,120
have to do a lot of hard coding to make

632
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,399
sure what's going on if I was going to

633
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,580
adhere to zero trust on the right hand

634
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,159
side you can see with service mesh now

635
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,120
I'm protecting my microservices and I

636
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,679
can do a little more with network

637
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,460
policies certificate management

638
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,219
so forth segmentation

639
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,940
and the router the traffic goes into the

640
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,719
control plane and then goes through the

641
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,179
proxies

642
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,480
so I'm gonna hop over to the commute

643
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,879
computer here in just a second and do a

644
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,280
brief demo just to show you where you

645
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,859
can grab some links to do a deployment

646
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,780
on your own and have a similar

647
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,520
environment

648
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,280
um and but just talk about a couple of

649
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,540
these slides real quick if you go to

650
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,099
cloud.redhat.com

651
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:45,659
one of the things that I've liked

652
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,719
recently that they've made available I

653
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,060
can do it in assisted installer for a

654
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,580
single node openshift if I have enough

655
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,420
resources in a VM or a single piece of

656
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,940
Hardware I can go there and give it

657
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,820
some specific settings configuration it

658
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,240
will build a ISO you put that on a USB

659
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,300
drive stick it into your hardware and

660
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,760
it'll create a single node openshift

661
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,760
which is the Enterprise kubernetes so I

662
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,099
can have a complainer container platform

663
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,359
built pretty easily just by going to

664
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,700
cloud.redhat.com

665
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,220
and then

666
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,440
on the bottom right that should be

667
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,460
showing the cluster that I created at

668
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,420
home

669
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,280
and what I'm working on now is the demo

670
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm going to show you is in something

671
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,260
called demo.redat.com so it's a cloud

672
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,339
demo system that you can show Red Hat

673
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,820
products and it has different demos

674
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,619
but you have to have certain access to

675
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,400
it

676
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,339
so on this hybrid Cloud patterns if

677
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:00,480
you're interested in different

678
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,020
architecture like software supply chain

679
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,280
so one of the other zero trust Concepts

680
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,220
that have come out as secure supply

681
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,680
chain

682
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,099
the software bill of materials and so

683
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,260
with this hybrid Cloud patterns I'm

684
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,240
trying to get a zero trust pattern in

685
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,420
there as well to have advanced cluster

686
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,359
security to have

687
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,220
service mesh to have some sample

688
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,700
applications so you can easily go in and

689
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
uh

690
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,060
deploy not just

691
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,560
openshift this assumes that your

692
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,440
cluster's already there but it can

693
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,040
install specific operators like service

694
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,260
mesh and do some setup with some

695
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,740
applications so I can just go look at

696
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,700
the concepts and do some testing on my

697
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,040
own use the book that we gave away and

698
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,940
try and hack kubernetes or openshift so

699
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,260
that's currently in progress but why is

700
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,180
available that I think is a good

701
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,700
reference

702
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,660
the demo itself on

703
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,579
demo.redhat.com you have to have certain

704
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:21,780
access but these three links there's a

705
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,520
demo walkthrough

706
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,880
the install from scratch allows you to

707
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
install the different components and in

708
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640
this case it's single sign-on service

709
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,160
mesh and three scale

710
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,859
and there's an e-book that goes into

711
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,760
deep depth on

712
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,320
the service mesh versus API management

713
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,540
or how they complement each other so

714
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,440
those are three really good references

715
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,119
and you'll notice on the top

716
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,640
left

717
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,160
that diagram talks about service mesh

718
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,640
but in that demo it goes into API

719
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,460
management single sign up more so that's

720
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,700
just the initial diagram and then on the

721
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,859
right that's chiali for some

722
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,680
visualization and I'll show you some of

723
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,560
that here in just a second

724
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,599
so let me walk or hobble over to my

725
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,060
computer

726
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,060
and

727
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,140
when we look at this walkthrough

728
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,240
so it shows the different components or

729
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,140
demo assets

730
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,020
and we're going to

731
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,560
go into the instance I created

732
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,900
So within openshift you can see

733
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,320
different routes

734
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,339
and this is a Cali route that I

735
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,299
mentioned a minute ago

736
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,460
um going in there if we go back to here

737
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,880
and go to the one above

738
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,839
the second link if you have a kubernetes

739
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,339
instance

740
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,099
you can really go into the install from

741
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,740
scratch although it describes deploying

742
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,760
to openshift you could install

743
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,640
these istio and these other pieces key

744
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,560
cloak so forth on kubernetes but in this

745
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,599
case since we love red hat we're going

746
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,280
to go in here and look real quick

747
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,399
uh let's see

748
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,099
and I know everybody and the video is

749
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,140
seeing this but this cluster is going to

750
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,700
go away anyway so that's okay

751
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,920
so don't do that at home that's not very

752
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,480
secure

753
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
I don't show everybody on YouTube your

754
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,619
password and so forth

755
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,079
um but what I wanted to show in here is

756
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,920
going into our

757
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,320
book info

758
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,180
and going into our graph

759
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,119
and it's probably because I'm just going

760
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,400
to go ahead and select a lot of these

761
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,859
things

762
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,460
oh that looks pretty not

763
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,060
foreign

764
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,339
so this should be that other diagram

765
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:02,220
within that slide but you can see the

766
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,240
services the Ingress and so forth so you

767
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
can go back and and look at that further

768
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,579
but what is nice

769
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:14,820
um is I can go in here and I can run a

770
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,900
curl I can hit my API if I do this a

771
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,680
whole bunch of times

772
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,079
and all of this is within

773
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,660
and all of this is within this document

774
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,180
to like walk through it so if you wanted

775
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,440
to look at your you know what's going on

776
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,780
yourself and you went through the

777
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,640
install from scratch you could run

778
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,280
through this demo and see how your

779
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,940
service meshes is behaving but the key

780
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,359
here is if I go into distributed tracing

781
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,900
and I go into

782
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,820
trace this

783
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,820
I should be able to drill down into well

784
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,480
what's going on when I hit my uh product

785
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,700
page when I hit my micro services

786
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,440
so again if we and this is using uh Rec

787
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,920
then I don't know if anybody's used that

788
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,440
there's some other tools out there too

789
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,380
so in closing

790
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,400
and uh I know what what we start at 3 45

791
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,940
so about 45 minutes

792
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,960
so uh in closing and then we'll do the

793
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,880
gifts if that's okay

794
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,180
and closing there are just a couple of

795
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,500
things that whoops

796
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,900
camo they're just a couple of things

797
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,319
that I wanted to close with and that is

798
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,780
we talked about no more castle and moat

799
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,540
the Assumption of once you get inside a

800
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
network you're safe and

801
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,780
the bad actor if he's kept out you're

802
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,119
good you have to assume there's a breach

803
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,520
inside your network at all times

804
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,280
so there is no more perimeter doesn't

805
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,140
mean you won't have a firewall doesn't

806
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,819
mean you won't have some of the things

807
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,940
that you already have but you won't

808
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,060
depend on that you'll make sure that all

809
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,920
the security capabilities are there and

810
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,619
it goes into end and it goes up the full

811
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,140
stack

812
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,780
and so multi-factor authentication and

813
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,619
encryption like I said that's a part of

814
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,560
what agencies have to make sure of by

815
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,800
2024 is done

816
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,420
and service mesh helps with

817
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,720
encryption helps authentication

818
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,359
authorization between Services of course

819
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,599
here for multi of factor authentication

820
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,240
for users there's different Technologies

821
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,440
for it one of those is

822
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,140
the red hat single sign-on plus others

823
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,859
and then the other two things to note is

824
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,960
when you look at all of this information

825
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,020
on zero trust

826
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,640
there's a big emphasis on us assess and

827
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,180
design and reviewing what you have and

828
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,640
the use cases so that you can make sure

829
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,319
all those capabilities and all those

830
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,359
pillars

831
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,700
that

832
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,640
you're making your security posture

833
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,500
better you're going through the maturity

834
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,000
model that we described so I'm going to

835
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,300
go ahead and stop they are in this

836
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,700
presentation

837
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,240
um there are some references

838
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,040
and I tried to make sure all the links

839
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,380
were in there and they were valid so you

840
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,800
can always email me if we go back to

841
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,800
oops if we go back to here if you scan

842
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,700
that that's my LinkedIn profile and

843
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,560
please connect with me on LinkedIn I'll

844
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,260
be able to be glad to answer any

845
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,480
questions

846
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,160
that you have and if I don't know the

847
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,079
answer I'll get somebody involved that

848
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,380
that you know has the answer for you and

849
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,119
I know we're getting

850
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,160
late in the day and there's still

851
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,740
football games going on so thanks for

852
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,780
everybody for staying with me hopefully

853
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,200
a lot all of it made sense

854
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,780
so let's go down here for we want to do

855
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,460
our giveaway

856
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,960
so

857
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,660
um go ahead and we'll open up the floor

858
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,780
ask me any questions if I don't know the

859
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,880
answer I will be glad to

860
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,760
to find out

861
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,640
if it's really deep then they have to

862
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,579
get back to you on it

863
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,180
yes

864
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:14,940
yes

865
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,960
yeah so are the the mics working

866
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,300
is there is there one over there you can

867
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,440
turn on

868
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,140
if not so it just to make sure so the

869
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,180
question was can I automate deployment

870
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,780
yes so I I will go back and update the

871
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,060
presentation there's a good Workshop

872
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,000
that one of the essays did

873
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,480
um with service mesh and what I was

874
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,579
trying to do on the hybrid Cloud that

875
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,460
has some ansible in it and some of it

876
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,220
she's seeing

877
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,079
kicks off with make install so I need to

878
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,319
change that to all ansible but that's a

879
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,260
very good question with ansible because

880
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,839
when we look at those zero trust pillars

881
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,160
and capabilities

882
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,740
automation spans the whole

883
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,619
of the pillars it's a very good question

884
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,740
so not only deployment but you have your

885
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,780
infrastructures code your compliances

886
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,160
code everything is code and ansible

887
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,319
as a good way to have your Automation

888
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,720
and plus it's a red hat product so I

889
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,800
love

890
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,440
even if it was so even if it wasn't red

891
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,060
hat I love ansible but Chef puppet

892
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,500
salt the others those are good

893
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,200
automation products too

894
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,660
yes

895
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,940
yes

896
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,960
you had to have them

897
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,520
that didn't work

898
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,660
so

899
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,779
um

900
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,339
so your question was my experiences with

901
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:15,000
service mesh and when you ask hybrid do

902
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,460
you are you referring to hybrid cloud or

903
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,839
use okay

904
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,960
so that's one of the big things red hat

905
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,560
is so I give a company explanation I

906
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,819
know you might want to turn a recording

907
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:30,900
off no I'm just kidding so uh there's uh

908
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,280
what red hat is doing and my opinion and

909
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,000
they do a line up well is red hat is

910
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,060
pushing on a lot of their sales plays

911
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,400
Going Back to Basics like Linux

912
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,099
Rel automation which was asked about a

913
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,960
minute ago and there and then their

914
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,339
third one

915
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,560
container platform I think was the third

916
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,599
so it's like those fall into different

917
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,339
sales plays

918
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:02,040
and so uh

919
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,040
they are starting to do more zero trust

920
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,240
within those and they're focusing not

921
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,260
just private which can be openstack open

922
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,920
shift bare metal or open shift whatever

923
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,220
I'm private but they're also doing the

924
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,980
hybrid model because

925
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,940
um

926
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,800
at times it's difficult with the

927
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,240
disconnected environment of the

928
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,160
government right well I have to get

929
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,380
everything on something and get it

930
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,619
internal because I don't have comms for

931
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,300
the internet

932
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,619
um

933
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,800
so at times it's difficult although we

934
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,200
have AWS and different classifications

935
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,200
but generally

936
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,780
the hybrid Cloud Model works well with

937
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,359
certain data and certain things going on

938
00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:00,480
AWS or Azure or Google cloud or one of

939
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,220
the cloud providers and a red hat has

940
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,960
some managed cloud services too

941
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,260
but then with your private Cloud that

942
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,099
definitely opens it up to

943
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:19,140
having more control over security and

944
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,140
what's coming into your network as far

945
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,660
as service mesh itself goes

946
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,960
I started with zero trust last year

947
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,540
looking a little bit closer at it and

948
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,660
talking to different customers like NASA

949
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,319
and FAA and some others and everybody

950
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:41,460
had what can I use what is the product I

951
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,839
can use to implement zero trust and

952
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,559
that's why I would say service mesh I

953
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,280
like it a lot to abstract some plus one

954
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,140
of the things I might have forgotten to

955
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,960
say is you want your proxy and your

956
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,800
sidecar where the application is not

957
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,140
dependent on having it there I should be

958
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,180
able to change the setting on my side

959
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,880
car gets deployed

960
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,859
um but with

961
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,500
um service mesh it fulfills some of

962
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,260
those zero trust capabilities so when

963
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,960
customers or talks take place around

964
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,300
zero trust oh I can use service mesh

965
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,359
then to solve a majority of the problems

966
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,339
no like I said

967
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:29,760
service mesh is a good Pro as a good

968
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,579
technology not just istio but there's

969
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:35,460
others right there's uh Linker and some

970
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,740
others

971
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,420
but it fulfills certain capabilities

972
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,900
there like we talked about especially in

973
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,480
TLS between services and that

974
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,760
authentication authorization

975
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,980
well we talked about it a minute ago

976
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,760
ansible fulfills another part

977
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,500
Advanced cluster security which is based

978
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,380
on stack rocks

979
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,780
and there's a just a Stig hopefully that

980
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,079
will come out soon on

981
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,000
openshift hardening for the platform and

982
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,700
the node but there's the compliance

983
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,300
effort too so I like service mesh a lot

984
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,099
especially when they talk about the

985
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:17,460
ambient mesh that's not into open shift

986
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,980
service mess yet

987
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,480
so I I know I'm kind of going

988
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,839
long-winded here but I like hybrid Cloud

989
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:30,480
talk about use cases and which is part

990
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,240
of that is better how to split those up

991
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,040
and maybe it is just private Cloud

992
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,900
that's needed but it's all use case

993
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,900
based and that maturity model like we

994
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,940
talked about so did we have another

995
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,720
price

996
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,260
all right well feel free to say are

997
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,000
there any other questions feel free to

998
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,359
send me anything on LinkedIn if I can

999
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,940
answer I will if not I'll find the

1000
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,460
answer and thanks for everybody staying

1001
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,599
late till

1002
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,720
or 440 right I enjoy

1003
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,780
you know grilling out football games

1004
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,220
whatever you're doing this evening
