1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,340
both okay uh this is not going to be a

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,599
highly technical talk I'm not going to

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,859
be popping shells I'm not going to be

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,539
showing you zero days et cetera so if

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,240
that's what you're really super into

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
I apologize

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,000
um

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,340
there were a couple of points

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,640
at times in that career that things

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,080
really kind of stuck in my head and I

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,700
didn't know quite why they did at the

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,280
time first one I'm going to mention was

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
out at Defcon one year and I forget if

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,719
it was concoto or DD Tech and they were

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,360
talking about what it takes to win at

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,500
CTF

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,899
uh they kind of did a panel uh after

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,760
they'd stopped running it and

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,920
got into the team composition and got

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
into the ways that they were gaming

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
people that were playing in the CTF one

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,940
of the things that they did is they

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,180
created things that were too good to

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,180
walk away from for Rock Star players

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,979
so the kind of thing where it's like at

26
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,420
the end of the weekend you've burnt all

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,119
your time and done nothing to help your

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,340
team get forward the other thing and

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,020
this is the one that really stuck in my

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,320
mind was they realized in looking at the

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,119
team composition and I expected as they

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,500
started that conversation it would be

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
like oh you need to have somebody that's

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,280
like at this level in Python Etc and

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,900
they went through some of that and they

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,180
wrapped it up though by saying and you

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,280
need someone that's willing to go for

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
pizza

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,759
which is to say that you need someone

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,140
that's willing to push back from the

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,400
table

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,680
someone that's willing to to stop the

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,939
competition and go take care of the

44
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,920
basic needs of the team and that stuck

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,180
in my head

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,860
second point

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,159
there is a information security uh

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,880
leader that uh I'm a a pretty big fan of

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
some of you may be familiar with them uh

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,720
they've run sold run sold run sold

51
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
companies for years and years and years

52
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,759
and at their conference one year they

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,579
got up on stage and they said that they

54
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,140
measure success

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,419
their measure of how successful they are

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,038
in achieving their outcome is the number

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,840
of analysts that they had sleeping on

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,420
the floor of data centers worldwide

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,459
and that really got stuck in my head and

60
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,980
as a manager on that team

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,200
I was thinking about what's that

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,300
experience like for the people on that

63
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,319
team

64
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,739
what's the experience for the families

65
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,920
of the people on that team

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,420
and that really kind of stuck in my head

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,819
now I posit that this person this person

68
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,640
said that partially in just and this

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,340
leader is known personally to me to roll

70
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,080
up their sleeves and dive in and move

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
Heaven and Earth for their people so I

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,920
know it wasn't meant maliciously

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,620
so I started kind of thinking about well

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,900
is that what it takes to be successful

75
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,599
in this role and I looked around me at

76
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,800
some of the people

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,239
thankfully in this room thanks for

78
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,360
coming and people that were legitimately

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,300
crushing it in this career

80
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,280
you know and started asking you know how

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,620
did you get good at what you did how did

82
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,519
you get to the point where you're

83
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,720
comfortable standing in front of a room

84
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,159
of other people and

85
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,200
doing a talk how did you get good enough

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,140
to be where you were so in a lot of

87
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,000
cases the answer was you know it's like

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,739
just like how do you know evil when you

89
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,720
see it oh I I just do

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,980
you know you learned that through

91
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,720
experience and bit by bit

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,180
so thinking about how you're building

93
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,760
career and then how do you take that

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,159
and teach other people how do you build

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,379
other other capable analysts other

96
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,060
capable responders

97
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,560
how do you lead those kind of people so

98
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,239
I started thinking about it and there

99
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,700
were some challenges there

100
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,379
so

101
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,319
thinking about those those superheroes

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,519
if you will

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
so those those Titans and thinking about

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,920
well what does it take to be good okay

105
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,819
both on my journey and and for others

106
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,080
um and started thinking about

107
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,140
the the stories that they would tell so

108
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,940
anybody ever sit down in a bull session

109
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,459
sit down after an incident sit down and

110
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,739
tell horrible stories of how many hours

111
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,540
you spend on the road how many hotel

112
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,000
rooms you are what status you have on

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
the airplanes and hotels how many hours

114
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,660
you've been away from home how many

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,418
hours you haven't slept how many uh

116
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,759
Red Bulls you've consumed anybody

117
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,040
familiar with this

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,979
okay

119
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,800
so it got me thinking about this isn't

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,919
just this isn't just the individuals

121
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,180
that we're talking about we're talking

122
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,440
about a culture

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,259
so now we're talking about hearing

124
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,520
culture we're not talking about heroism

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,620
okay heroism is an entirely different

126
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,440
thing there's certainly a need for it

127
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
um

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,020
sistrunk was talking earlier about

129
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,120
heroes that are postured to go respond

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,460
to the hurricane Etc not talking about

131
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,919
heroism have nothing but respect for

132
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,960
people that take heroic action when

133
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,220
necessary what we're talking about is

134
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,600
the culture

135
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,199
so why is that culture bad

136
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,340
now

137
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,419
there are going to be a couple of things

138
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,500
and I'm going to try to run through this

139
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
quickly fly through it if you will

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,220
without the cape I'm going to show you

141
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
some social media posts

142
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,240
okay this is to demonstrate culture I

143
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,699
appreciate it respect that I'm not

144
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,740
trying to out any individuals

145
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,720
I don't want you going after them this

146
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,300
is just examples of culture if I find

147
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,280
out that you went after them I'm going

148
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,320
to be really cranky

149
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
so

150
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,280
um hero culture you may be familiar with

151
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,539
some of these images

152
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,340
this is not an extensive list I've got

153
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,020
like seven slides of images that

154
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,720
companies have used who say we are a

155
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,780
superhero culture hire superheroes

156
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,539
right higher capes

157
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,780
so it's effective and evocative imagery

158
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,820
it sells especially to people outside of

159
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,160
here but it also reinforces the mindset

160
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,220
for us that we are superheroes

161
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,660
okay and what are superheroes

162
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,199
superheroes have made immense powers

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,479
more than more than mere mortals right

164
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,120
and superheroes are for the most part

165
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,280
not terribly vulnerable

166
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,919
this is problematic

167
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,660
so

168
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,580
here's the first screen

169
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,380
so here are some clues that you may be

170
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,000
existing in a hero culture anybody

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
familiar with any of these phrases as

172
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
part of their day-to-day firefighting

173
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,080
saved at the last minute

174
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,039
Etc

175
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,740
so has anybody heard these used as part

176
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,720
of your corporate above and beyond

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,819
Awards ceremonies

178
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,680
on a quarterly basis anybody receive

179
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,419
them

180
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,220
all right

181
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,380
so what's the problem with this

182
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,900
well first off we'll get into some of

183
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,419
the buckets why this is problematic But

184
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,960
Why Do Heroes like being Heroes

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
here's like being Heroes because there's

186
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,400
recognition believe it or not that

187
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
recognition on a social level stimulates

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,720
our brains

189
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
and feeds us all sorts of great

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,220
biochemical responses that make us feel

191
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
really really good

192
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
when we do it so almost to the point

193
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,160
where you learn that behavior in those

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,860
neural Pathways become self-reinforcing

195
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,800
so you almost get to the point where you

196
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,520
what

197
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,400
you're addicted to that energy you need

198
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,319
it you crave it

199
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,800
okay

200
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,460
so

201
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,479
we start talking about uh 2.5 2.7 3

202
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,520
million empty analyst chairs

203
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,319
this is a problem as a leader as a

204
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,520
manager as a person that interviews

205
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,800
people is a person that tries to work

206
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,500
with organizations to fill that Gap

207
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,880
and everybody's like we can't find

208
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
anybody

209
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,539
I think Workforce Development now I'm

210
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,039
thinking okay is there a juxtaposition

211
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,560
between

212
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,940
superheroes trying to find superheroes

213
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,740
develop superheroes need superheroes for

214
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,479
these roles and not having those analyst

215
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,319
chairs okay and why do people get cranky

216
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,340
in their jobs well they feel

217
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
underappreciated

218
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,880
they don't get called the recognition's

219
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
not there the recognition that We crave

220
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,660
that we need

221
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,639
so

222
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,460
again not trying to call anybody out

223
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,000
so that that tend towards narcissism and

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
this is not saying that we're evil or

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,180
we're bad what I'm saying is we work in

226
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,599
a culture that reinforces this Behavior

227
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,539
so here are a couple of things and

228
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,280
hopefully this will resonate for you and

229
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,500
my outcome here is I just want to get

230
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,300
thoughts percolating in your head and

231
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm going to give you some ways that

232
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
maybe you can start changing some of

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
this if this is the culture that you

234
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,399
live in

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,039
and maybe take a reflection and see is

236
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,479
this the culture we live in maybe I'm

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,000
off base so here's new villains who's

238
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,520
the bad guy

239
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,880
apt China right excellent who do we

240
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,740
spend most of our time

241
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,899
complaining about

242
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,240
apt China right

243
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,500
no

244
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,360
to our users the people that we're hired

245
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,640
to protect those idiots that click on

246
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
fishing links

247
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,820
the users that call up and about

248
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,860
password security or they can't get

249
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,820
done

250
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,220
whoops sorry

251
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,620
so morons I promised myself I wasn't

252
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,820
going to curse

253
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,480
so the the the very people that we are

254
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,260
that we are uh employed to protect are

255
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,640
our problem

256
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,320
so you think about all the fishing

257
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,640
exploits and uh there have been a couple

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,620
of great talks it was one great one at

259
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,600
uh social engineering at Defcon about

260
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,100
Kinder general or phishing campaigns

261
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,080
that I would suggest you go look for so

262
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,120
we create villains we need to have

263
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,680
villains and in some cases yeah it

264
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
probably should be apt should be bad

265
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,660
guys doing bad things but in a lot of

266
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,399
cases it's our users and what does this

267
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,680
do this also has the effect of creating

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
a wall between us and them because where

269
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
do we stand We Know Better

270
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,500
intellectually we know more

271
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,420
we're in the know and you're not

272
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,580
that's a problem

273
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,200
so

274
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
a couple of examples there

275
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
this release Heroes building silos

276
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
anybody ever have problem getting

277
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,560
documentation for somebody after an

278
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,100
incident or after a tool is deployed

279
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,080
we build knowledge silos WE wall

280
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,700
ourselves off we have a very us

281
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,279
indentment mentality

282
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,320
okay fed by that

283
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,060
some of you are sitting there going not

284
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,100
me this is not us

285
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,899
I'm fine with that

286
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,800
so we build silos in sometimes justify

287
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,920
by saying you are not capable of

288
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,180
securing the information that you need

289
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,640
to secure now this is true in many cases

290
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,399
however isn't our job to teach to build

291
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,959
systems that

292
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,260
allow people to do that also

293
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,180
isn't it job security if I'm the only

294
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,160
one that does the password to this they

295
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
can't fire me

296
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,420
so

297
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,480
that concept those reinforcing Concepts

298
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,040
move on

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,100
heroism in this role hero culture also

300
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,980
masks deeper problems

301
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,779
you think about all of the firefighting

302
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,760
that we do and in a lot of cases we talk

303
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
about that firefighting going to say the

304
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
reason we can't get stuff done right is

305
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,860
because we're constantly fighting fires

306
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,779
but it's actually the inverse

307
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,700
we're constantly fighting fires so we

308
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,620
don't have to do all the things right a

309
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,060
couple of the ransomware talks it's like

310
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,440
hey it's basically blocking and tackling

311
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,000
how many times have we put aside and

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
said you know what network segmentation

313
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
we'll get to it later we're too busy

314
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,640
fighting fires

315
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,300
so again everywhere every successful

316
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,760
ransomware campaign building those silos

317
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,380
separating ourselves

318
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,079
here's here's where it really gets nasty

319
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,480
not everybody can be a hero

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,459
okay this I wish I had more time to dig

321
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,779
into

322
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,480
but very quickly can someone look at

323
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,320
this

324
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,940
and tell me what seniority level

325
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,980
these questions are part of the

326
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,560
interview process for

327
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,440
entry level so now let me ask you this

328
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,140
let me ask you this are you saying entry

329
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,200
level because they're so wildly outside

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
of that or do you think these are

331
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,839
appropriate questions for an entry-level

332
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,019
job

333
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,420
there we go

334
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,240
yeah so this is this is on a Reddit

335
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,100
thread for internship positions

336
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,740
here's another one

337
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,940
for an internship position

338
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,399
this really pissed me off when I said it

339
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,260
so interns have Masters in cyber

340
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,820
security oh clearly that's an exception

341
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,740
now

342
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,899
it's the norm

343
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,100
so

344
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,779
anybody really familiar with Cobalt

345
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,579
strike can somebody answer this off

346
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,479
their off their cuff

347
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,420
how many years have you been working in

348
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,660
the business

349
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,500
yeah more

350
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,899
okay this again internship position

351
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,040
so there's this mythology that you've

352
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,600
got to have lots and lots and lots and

353
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
lots and lots of experience so we do

354
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,079
unbelievably well with gatekeeping

355
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,200
anybody ever been asked the what happens

356
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,079
when you Google question

357
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,079
so anybody ask it I know I'm asking for

358
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,160
a lot

359
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,019
okay what happens when I Google what are

360
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,800
we really asking

361
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,940
okay where do you want to start the

362
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,800
appropriate answer in my mind is

363
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,779
where do I start how much detail you

364
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,459
want so there's some people in the room

365
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,839
that can tell you exactly what happens

366
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,639
when the keyboard gets pressed and

367
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
depending on the type of keyboard

368
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
mechanical or electronic or can tell you

369
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,180
from there on what I'm really asking

370
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,579
what I'm asking that is for you to

371
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,260
interpret what my answer would be and

372
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,079
then parrot it back to me because if you

373
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,820
tell me something that's outside of my

374
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,220
experience what am I going to do

375
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,639
so now there's a principle called

376
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,860
homophily when we interview people and

377
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,839
we have a tendency to look for people

378
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,120
that know what we know and worse we have

379
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,500
a tendency to interview hire people that

380
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,260
look like we look

381
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,920
okay uh studies done in CIA FBI post

382
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,680
911. looking at the culture in those

383
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
organizations

384
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,399
so call these things out

385
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,540
so

386
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,339
again compsi doesn't make you an SME

387
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,980
send requests and these will be posted

388
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,720
zero knowledge

389
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,540
infosex not an entry level field gee I

390
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,420
wonder why we can't hire anybody for 2.7

391
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,579
to 3 million jobs

392
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,040
what's our responsibility

393
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,779
so this one really bugs me I'm not going

394
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,360
to go into a lot of detail so somebody

395
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,699
mentioned Equifax earlier

396
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,139
so

397
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,100
um

398
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,160
anybody knew who Peter zakko is

399
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
so hold your hand up if you know

400
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,199
excellent do you know what uh

401
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,600
so better known as

402
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,459
right do you know what mud studied in

403
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,600
college

404
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
music

405
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,860
Point made here is under my teams

406
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,920
anybody work with a brilliant jerk

407
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,939
how'd you feel as a team

408
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,220
so what'd it do for morale

409
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,620
tanked it brilliant jerks

410
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,440
so again I'm not trying to call anybody

411
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
out but if you followed anything

412
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,320
recently you followed this Exchange

413
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,360
foreign

414
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,339
I promised I wasn't going to curse so I

415
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,720
can't tell you the name of the book but

416
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,620
I'll post a link on my socials

417
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,079
this is exactly it systematically allows

418
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,639
them to enjoy special advantages and

419
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,899
interpersonal relationships and

420
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,699
transnational entitlements that immune

421
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,560
immunizes them this is the brilliant

422
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,860
jerk this is fostered by and encouraged

423
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,660
by Hero culture how many times you can

424
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,740
work with somebody that are like you

425
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,240
know what they're brilliant but you

426
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,560
can't put them in a room with other

427
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,579
people

428
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,459
and we tolerate it

429
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,399
coming up on five really bad behavior

430
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,019
this is a really scary stuff and I'm

431
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,880
going to walk a razor's edge here

432
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,699
a culture does what so we Elevate people

433
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,139
we put them on a pedestal and makes them

434
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,420
unassailable so when they do really bad

435
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,000
creepy criminal potentially criminal

436
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,540
things it makes us hard to go and do

437
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,420
anything about it we've probably seen a

438
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,000
lot of this for some of you what's worse

439
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,399
is we work in a culture where people

440
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,639
have for years allowed people to do bad

441
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,040
things to our people without saying

442
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
anything because they were honestailable

443
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,720
and they were the the

444
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,560
smartest person in the room if you will

445
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,940
so we can talk a little bit more about

446
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,820
that offline bad behaviors though

447
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,639
how many hours of sleep does a CSO get

448
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,560
in night

449
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,839
there you go so we encourage that right

450
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,880
no sleep

451
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,639
so ctfs we're a couple of talks this

452
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,320
morning about this it's like oh I know

453
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,360
showers I worked on it for 72 hours et

454
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,679
cetera how many times have you been to a

455
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,740
con where the CTF goes all weekend

456
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,839
built into our culture that we do these

457
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,859
things

458
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,319
so spare time no I don't have spare time

459
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,119
I don't have hobbies I don't have to do

460
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,679
you know what go take a walk I don't

461
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,220
have time to go take a walk I'm too busy

462
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,720
so

463
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,480
so what do we do we self-medicate

464
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
so play hard

465
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,839
work hard

466
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,160
how many times have you been to a con

467
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,600
where the after hours events were what

468
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,580
drink all you can

469
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,340
so self-medicate

470
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,740
so why are your people burned out

471
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,039
well also everything's an emergency if

472
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,539
you're firefighting and that's your only

473
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,340
response everything's got to be an

474
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,980
emergency I've told you hey anything

475
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,360
happens you call me in I'm going to

476
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,460
bring the whole team in Shield's up

477
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
right

478
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,780
so and even if you're lucky to get the

479
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,679
job

480
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,780
so what do most people tell you work

481
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,000
your way through it

482
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,620
so it's going to suck for a couple years

483
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,480
and then you'll be qualified and get a

484
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
job in a culture that you really like

485
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,380
okay this just happened for an

486
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,760
unfortunate person working for one of

487
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,840
the big four

488
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,140
in Southeast Asia with horrible results

489
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,120
Heroes burn out

490
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,200
so some stats here first off 32 changing

491
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
jobs in the next six months

492
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,720
obviously looking from 2018 to 2022

493
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,059
kovitz had a dramatic effect on things

494
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,480
and shifted things quite a bit for folks

495
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
51 percent

496
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,960
and this is a threat connect survey from

497
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,740
this year 51 of the professionals that

498
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,660
you know suffered depression anger

499
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,860
anxiety

500
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,660
claim there was not enough Talent on the

501
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,559
team

502
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,419
said you can't find skilled

503
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,039
professionals

504
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,600
and said

505
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,220
their staff turned over in the last 12

506
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,340
months 67 I worked a lot of years in the

507
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,020
restaurant I've never seen numbers like

508
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,720
that in the restaurant business

509
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,539
so anybody familiar suffer these

510
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,340
headaches fatigue sleeping anxiety

511
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,260
muscle tension drop in workplace

512
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,179
performance feeling overwhelmed and

513
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,720
unable to cope You Are Not Alone

514
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,320
so quickly looking at this

515
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
how far down on the list do you have to

516
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,000
get to before you get to the enemy

517
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,559
10.

518
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,020
losing the adversaries

519
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,299
so looking at this list those of you

520
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,679
that lead people

521
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,299
how many other things above that things

522
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,799
that you could alleviate and take care

523
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,620
of if needed how many of these are the

524
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,880
responsible of the culture in the

525
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,220
workplace that we work in

526
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,539
so

527
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,700
Heroes need villains build silos create

528
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,500
exclusions Etc et cetera and again

529
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,419
obviously slides up

530
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,200
what can you do about it there is hope

531
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,520
one first thing understand your culture

532
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,919
reflect look at it think about it I know

533
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,600
it's not the sexiest thing but think

534
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,220
about the signals that you're getting

535
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,840
and the the things that are being

536
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,700
communicated and the words that you're

537
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
using to communicate them

538
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
look at your recruiting and hiring

539
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,900
process

540
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,760
to see if you are unintentionally

541
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,799
gatekeeping

542
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,419
you're if you're unintentionally

543
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,860
stopping people from coming and

544
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,960
welcoming into the jobs things like you

545
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,160
must have

546
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,600
a cissp for an entry level position

547
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,179
there you go transform heroic Behavior

548
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,400
into transformal transformational

549
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,260
opportunity look at systems and

550
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,120
processes if you've come in again I

551
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,820
started out a kid of an engineer problem

552
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,220
isn't solved until you've what made a

553
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,039
change so it never happens again right

554
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,220
so eliminate educate brilliant jerks

555
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,840
call them out on their behavior and if

556
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,880
they won't change get rid of them let

557
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,440
them go work somewhere else

558
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,240
so build collaborative diverse and

559
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,679
healthy teams

560
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,220
so adopt that behavior make diversity

561
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,179
and inclusion and Equity a kpi for your

562
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,240
teams diversity builds better teams more

563
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,340
resilient teams teams that are able to

564
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,440
help balance a lot of the stress and a

565
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,820
lot of the workload and give you other

566
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,440
perspectives

567
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,960
update recognition and awards to not say

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
oh this team worked all weekend and

569
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,380
overnight

570
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,700
value reward collaboration innovation

571
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,260
so and then take action the community

572
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,539
I'm a big fan of bystander intervention

573
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,940
so the the 5Ds if you're not familiar

574
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,440
again I'll share some links with you

575
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
this is a you don't actually have to

576
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,860
jump in and white night and do something

577
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,780
about it but you can document you can

578
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,000
check on people

579
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,419
um uh great book by uh activist by the

580

name of Shawna Porter on making spaces

581
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,740
safer so when you're at cons when you're

582
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,720
meetings and stuff like that to improve

583
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,700
that examine and think about

584
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,760
implementing code of conduct

585
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,020

586
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,280
you to walk out of here

587
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,419
normalize being okay asking for help if

00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,020
you're a leader make it okay to say I

589
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,100
don't know

590
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,620

591
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,959
