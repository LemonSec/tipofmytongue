1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,519
so

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,020
all right

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,800
thank you

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,420
can you guys hear me

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,100
hear me all back there

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,779
no you can't hear me

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,240
why are you kidding are you uh for real

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,959
flip the switch

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,760
they gave me two of these things

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,420
like which one is

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,100
this one okay

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,559
there you go now can you hear me all

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,140
right cool audio technical difficulties

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,820
are solved

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,840
all right let's put this back

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,680
all right hey well thanks for uh thanks

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,780
for coming I know I got the after lunch

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,280
special so I'm going to try to entertain

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,440
you guys keep you guys uh awake and

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,180
focused but today I'm going to be

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,199
talking about

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
um how you can take back control of your

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,400
Security operation Center or sock as you

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,979
all know with risk-based alerting you

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,200
might hear me say RBA just short for

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,299
risk-based alerting

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,700
all right so who am I so my name is

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,920
Billy Huang I'm a practice lead for data

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
analytics uh at guidepoint security we

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,939
have a booth out there so if you guys

31
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,220
want to come visit us and talk uh we

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,860
partnered with tines and we're between

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,939
the raffle

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,820
raffle counter and the pick locking lock

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,460
pick um so it's hard not not hard to uh

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,500
to find us so I currently live in

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,659
Raleigh North Carolina drove through the

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,640
hurricane to get here just to talk with

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
you guys yesterday uh but I'm a cyber

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,220
security engineer by Nature I primarily

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,960
work with Splunk the seam you know

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,840
Splunk but I also then ventured and

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,340
started working with different Security

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,320
orchestration on Mission response tools

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
like Splunk sword which is formerly

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,700
called Phantom and then also tines as

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,920
well so gotta give a shout out to them

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,079
um and then I also spent quite a bit of

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,540
time working Insider threat detection as

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,540
well utilizing RBA uh I did nine years

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,639
in the Army uh I was in Air Defense

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,879
Artillery then uh went cyber uh for my

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,860
last three years and then I got out in

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,900
2019 I've been just doing primarily a

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,060
security since then

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,819
what I do outside of work I got three

57
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,340
boys three little boys and I busy

58
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,920
coaching them breaking up fights you

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,599
know running around with them doing

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,220
soccer and baseball and things of that

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,720
nature

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
all right so uh this is a short

63
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,800
lightning talk so I'm gonna try to power

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,260
through these I do want to do a demo uh

65
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,480
in Splunk at the very end so uh we'll

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,980
try to save questions at the end if if

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,300
possible but if you've got something

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,160
pressing just raise your hand

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,220
so traditionally socks you know they've

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,840
got correlation searches that they built

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,940
or detections and those detections

72
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,120
create alerts now you know these alerts

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,099
what we've seen is that in 40 of

74
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,140
organizations they're getting 10 000

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,120
alerts a day this may not just be coming

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,500
from their Sim but it might be coming

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,120
from their EDR solution you know

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,860
different solutions that are just

79
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,660
pounding you know pounding the sock with

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,720
alerts and what I've seen is at least 50

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,879
percent if not more you're getting a lot

82
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,040
of false positives uh and so you know

83
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,019
you're chasing down these alerts you're

84
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,879
you're constantly um

85
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,680
what we're seeing is you know you're

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,300
abandoning these alerts you know like

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,680
when you pick up your phone and you get

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,239
the same notification over and over from

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,099
the app you actually end up being blind

90
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,360
to that right because you see that

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
notification so many times you're blind

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,099
so people are abandoning their alerts

93
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,959
they've created them they determine that

94
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,400
they're horrible and they're just

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,260
forgetting about it

96
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,060
people are constantly tuning their their

97
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,500
searches

98
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,299
um tuning is is the right thing to do

99
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,739
right because you want to make your

100
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,200
searches uh more efficient more accurate

101
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,879
but they're just spending so much time

102
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,980
tuning then they're also creating

103
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,860
suppressions in whitelists

104
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,480
so many suppressions that you may

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,879
actually end up suppressing you know

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,099
true positives so that's bad

107
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,720
and then also just a very noisy

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
environment so many of you guys might

109
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,260
have heard we're getting a lot of alert

110
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,360
fatigue in your sock

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,379
um

112
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,200
so actually before I go on how many

113
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,420
people here have played with Splunk

114
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,099
all right so cool cool a lot of a lot of

115
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,299
people

116
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,880
um yeah so just getting tons of alert

117
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,478
fatigue uh you know it's just

118
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,960
busy and mundane work right

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,880
so we've got two problems that we want

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,979
to try to solve the first how can

121
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,440
security teams reduce alert fatigue

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
while improving their overall security

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,040
coverage right we want to decrease

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,080
alerts but we want to make our alerts

125
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,280
better

126
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,320
second is how can security teams shift

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,419
their triage investigations to higher

128
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,520
Fidelity alerts so now let's create

129
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,440
higher Fidelity alerts let's create only

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,720
alerts that give us that meaningful and

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,440
contextual information

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,479
all right so let's introduce RBA

133
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,759
so now right we create correlation

134
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,860
searches or detections now instead of

135
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,419
having those give you a one for one

136
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,400
alert now we're sending all that to your

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,440
Risk Index so you guys all know what an

138
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,300
index isn't Splunk is right pretty much

139
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,340
just a data repository somewhere where

140
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,680
you can organize your data

141
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,139
um and search efficiently and Splunk

142
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,020
so now all those uh alerts that we we

143
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,900
had that was pounding the sock instead

144
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,180
of having alerts let's let's shift all

145
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,460
that information into a Risk Index and

146
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,020
let's store it all there

147
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,180
so in this scenario we're going to be

148
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,220
using Splunk Enterprise security has

149
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,259
anyone heard of yes Splunk yes

150
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,300
so it's a Premium app that you have to

151
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,060
get on top of your Splunk so you'll

152
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,580
create another es search head and then

153
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,340
that's got a lot of um really cool like

154
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,199
security configurations and stuff that

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,620
you can do

156
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
all right

157
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,460
so now inside that Risk Index we're

158
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,560
going to add some extra contextual

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,300
information so the first thing we're

160
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,220
going to add a risk score and the cool

161
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,780
thing about this risk score is it's not

162
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,160
just static it's going to be very

163
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Dynamic based on

164
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,539
you know who the user or what NT hosts

165
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,860
we're talking about

166
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,259
we're going to tie in the miter attack

167
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,880
framework we're going to add a tactic

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,699
and a technique to each of these alerts

169
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,320
next we can also add any type of

170
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,759
vulnerability data you have a

171
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,780
vulnerability

172
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,280
um system where you want to add

173
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,840
something from the outside like a third

174
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,000
party you can integrate that into your

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,539
uh each of your your Risk Index events

176
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,520
now what we're going to do is this Risk

177
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
Index holds an immense amount of

178
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,539
contextual data it's great data now

179
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,220
we're going to formulate our alerts and

180
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,259
notables based on the Risk Index

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,479
all right

182
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,520
so we've got

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,840
um two different things I want to talk

184
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,699
about here we've got Risk rules or RR

185
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,639
we've got risk indicator rules so on the

186
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,060
left side you've got our old alerts

187
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,100
we're renaming them as Risk rules so you

188
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,139
had you know an anomalous login rule

189
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,120
that or detection originally was an

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,919
alert now we're just going to send that

191
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,840
to the Risk Index you've got data

192
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,220
exfiltration data you want to put in

193
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,380
there all the all that's that really

194
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,419
interesting stuff that may not be

195
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,340
malicious in nature we're going to put

196
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,139
that to the Risk Index right we don't

197
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,520
want to get alerted on every single one

198
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,400
of those right for example a um

199
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
uh an account lockout right that happens

200
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,300
like you depending on how big your

201
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,860
organization is you might get hundreds

202
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,919
of those account lockout event codes and

203
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,319
they may not be I mean 99 of the time

204
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,880
those are false positives so we're going

205
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,979
to shift that all into the Risk Index

206
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,060
now we're going to call we're going to

207
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,240
create risk indicator rules or rirs and

208
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
that's going to

209
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
look at all that data inside your Risk

210
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,580
Index and we're going to make the alerts

211
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,680
from there so a couple of the ones you

212
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,199
can create right off the top of the uh

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,620
um top of the right off the bat sorry uh

214
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,180
the first one is the risk score

215
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,880
threshold exceed so we can now say hey

216
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,840
if a certain user or certain NT host

217
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,340
exceeds this particular risk score now I

218
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,280
want to get a an alert

219
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
um how about multiple attack tactics now

220
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,740
maybe this particular user they've done

221
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,840
a certain number of

222
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,479
um things that have crossed over two or

223
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,860
three different miter attack tactics

224
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,440
right they went from

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,199
um detection to exfiltration to

226
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,699
something else right so now we're

227
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,340
interested in that

228
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,740
um maybe we can look at exfiltration in

229
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,300
a certain sequence of events this is

230
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,280
really good for Insider threat because

231
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,500
let's say we want to look at our

232
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
particular set of order

233
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,539
for example someone plugs in a USB now

234
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,279
they're requesting a permanent or a

235
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,020
temporary exception to the rule to use

236
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,120
that USB now we're seeing them actually

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,940
exfiltrate you know hundreds of Megs or

238
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,820
gigabytes to that that USB

239
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,560
um right so now we see that particular

240
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,479
sequence that we can alert on

241
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
all right so key terminology

242
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,760
uh so Risk rules and risk indicator

243
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,399
rules we talked about those risk objects

244
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,959
so now that's going to be your point of

245
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,200
Interest inside the Risk Index

246
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,880
um so this could be a username this

247
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,620
could be an IP address an NT host right

248
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,620
this is a particular unique

249
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,080
um point of interest that we have the

250
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,760
second is the risk object type we're

251
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,860
going to categorize these in two

252
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,940
different types we're going to call them

253
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,640
an asset or an identity an asset would

254
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,380
be like a physical machine a server a

255
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,420
computer an identity is going to be

256
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,300
associated with a user or an email

257
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,060
Now with uh Enterprise security

258
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,920
accident you might hear as an identities

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,240
a lot because you're going to configure

260
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,399
that initially off the bat when you set

261
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,920
up Enterprise security what you do and

262
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,480
with the asset identities is you're

263
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,360
going to now say hey I see

264
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,959
um

265
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,779
this particular asset it may be a domain

266
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,640
controller or some type of privileged

267
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,279
server that's going to be uh have a

268
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,019
priority level of you know a critical

269
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,480
priority level compared to a regular

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,240
user host machine right because that's

271
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
going to be way more interesting than if

272
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,620
we see something happening on a host a

273
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,880
regular host machine

274
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
just like an identity if we see a

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,000
particular user like an admin user a

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,399
service account a privileged user that's

277
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,860
going to be way more interesting than

278
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,800
um just a regular user now I'm going to

279
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,080
show this in another slide but now you

280
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,720
can actually set your risk score

281
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,360
and you can set um you can variate that

282
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,940
based on the the critical criticality

283
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,720
level of your asset or identity

284
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,339
so going on your wrist sub your risk

285
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,200
score would be your assigned numerical

286
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,839
value so generally at the higher the

287
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,180
risk score uh the riskier

288
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,740
and then your threat object is an

289
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,380
optional field that you can put in a lot

290
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,180
of times people will put specific iocs

291
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,760
in there so if you see a hash or

292
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,140
anything like that you can actually say

293
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,040
hey set this md5 hash as an into the

294
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,420
hash field and we can use that for

295
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,319
threat hunting in the future

296
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,839
all right so the benefits of uh risk

297
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,600
scoring so RBA gives you the ability to

298
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
modify scores based on the criticality

299
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,860
level of a specific asset or identity so

300
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,120
kind of like I was saying your priority

301
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
levels in the middle are critical high

302
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,820
medium low and informational

303
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,160
um on the left side here you can see

304
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,620
we're editing the risk factor risk

305
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,500
factor editor inside es and this allows

306
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,959
us to say whenever I see a high priority

307
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
user I'm going to take that score and

308
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,940
I'm going to multiply it by 1.25

309
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,220
so pretty much one particular

310
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,200
correlations church that you create

311
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,420
may not have the same score

312
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,519
so on the right side you can see

313
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,920
um we have the risk analysis this is an

314
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,839
Adaptive response action so when you

315
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,339
create a correlation search in Splunk

316
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,680
you can actually use this drop down for

317
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,839
setting the risk score

318
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,000
setting the risk objects and then all

319
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,740
that gets then sent to your risk Risk

320
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,579
Index

321
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,560
so you can see here we've got a default

322
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,079
risk score of 80. so anything that comes

323
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,420
in here that particular correlation

324
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,860
search is going to give you a score of

325
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,380
80. now let's say

326
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,519
we find out that the person who um

327
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,160
uh the person who you know wrote this

328
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,160
malicious Powershell process maybe uh

329
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,220
they had a user priority of high so now

330
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,300
we're going to take that 80 and we're

331
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,880
going to multiply it by 1.25 we're gonna

332
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,459
we're gonna get a higher score

333
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,620
down here you can see um at the bottom

334
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,899
we got threat object so you're able to

335
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,459
include the md5 field is a hash so you

336
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,260
can you can include that into your Risk

337
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,560
Index

338
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,920
all right

339
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,459
all right so how do you create a risk

340
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,980
rule uh risk rule a correlation search

341
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,480
is very similar to a save search in

342
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Splunk core but in es you're going to

343
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,279
create as a correlation search so the

344
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,240
first thing you're going to do is you're

345
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,279
going to write your SPL your your Splunk

346
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,260
search processing language so that's

347
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,480
going to be the base of your detection

348
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,440
sometimes you're going to use just you

349
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,420
know index equals and Source type equals

350
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,399
you may use a t stats if your data

351
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,980
models are configured correctly

352
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,860
um a lot of times in in es you're the

353
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,720
one of the things to configure es is to

354
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,540
set your data models and um have those

355
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,940
being whitelisted

356
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,920
so we're going to create this the Splunk

357
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,180
SPO

358
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,639
uh next thing is we're going to choose a

359
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,620
miter attack tactic and technique so you

360
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,339
can see down here

361
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,820
yeah there you go you can see down here

362
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,079
miter attack we're using the t1485

363
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,420
um and I think that is

364
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,639
that's for Data Destruction that's the

365
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
particular technique because this is

366
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
looking for ransomware so we're looking

367
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,260
at Data Destruction you can also use the

368
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,720
CIS 20 you can use kill chain you can

369
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
use nist I primarily like to use miter

370
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,160
attack

371
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,420
uh next thing is you're going to

372
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,100
schedule to schedule the search so

373
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,000
you're going to look up here you're

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
going to schedule it based on a cron

375
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
schedule you look at your earliest and

376
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,560
latest time that's going to be your time

377
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,000
range

378
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,380
then down here you can actually

379
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,500
configure the throttling so throttling

380
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,120
is going to tune out any duplicate

381
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
events say you look back 60 minutes now

382
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
you're going to throttle and you're

383
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,880
going to say I don't want to look at

384
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
anything within that other that 60

385
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,120
minutes so you're going to be able to

386
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,820
factor out duplicates

387
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,220
and the last thing is setting your

388
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,260
adaptive response action so that's going

389
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,200
to be the risk analysis adaptive

390
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,720
response action which takes that sets a

391
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,779
risk score and then um sends all that

392
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,920
information to your Risk Index

393
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,600
now how do you create a risk indicator

394
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,399
rule so risk indicator rule is also

395
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,680
correlation search and Es

396
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,100
we name this one the attack tactic uh

397
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,199
threshold exceeds for an object over the

398
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,940
previous seven days so we're looking at

399
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,500
a seven day period and we're making

400
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
we're checking to see if a particular

401
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,699
risk object so a user an asset and

402
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,980
identity if they cross over three

403
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,920
different miter attack tactics

404
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,779
so here you can see we're using a

405
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,600
t-stats command we're looking at the

406
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,639
Risk Index data model

407
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
and we're saying hey let's let's check

408
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,899
to see when

409
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,540
um a particular miter attack tactic ID

410
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,480
count is greater than or equal to three

411
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,339
uh this one on the right side is

412
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,060
actually looking at the um risk score if

413
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,980
that succeeded a certain threshold in

414
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,800
the last uh last 24 hours so this one we

415
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,959
actually set to be static we're saying

416
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,500
we're trying to see whenever um a risk

417
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,540
score for a risk object has exceeded a

418
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,660
hundred in the past 24 hours now one

419
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,519
thing to note is as you create more Risk

420
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,519
rules and you've got a lot of a lot more

421
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,779
data in that contextual data in your

422
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,800
Risk Index

423
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,019
your actual risk score you may have to

424
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,940
actually edit that and so I've done

425
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,680
things in the past where instead of

426
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,339
having a static uh risk threshold in

427
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,500
this case it's a hundred I actually will

428
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,120
look at the Risk Index and I'm going to

429
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,279
do some statistical standard deviation

430
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,860
and I'm going to see hey based on my

431
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,459
environment what is the average

432
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,800
risk score amongst everybody now I'm

433
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,779
going to do some standard deviation and

434
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm going to say I want to look at the

435
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,940
top

436
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,540
um 2.5 percent uh of you know when you

437
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,680
do like a bell curve you're going to

438
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,760
look at that top and you're going to

439
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,980
look whenever someone exceeds that bell

440
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,500
curve we're going to now um

441
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,079
uh trigger an alert so there's different

442
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,760
ways to do this you can create a static

443
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,060
threshold or you can do it dynamically

444
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,439
by looking at your overall environment

445
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,720
all right so after uh your risk

446
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,820
indicator rules created all that stuff

447
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,800
actually gets sent to your at your

448
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,560
notable index so your uh so index equals

449
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,779
notable that's where that stores all

450
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,519
your your alerts

451
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,380
and then you can actually see all that

452
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,180
in the incident review page

453
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,980
um that's the dashboard that a lot of

454
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,320
the sock analysts will will utilize to

455
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,420
check their alerts they can assign them

456
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,360
to themselves they can then run drill

457
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,000
downs and queries from the uh

458
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
the incident review page

459
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,579
all right so other considerations

460
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,339
so the Risk Index is a great place to do

461
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,099
preliminary threat hunting uh so like

462
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,260
you can look for iocs

463
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,280
um

464
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
the data is organized in there so it

465
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,660
actually allows you to look over a long

466
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,059
period of time so that people anybody

467
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,100
here if you're looking at like firewall

468
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,320
data or proxy data if you start looking

469
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
over 24 hours right your search becomes

470
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,720
super slow because of you know just the

471
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,520
quantity of events you have in the

472
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,340
firewall or proxy Index right

473
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,320
so now all that data is in your Risk

474
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
Index all that interesting data you can

475
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,179
look back 30 days 90 days you can look

476
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,340
for those low and slow

477
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,299
um uh attacks and that's pretty pretty

478
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,039
neat

479
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,840
uh and then also like like I mentioned

480
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,160
before you can look for patterns or

481
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,440
sequence of events this is great you can

482
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
use the transaction command and you can

483
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,100
actually start looking at

484
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,760
um

485
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,700
uh for that sequence of events

486
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,200
another great thing is you can build

487
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,240
dashboards to quickly see patterns and

488
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,160
Trends in your apartment so this one

489
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,480
right here is your risk analysis

490
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,100
dashboard

491
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,320
um great for you know sock managers and

492
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,539
and management and stuff they can start

493
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,980
looking at their environment and seeing

494
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,660
you know some of those Trends they can

495
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,700
see if they're going up or down they can

496
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,660
see

497
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,480
um pie charts of different uh scoring

498
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,760
and different miter attack or you know

499
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,260
CIS 20 or nist you know the different

500
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,360
Frameworks where all of your your alerts

501
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,940
and detections are coming from

502
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,460
um they can quickly see here like top uh

503
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,700
risk objects right so you can see

504
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
um certain IP addresses and certain

505
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,960
users right they bubble up to the top

506
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,460
because they have the higher risk scores

507
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,740
compared to other users

508
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,419
you can even look at

509
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,460
um most active sources so these are your

510
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,580
Risk rules uh you know you can see which

511
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,679
ones are firing the most do I need to

512
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,720
maybe tune them a little bit

513
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,440
um

514
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,179
are these Maybe

515
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,860
not interesting to me maybe I can

516
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,960
actually take them out so you can see

517
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,860
that

518
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,639
um over here

519
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,340
uh and then the second thing is the the

520
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,500
more um

521
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,200
uh the more Risk rules you create the

522
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,220
more accurate your alerts actually

523
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,559
become right so the more data you can

524
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,900
populate into your Risk Index

525
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,640
um just the better Fidelity alerts that

526
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,780
you'll have

527
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,500
um that's really important

528
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,480
all right so let's look inside Splunk

529
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,380
I'm gonna do it in time

530
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,299
10 minutes okay thanks

531
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,660
oh

532
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,600
thank you

533
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,439
there we go okay

534
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,200
all right so first thing I want to show

535
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,780
you guys is Let's uh

536
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,240
maximize this a little bit

537
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,640
first thing I want to show you guys is

538
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
uh the assets and identities that I

539
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
talked about so here you can see we're

540
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,820
looking at lookup assets and by the way

541
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,340
sorry this is a this is a demo

542
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,140
environment so it's not actual

543
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,240
production data and so has anyone here

544
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
done boss of the sock

545
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,100
yeah so we're actually using Bots uh

546
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,559
version 4 data here so you might see

547
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,080
some like interesting like Splunk Splunk

548
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,360
uh users here

549
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,679
so the first thing I wanted to show you

550
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,260
here is

551
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,380
our assets look up so let's go ahead and

552
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,980
run this

553
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,539
all right so you can see

554
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,220
so some of these NT hosts right we've

555
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,460
got Acme o one to six we've got

556
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,320
different different hosts we set the

557
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,760
priority level

558
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,400
uh for each of these now this lookup is

559
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
actually generated from it can be

560
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,780
generated from a cmdb database right so

561
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,179
we take a CMD database bring that data

562
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,059
into Splunk then we run a search that

563
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,520
will then output the lookup to

564
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,039
this lookup assets.csv and we're going

565
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,840
to assign a priority level to each of

566
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,419
these so we assign High to all the

567
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,840
Acme's we sign a critical to this

568
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,539
particular one zero zero six and we also

569
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,460
check the category so these are all PCI

570
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,179
related NT hosts

571
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,740
um and you can see here we got PCI

572
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,220
virtual these are all signed mediums

573
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,260
and as we go down we've got

574
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,760
um lows and we've got you know different

575
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,700
different categories here

576
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,400
so same thing if we were to look at um

577
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,840
identities instead of

578
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,600
assets

579
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,760
okay

580
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,159
very good okay

581
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,559
um so we if we sort this By Priority

582
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,440
level now we can see particular assets

583
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,799
that are critical versus uh high medium

584
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,960
low here so it's very important that

585
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,120
when you configure es assets and

586
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,400
identities have to be properly

587
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,740
configured and tuned

588
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,380
next thing I want to show you guys is uh

589
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,120
the threat intelligence management so if

590
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,799
you were to come to configure

591
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,480
data enrichment and come to threat

592
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
intelligence management this is where

593
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,240
you can actually bring in third party

594
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,400
data so in this case we're bringing

595
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,559
miter attack data and we're grabbing it

596
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,380
from GitHub this actually gets updated

597
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,020
um every 24 hours and so if there's new

598
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,120
tactics or techniques T numbers that get

599
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,220
added uh it can it's going to

600
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,640
continuously upgrade update here

601
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,559
so then here

602
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,840
we actually take all that miter attack

603
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,100
data and we're going to put it into the

604
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,539
miter attack lookup

605
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,340
now here I'm searching for the

606
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,260
particular tactic of discovery

607
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,720
but this is where you can see all the T

608
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
Numbers right so we're the tactic is

609
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
Discovery we've got all the sub

610
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,559
techniques here and our T Numbers here

611
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,380
so this is actually what allows you to

612
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,659
um in your correlation search

613
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,780
um assign a t a miter tactic and

614
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,760
technique to your uh to your correlation

615
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,059
search

616
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,340
all right

617
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,780
all right so next we're going to be

618
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,059
looking at our risk our Risk Index now

619
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,440
in this case I'm using our data model

620
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,940
because your Risk Index if you

621
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,620
accelerate it you can put it into a data

622
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,280
model

623
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,140
so the first thing you can do I'm going

624
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,640
to create a search where I'm going to

625
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,820
look for just risk objects that have a

626
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,140
high count of a high count of particular

627
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,120
risk rules that triggered so in this

628
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,940
case if we sort by count we can see that

629
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,799
some of these have bubbled to the top so

630
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,080
this person fyodor at the

631
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,179
splunkshardcompany.com we've got frothly

632
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,080
we've got particular IP addresses

633
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,179
and so these these have all been uh

634
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,460
these are all particular risk objects

635
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,140
that have a high number of Risk rules

636
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,620
triggered

637
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,020
now

638
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,900
all right so now I want to actually get

639
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,520
a value of all the different search

640
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,620
names that that person has triggered so

641
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,380
in this case you can see frothly they've

642
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,559
detected four different AWS login type

643
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,799
logins to the console uh fyota they've

644
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,720
done some type of malicious Powershell

645
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,480
process they've there's been an unusual

646
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,940
volume of outbound traffic just

647
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,559
different different searches that uh

648
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,059
that this particular person has

649
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,960
triggered

650
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,820
now if we want to go a little bit deeper

651
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,520
now we can actually pull out

652
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,400
the scores for these people so

653
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,900
in this case we're going to look at the

654
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
risk object type we're going to look at

655
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,539
their search name their risk score

656
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,640
risk message and all different things

657
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
so we're still sorting by count so

658
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,600
that's why few order is at the top but

659
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,340
you can see that over the last seven

660
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,360
days

661
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,020
there's some risk score has been

662
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,919
exceedingly High

663
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,640
um

664
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,980
this person is also all you know

665
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,440
triggered I think six distinct different

666
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,460
searches uh Risk rules these are all the

667
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,860
different risk messages for them and uh

668
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,360
different minor attacks so you can see

669
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,158
it's crossed uh it's

670
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,620
um

671
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,279
it's um it's crossed over uh five four

672
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,860
different techniques and six different

673
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,480
or five different no sorry four

674
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,700
different tactics right here

675
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,320
um so if we want to actually do

676
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,400
something else we can actually do a

677
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,779
distinct count so let's say a distinct

678
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,320
count of

679
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,700
foreign

680
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:05,360
attacker here

681
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,460
DC miter tactic

682
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,200
and now we can actually have we can see

683
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,120
here that it's um

684
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,980
triggered four distinct different miter

685
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,279
tactics

686
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,640
all right so the last thing I want to

687
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,100
show you is the risk analysis dashboard

688
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,740
this I had a screenshot in there but as

689
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,000
you can see so we're looking over the

690
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,059
past seven days here we can actually

691
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:33,720
um

692
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,760
we can say star for risk objects so we

693
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,740
can see all risk objects and all of the

694
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,500
different searches and risk scores that

695
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,700
everybody in your environment has

696
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,500
populated but you can also drill down to

697
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,659
particular risk objects so in this case

698
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,880
you can see that

699
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,220
um over the past seven days we've had an

700
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,720
increase in three different distinct

701
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,340
sources so these are your different Risk

702
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,140
rules

703
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,840
you can see we've actually increased by

704
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,960
one for a unique risk object so this is

705
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,340
interesting

706
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,360
um

707
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,480
and then here you can see we've got

708
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,039
overall

709
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,799
um we can see a trend line for different

710
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,080
Risk rules over time

711
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,260
we have our miter attack annotations

712
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,820
here so we've got

713
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,559
different miter attack tactic and

714
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,299
techniques you can see we've got a large

715
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,360
one in remote Services here

716
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,600
as well as a data transfer size limit

717
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,220
now if you scroll down here we can

718
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,159
actually see some of our most recent

719
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,520
data from our Risk Index

720
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,480
okay thanks

721
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,460
all right so are there any questions

722
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,179
yep

723
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,700
yeah so my my um my suggestion there is

724
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,980
take out all those alerts that you

725
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,320
originally had and just have that miter

726
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,419
attack tactic exceed a certain threshold

727
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,100
or the risk course exceeding a certain

728
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,620
threshold and I've seen like you can you

729
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,960
can set that notable in your incident

730
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,880
review page so when you drop that down

731
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,320
and you look at that you can actually

732
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,679
see all the sub Risk rules in there so

733
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:53,820
it'll show you

734
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,200
um and I can show you afterwards if you

735
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,700
want to come down but it'll show you the

736
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,140
Risk rules that you've triggered it'll

737
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
show you the different miter attack

738
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,620
tactics and techniques and then you can

739
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,720
even drill down so you can just drill

740
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,220
down you know click a hyperlink it'll

741
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,419
take you to your Risk Index and it'll

742
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,140
show you that data

743
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,139
yep appreciate it
