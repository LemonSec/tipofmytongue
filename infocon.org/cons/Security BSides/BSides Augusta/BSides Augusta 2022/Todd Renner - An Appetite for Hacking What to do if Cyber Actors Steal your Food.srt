1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,160
all right good is anyone in farming or

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,839
agriculture

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,640
there's a disproportionate ratio of

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,279
hands going up yeah okay good so keep me

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,660
honest if I say anything that's not

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
accurate

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,439
um I wish I could answer all the

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,580
questions that were supposed to be

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,500
answered in the in the flyer but what

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
what are we going to do if hackers steal

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,260
our food

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,880
did he want to watch the keynote also

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,260
who watched the Keynote

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,780
great great opening I think so many good

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,340
points there

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,719
one of the things I'm not going to do

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,899
today is give you any zero days okay he

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,579
did say they might come up but it's not

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,020
coming up on this one this is going to

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,780
be more fun more thought-provoking I'm

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,219
not going to have many answers on what

22
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,440
to do here but I am going to just talk

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,360
about a couple things that I'm seeing in

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,360
the world today as it relates to cyber

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,340
and Agricultural and food and some of

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,320
the things going on in big events over

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,000
the course of the past few months if

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,559
nothing else

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
I'm a retired FBI agent anyone from the

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,119
government in here that's willing to

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,560
admit it most of the people working the

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,580
government out here aren't willing to

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,840
admit it

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,140
um spent just over 20 years doing uh

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,820
everything from chasing terrorists

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,200
around the world to working in a cyber

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,580
spot and retired out of the Atlanta

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,220
office which had a couple fairly

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,920
significant events recently some of you

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
may have heard of a little pipeline that

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,580
had some ransomware there was also a

42
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,560
credit monitoring system that had a

43
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,060
little bit of issues with the Chinese

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,159
suspected

45
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,700
um

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,380
one of the city governments got hit by

47
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,240
the Iranians we had a few things again

48
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,400
suspected we had a few things go on so

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,799
retired from the FBI after 20 years I

50
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,600
spent about 10 years on our SWAT teams

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,060
so very technical background that I took

52
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,220
into law enforcement and now I'm at FTI

53
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,439
consultant where we do

54
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,479
a myriad of Consulting like all the

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,220
consulting firms do

56
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,899
but in the cyber security space

57
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,479
specifically and after years and years

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
of looking at very specific attributions

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,579
pieces I spent a couple years at NSA up

60
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,439
at Fort Meade for our fellow nsaires

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,258
here thanks for what you do

62
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,239
spent a few years over in London with

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,420
our UK counterparts MI5 and MI6 and with

64
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,980
the intelligence shops there in the law

65
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,080
enforcement side and really took that

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,760
piece of of what I've learned

67
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,379
internationally and domestically and

68
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,599
looking at this sort of threat Spectrum

69
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,099
thought that I used to be able to give

70
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,319
scary speeches until I started working

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
with we have a food and agricultural guy

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,720
at FTI that's a world leader in food and

73
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,580
agricultural threats who knew that was a

74
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,720
thing didn't even know that was a thing

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,280
I didn't know that was a thing I just

76
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,599
thought you show up at Chick-fil-A your

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
Chick-fil-A is ready food's ready you

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,560
drive away the reality is and what I'm

79
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
going to talk about is just some of the

80
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,620
threats that we're seeing really for the

81
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,120
thought provoking try and get a couple

82
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,980
questions answers out of here really

83
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,780
give you something to think about for

84
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,819
like in the previous speech there's

85
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,680
things that you just might it might be

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,720
simple that we could fix things and as

87
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,879
we've seen for anyone have babies it

88
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,319
went through the baby formula crisis

89
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,019
recently it really can affect us in a

90
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,280
way that a lot of people don't think

91
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,040
about on a day-to-day basis so not meant

92
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,780
to scare anyone but really meant to

93
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,080
we'll address one big problem at the end

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,340
I don't want to give away any too much

95
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,900
but I'll address one big problem at the

96
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,220
end

97
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,159
so this came out recently right a real

98
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,360
shooting War

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,459
could come from a cyber breach anyone

100
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,920
surprised to hear that I've been in the

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,659
industry for a long time I started out

102
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,540
in the early 90s uh

103
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,239
not a lot has changed keeping it back to

104
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,819
the simple right and for years for you

105
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,099
especially in the bureau what's going to

106
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,360
be the next cyber threat what's next

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,860
anyone know what the next cyber threat

108
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,080
is if you do that's going to business

109
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,519
together I'll equip my current company

110
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,560
and go in business with you because I

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,940
think we'd all be billionaires if we

112
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,920
knew what the next cyber threat is

113
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
but we don't

114
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,099
um and we're still having those

115
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,780
conversations back and to keep it simple

116
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,180
how many people are very confident that

117
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,040
all of their backups work and all of

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,260
their users have good passwords I mean

119
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,760
it can't get more simple we don't have

120
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,080
to start thinking about the next thing

121
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,879
yet because we still can't get stuff

122
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,459
that should have been fixed in the 80s

123
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,319
right yet so when you see this thing

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,659
like oh man a real shooting war is

125
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,700
coming from cyber it's more than likely

126
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,560
going to end up in what we're seeing and

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,839
what we've known for years anyone heard

128
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,100
of not Petra

129
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,400
okay little a little bit of an issue for

130
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,840
someone that wanted electricity in the

131
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,979
Ukraine before they went to war with

132
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,800
them we've seen this already this isn't

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,660
new but it's still getting press on a

134
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,759
daily basis so our the people that make

135
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,620
decisions in our lives our bosses our

136
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,620
cisos our CEOs our boardrooms are

137
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,759
concerned when they see the president

138
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,320
United States coming out with this and

139
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,300
and probably rightfully so

140
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,460
and we've seen that

141
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,060
so one of the pieces that agriculture

142
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,080
world is how it fuels Ford right anyone

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,820
deal with commodities anyone trade in

144
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,100
Commodities I certainly don't because

145
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,540
it's really really confusing pork

146
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,800
bellies and all the stuff that made it

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,380
out years ago like very very confusing

148
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,440
but what I do know is that having lived

149
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,220
in Europe

150
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,740
a large portion of the the farm and

151
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,479
agriculture comes from Ukraine and

152
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,979
Eastern Europe and it goes back Across

153
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,020
the Western a lot a lot of ours comes

154
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,580
from where where does our agriculture

155
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,320
come from

156
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,340
where

157
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,440
Midwest where else

158
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,540
South America right it comes from all

159
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,720
over the place South America huge right

160
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,520
what happens and I'll give you some

161
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,020
slides from the USDA in just a minute

162
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,660
though the Ukraine controls a lot of

163
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,000
pieces of that agriculture piece for the

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,419
rest of Europe and so I know for for me

165
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,979
anyways a lot of us wouldn't have been

166
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,020
tracking you know we know that Russia

167
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,060
invaded Ukraine and we know that there

168
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,100
was some talks about it and there were

169
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,800
some very specific talks back at the end

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,320
of July about

171
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,720
keep bombing us can you just open up our

172
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,280
ports and for me I'm like man that's a

173
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,900
little bit odd like go ahead you keep

174
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,400
just can you just open up our Port so we

175
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,840
get our grain out but you think about

176
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,580
how the world's agriculture moves around

177
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,500
and the stuff that comes from the

178
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,419
Ukraine that is what I've learned is

179
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,039
because from Ukraine grain goes down

180
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
some of the the fertilizer all that

181
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,460
stuff goes down to South America South

182
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,139
America then fertilizes our crops for

183
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,300
next year next year that food comes up

184
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,580
to American goes throughout the world

185
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,440
the crops from the Ukraine goes across

186
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,300
Europe so what happens if you can't get

187
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,580
that grain out of the Ukraine or places

188
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,840
that are growing those sort of things

189
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,300
and responsible for fertilizer you have

190
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
lots of issues down the road and so this

191
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
was fairly eye-opening or it should be

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
I'll play the video real quick this is

193
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,600
also one of the things from the previous

194
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,060
speaker what to do in your presentations

195
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,240
putting videos in a presentation is much

196
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,039
aligned with doing a live cyber

197
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,259
demonstration in a presentation frowned

198
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,960
upon but I'll try it anyways

199
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,460
and it's not that much of it doesn't

200
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,180
really actually happen

201
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,120
if anyone could translate please do

202
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,979
but this is significant they said all

203
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,060
right Russian said we're going to open

204
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,500
up your grain we're going to open the

205
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,360
ports and as soon as that started

206
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,440
happening they bombed it

207
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,880
fairly big deal and the Russians know

208
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,259
this as well because what do the

209
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,600
Russians have that we all have they have

210
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,919
we have a lot of mouths that have to be

211
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,199
fed so they know about food you know who

212
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,819
else has a lot of mouths to feed that

213
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,800
could be an adversary in our world in

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,500
the cyber world the China oh thank you

215
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,360
look at that that was in unison that was

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,979
almost like we've not prepared for this

217
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,139
the Chinese and they have and we'll go

218
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,699
through a couple slides about that as

219
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,940
well

220
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,180
this is from uh the USDA so you look at

221
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,280
this

222
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
which is a trusted source for me you

223
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,940
look at some of these numbers Ukraine's

224
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,440
run the world's top agricultural

225
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,819
producers did anyone know that before

226
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,880
anyone think about that as a threat to

227
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,979
what we're doing you didn't are you in

228
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,020
agriculture

229
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,699
all right good

230
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,139
I was hoping someone would have

231
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,880
agricultural background like that's Todd

232
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
that's ridiculous that's not true but

233
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,319
you look at these numbers from the USDA

234
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,460
employment for about 15 of the

235
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,560
population

236
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,319
55 of the land is arable I mean this is

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,060
a lot this is a big deal for a country

238
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,880
that's dealing with

239
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,460
threats like not pecha and Russia right

240
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,620
so we get back to the Cyber piece and

241
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,479
I'll keep drawing that back in over and

242
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,919
over again

243
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,240
if you look at some of the stuff we're

244
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
seeing going on in the world also as

245
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,259
with the inflationary pressure and these

246
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,020
slides are from these are from uh our

247
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,900
FTI guys names rich koppmeier

248
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,819
again you give a cyber presentation you

249
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,800
could scare the pants off someone he

250
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,020
gives his presentation on very specific

251
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,140
numbers related to inflationary

252
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,039
Agriculture and food and you're like oh

253
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,958
my God I better start stockpiling does

254
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,640
anyone a prepper that wants to admit to

255
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,559
that

256
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,760
I'll invite you to one of those

257
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,080
presentations you'll start prepping

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
peanut butter by 55 gallon drums of

259
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,339
peanut butter it lasts forever but you

260
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,480
look at some of these threats that are

261
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,860
on here right fertilizer back to the

262
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,300
fertilizer piece

263
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
while we while we think about the wheat

264
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
and the food that's there right now we

265
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,420
have to look at how it affects things

266
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,580
Downstream and how many years is that

267
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,160
going to cause some sort of inflationary

268
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,800
pressure on food products that were seen

269
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,019
in the grocery stores today and how is

270
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,300
that affected by any sort of cyber

271
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,980
threat that could come in directly to

272
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,760
Farmers Grain ports as we just saw

273
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,800
systems that the farmers are using how

274
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,660
does that affect what we're seeing on

275
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,920
our cyber and why does that matter if

276
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,180
we're cyber people why are you talking

277
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,399
to me about farming stuff

278
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,459
well that that's cyber risk it's it's a

279
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,800
risk to Our Food Systems because the

280
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
normal Farmers anyone have family that's

281
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,060
in farming the normal farmer is not just

282
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,160
you know

283
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,899
Jimmy the farmer down the street that's

284
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,700
going to get on his tractor these are

285
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,060
very complex complicated systems now

286
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,560
it's going to put one up about milk does

287
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,940
anyone drink milk

288
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,920
I'd put it up but it would scare you you

289
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,320
wouldn't want to drink milk anymore and

290
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,360
some of the conspiracy theories side of

291
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,580
this is that as we're looking at these

292
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,800
farming systems if I can manipulate one

293
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,779
thing and I'll cover JBS just because

294
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,459
it's obligatory when you're talking

295
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,560
about food and cyber

296
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,779
but if I could manipulate one check and

297
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,000
balance like all right so when all these

298
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
things go through some of these Farming

299
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,839
Supply pieces and you get further up

300
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,940
into the middleware

301
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,620
there's checks and balances to make sure

302
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,180
your fruits and meats and everything are

303
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,480
good they're still they're not rancid

304
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,580
there's no poison in them what if I just

305
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,380
checked again changed that flag from

306
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,660
false to true so yep all true all this

307
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,820
meat is constantly good keeps shipping

308
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,160
it out shipping around the world how

309
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,779
long before someone figures that out is

310
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,300
that how many gastrointestinal issues do

311
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,399
we have before then

312
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,519
so Drive here's my obligatory one JBS we

313
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,620
have to talk about JBS

314
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,480
um not only is it the ransomware piece

315
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
but you look at some of these plants

316
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,839
that were closed around the U.S now

317
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,360
we're dealing with food employment 11

318
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,220
million Ransom anyone in the Cyber

319
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,779
Insurance business

320
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,579
like there you go

321
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,260
did you cover them are you willing to

322
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,420
tell us if you covered them

323
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,040
would your company want to pay out this

324
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,620
Ransom

325
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,060
and what would your premiums be after

326
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,160
you pay out 11 million Ransom like that

327
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,720
the insurance companies are in the

328
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,100
business of making money they're not in

329
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,660
the business of making it easier for us

330
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,880
right so this is

331
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,519
you figure how that happens 11 million

332
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,839
dollars these plants are closed

333
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,880
unemployment and then look where else is

334
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,620
impacted around the world Australia and

335
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,000
Canada and places all over the world

336
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
that are impacted by something that we

337
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,399
simply see in a very good flashy nor

338
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,740
O'Donnell piece 11 million Ransom paid

339
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,839
but all those pieces that fall out along

340
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,940
the lines for the food and agriculture

341
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,640
how much was affected because of a cyber

342
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,579
event that affected our meat Supply okay

343
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,560
if you're a vegetarian but now

344
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,740
uh the rest that aren't I mean those are

345
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,240
massive issues and it's okay if you're a

346
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,500
vegetarian unless your family is

347
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,480
employed in any of those places that are

348
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,220
now affected by a Cyber attack and might

349
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,940
not be getting paid it's a

350
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,279
waterfall effect on so many of these

351
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,060
things

352
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,920
our foreign partners are seeing this as

353
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,260
well this is from BBC cyber security

354
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,079
it's a global food supply chain at risk

355
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,839
of hackers and this is along the lines

356
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,339
of some of the things that you see when

357
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,399
ransomware like JBS and Colonial makes

358
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,279
the big headlines anyone have a boss at

359
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,180
work

360
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,060
anyone's work in the business of making

361
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,140
money

362
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,420
so that company that just might have

363
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,220
lost 11 million dollars are people happy

364
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,720
is your day going to be good like great

365
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,399
good job

366
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,140
systems weren't patched probably didn't

367
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,940
have backups paid out 11 million this

368
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,380
just keep going this is going to be a

369
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,300
fun day we see this over and over again

370
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,579
that the this sort of headline is

371
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,440
affecting us in ways that now it's going

372
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,060
to affect people at their house right

373
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,820
it's affecting food on your table if

374
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,860
it's tied to a Cyber attack it's going

375
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,779
to make your day worse than it started

376
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,040
out

377
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,019
also obligatory I have to put in here

378
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,720
the FBI slides just because I'm proud of

379
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
the work that they've done in this space

380
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,920
they're getting better by the day if you

381
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,360
don't have a relationship with your

382
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,980
local FBI office I would highly

383
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,300
encourage you to make that relationship

384
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
in the Cyber Arena every single one of

385
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,160
the Cyber every single one of the FBI

386
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
offices has a cyber task force that will

387
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
want to talk to you about what you're

388
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,260
doing what you're seeing and how to

389
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,180
collaborate so I'd highly recommend it

390
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,600
and as a result you will get access to

391
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,060
this sort of information as soon as it

392
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,420
comes out

393
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
there's my I didn't get paid for that

394
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,820
that's just free

395
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,620
it used to be easy I'd say I'm here from

396
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,579
the government I'm here to help

397
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,200
but

398
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
these are you look back at the dates on

399
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,060
this September of 21 and then as soon as

400
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,120
you know recently April 2022 you see

401
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,560
that these sort of things are coming out

402
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,120
so

403
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,860
not going to pull this but think about

404
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,519
this inside with your inside voices how

405
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,779
happy are you with what the government

406
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,959
gives you and provides for information

407
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,639
and if they're willing to put this stuff

408
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,440
out it's because they're seeing it and

409
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
they're seeing it at such a pace that it

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,620
has to be shared and this is

411
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,420
specifically talking about food and

412
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,760
agriculture in both places and in

413
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
agricultural co-ops because the

414
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,300
businesses of co-ops and food is huge

415
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,240
one of the biggest uh contributors to

416
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,639
our GDP is food nag

417
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,920
there's food and agricultural protection

418
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,380
centers anyone heard of these people

419
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,660
that are that work on this specifically

420
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,380
not only for DOD but for some of the the

421
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,600
food defense counterparts normally do do

422
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,700
people leave but food protection and

423
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,620
defense this is from University of

424
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,839
Minnesota but there's people out there

425
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,399
that are looking at how to do this

426
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,860
specifically back to interest identify

427
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,240
your interest if this is if you have

428
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,820
some interest in agriculture or food and

429
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,860
cyber man there's such a need for you

430
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,600
and hopefully we'll get that out in this

431
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,579
presentation that there's a need to

432
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,100
stand up this sort of thought process

433
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
and protecting what we all need on a

434
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,040
daily basis

435
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,300
what about this again could be fatal

436
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,360
flaw number two but one more video from

437
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,920
February

438
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,139
major Cyber attack on its institutions

439
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,920
I'll leave it for a second

440
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,559
[Music]

441
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,540
hopefully a little cyber Awards look

442
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,459
like your sock right now just cyber War

443
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,850
left and right

444
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,929
[Music]

445
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,230
[Music]

446
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
um

447
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,459
and so I put that in there one I one of

448
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,720
the things that I do in my presentation

449
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,279
is I pull from a bunch of different news

450
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,320
sources just so that it's not slanted

451
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,699
one way or another I try to make it so

452
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,380
it's not slanted one way or another but

453
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,360
this overlaps with exactly what Biden

454
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,220
said in our first in our first slide

455
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,980
right is that if if our country can't

456
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,899
have some sort of faith in that our

457
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,199
systems are safe and sound and then you

458
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,139
you can't get food and some irrational

459
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,120
decision maker decides to send in troops

460
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
it's a possibility and it's what we're

461
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,300
seeing he talks about being able to pay

462
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,759
for groceries so imagine if a plant gets

463
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,720
hit

464
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,940
there's actually very limited Supply and

465
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,259
then you actually can't pay for it

466
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,579
because those systems are hit too and

467
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,319
your financial systems are hit it's

468
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
really looking at that how that whole

469
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,540
ecosystem of food and cyber and Banking

470
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,459
and all those pieces tied together and

471
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,599
they were seeing it that's what they

472
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,280
were seeing happen to them

473
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,140
so not only they are supplying the food

474
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,760
which they can't get out because the

475
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,740
ports are closed now people can't pay

476
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,199
for the food and it's I think one of the

477
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,520
pieces he says in there is that people

478
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
are going to be afraid that the uh the

479
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,299
government the state's not in control I

480
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,400
think we've already

481
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,919
gone through that here in the U.S and

482
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,480
then one more let's see if this one

483
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,340
works I think this one probably will not

484
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,020
work this one will break

485
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,620
on me

486
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,000
which is okay as well

487
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,400
this was this is one that I had a very

488
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,780
hard time getting to work but is really

489
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,799
talking about

490
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,720
um

491
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,539
Farmland being bought by the Chinese and

492
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,520
specifically talking about a base in

493
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,980
North Dakota that the the Chinese owned

494
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,140
hundreds of millions of of uh heck

495
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,840
takers here in the U.S and there's a

496
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,900
cypheus council of foreign investments

497
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,179
the reviews is supposed to review this

498
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,640
type of investment from foreign

499
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,799
adversaries or foreign parties that

500
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,679
might be a risk to our national security

501
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,500
there in my opinion we really have to be

502
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,059
careful where this Farmland is being

503
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,679
bought up because of foreign Nations

504
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,840
control our Farmland that then control

505
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,299
our food that tie it into our banks that

506
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,039
tie into our ecosystem we have some

507
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,360
massive issues

508
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,059
again USDA tracks what each one of these

509
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,900
countries do you could see corn and if

510
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,340
um if that sypheus video would have

511
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,419
played

512
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,980
you'll see that they're saying that it

513
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,720
was a cornmeal they were buying it so

514
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,460
they could they could grow corn have a

515
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,960
cornmeal in the U.S and North Dakota

516
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,480
just happens to be by one of our more

517
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,580
secretive military bases

518
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,400
um pure happenstance I'm sure who

519
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
doesn't want Farmland in North Dakota

520
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,940
right everyone does especially the

521
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,340
Chinese because clearly they're lacking

522
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,380
their corn production

523
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,940
um

524
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,860
I mean they're they're just basically

525
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,840
starving now the reality is they do have

526
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,760
a billion miles to feed so they have to

527
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,320
grow corn they have to know how to grow

528
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,539
these things because so many of these

529
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,400
things are at the base of what all our

530
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,580
food is produced on but why are they

531
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,620
buying stuff so close to a military base

532
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,480
in North Dakota when look at the numbers

533
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,580
of what they're making

534
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,980
this is like translating gigabytes to

535
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,140
terabytes there's some zeros after that

536
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,720
thirty six thousand it's a lot of land

537
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,780
and a lot of corn they're producing

538
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,640
according to the USDA

539
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,100
um except for North Dakota coin I'm sure

540
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,380
that's going to be a fantastic uh sell

541
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,240
in Wuhan come on

542
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,240
get your North Dakota corn

543
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,919
and we've seen

544
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,480
um through the years we've seen this is

545
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,039
from Monsanto if anyone's heard of

546
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,840
Monsanto a little tiny company here in

547
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
the U.S

548
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,419
this is uh from 2019 where we've seen a

549
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,100
suspected and proven

550
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,380
Chinese spy that was literally stealing

551
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,419
the the agricultural data for tractors

552
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,419
like how to make those move around

553
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,980
who would have thought would anyone

554
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,240
think that that's a threat like my

555
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,100
tractor like that tractor if you drive

556
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,960
around Augusta no offense people in this

557
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,380
part of Georgia we live up in Atlanta

558
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,760
there's tractors and yards like who

559
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
thinks there's going to be a Chinese spy

560
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,580
trying to steal that we've also seen

561
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,900
them and caught them and it's not in

562
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,280
this presentation but you could Google

563
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,679
some of this stuff going out to fields

564
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,539
in Iowa looking for looking for and

565
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,020
stealing genetic seeds companies spend a

566
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,940
lot of money in making sure that the

567
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,559
Watermelons that used to be this big are

568
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,240
now this big and the Watermelons used to

569
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,919
have a lot of seeds now have no seeds

570
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
and corn is all beautiful yellow not the

571
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,780
nasty stuff

572
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,160
the companies spend a lot of money to

573
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,660
make their stuff look like that and how

574
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,120
to grow more and again the Chinese have

575
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,280
a lot of mouth to feed they have to they

576
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,140
want to feed and should feed their

577
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,480
people so if they could just steal this

578
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,160
stuff why

579
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,780
why build it and re-engineer it

580
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,860
themselves

581
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,460
so as an update on this one he did was

582
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,220
found guilty he got two years

583
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,100
and 150 000 fine for stealing Trade

584
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,780
Secrets

585
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,520
um but I mean that who would have

586
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,860
thought about that nutrient Optimizer is

587
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,539
what he was really trying to get has

588
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,840
anyone tried to steal nutrient optimizer

589
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,000
does anyone have any nutrient optimizer

590
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,600
and then back to ransomware this big

591
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,240
Co-op and again the big numbers and the

592
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,700
massive amount of headlines that makes

593
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,100
it and it depends on what your optic is

594
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,260
for us in this room our optic we're

595
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,940
probably all going to immediately go to

596
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,580
oh man ransomware some of us go to black

597
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,820
matter be like oh man those are Russians

598
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,559
very few of us in the world that have

599
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,120
that sort of level of background that's

600
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,159
going to care about black matter and

601
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,140
ransomware will then say man new

602
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,580
Cooperative that's a really important

603
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,140
business for us to be able to feed our

604
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,980
families

605
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,500
does that that doesn't translate in our

606
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,059
world most of the time but I'm I'm

607
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,500
arguing that it probably should we

608
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,480
should start thinking about how all

609
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
these things tie into the ecosystem

610
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,799
um some people are my insurance friend

611
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,179
in the back like oh that one's only six

612
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,919
million thank goodness statement save me

613
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,679
half half of what I had to pay out but

614
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,780
you think about that right this whether

615
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,820
or not it was a targeted attack or not I

616
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,159
don't know but you think about the

617
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,539
effect that these sort of things could

618
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,640
have we've seen it on new cooperative

619
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,820
and JBS we know that it has an effect on

620
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,799
our food supply

621
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,960
and that's before we get into anyone in

622
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,980
crypto

623
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,559
if you have any crypto people okay good

624
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,840
crypto companies or you just have your

625
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,460
wallet and your seed and everything on

626
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,740
your phone

627
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,240
all right

628
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,520
awesome

629
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,580
anyone want to buy a go meet tokens

630
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,320
you can buy them

631
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,480
um I did pull up the uh the places that

632
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,520
deal with go meet here in the Augusta

633
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,520
area they're a niche meet

634
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,400
food delivery

635
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,260
trying to focus on Halal type stuff

636
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,360
pretty interesting but look at they're

637
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,799
they're saying this put this all in the

638
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,679
blockchain this this two use tokens I do

639
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,960
think and this is a little off topic I

640
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,700
do think that we'll see like we saw the

641
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,620
gift card wave happen in the late 90s

642
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,780
and now everyone gives gift cards I do

643
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,059
think at some point there might be

644
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,860
digital assets as far as

645
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,480
if you want to buy something at Best Buy

646
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,100
you have to buy the Best Buy token and

647
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,600
you can use Best Buy tokens and then

648
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,179
they could track everything we'll see

649
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,280
um but they're doing it already with

650
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,140
food they're doing it with our food with

651
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,820
our meat they got they so they could

652
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,500
track the whole production to make sure

653
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,419
things are Halal they could track the

654
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,980
whole thing

655
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,460
pretty ingenious Pig butchering anyone

656
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,080
heard of pig butchering it's not food

657
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,280
related I just thought it was pretty

658
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,440
neat and tied into the presentation I'm

659
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,120
not going to play this presentation this

660
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,340
piece but

661
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,520
Pig butcher all right your fridges who

662
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,039
has a smart fridge iot

663
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,960
no one's going to admit to that now like

664
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
my hands down

665
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,539
um

666
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,140
before I saw the previous presentation

667
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,360
I was going to put this video in has

668
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,460
anyone seen Silicon Valley any episodes

669
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,620
of it not really the most audience

670
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,200
friendly language that goes on in there

671
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,480
or the but if you look at this YouTube

672
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,700
video you can see where they they get

673
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,320
into it over hacking each other's fridge

674
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,780
that scans and then they they go back

675
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,000
and forth of how to hack that fridge but

676
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,220
the reality is when you look at the it

677
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,080
OT threats that are out there anyone in

678
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,360
that world itot manufacturing yeah I

679
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,580
mean the threats are significant do you

680
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,740
guys feel like you're getting all the

681
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,140
funding and backing and skills and

682
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,880
training that you need like everyone's

683
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,159
up to speed now okay that's what and

684
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,240
that's what we're seeing over and over

685
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,620
again if you get back to what that

686
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,720
normal modern farming system looks like

687
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,120
it is itot all over the place and we'll

688
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,039
talk about in just a minute but yeah

689
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,919
your fridge and other devices washing

690
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,200
machines washers and dryers and

691
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,820
microwaves all these things that are

692
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,620
connected to how you deliver your food

693
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
drones

694
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,919
who's a drone operator drone pilot

695
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,720
registered all right

696
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,240
drones in agriculture if you haven't

697
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,220
ever looked at these things fascinating

698
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,419
as well I mean they could deliver

699
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,100
fertilizer they could see crops I'll

700
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,299
show you a picture in just a second of

701
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,520
what what they look at on a on a field

702
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,280
it's fascinating but has anyone seen

703
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,480
hack the drones

704
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,039
or the cameras that are out there that

705
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,659
could control a drone now right or you

706
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:25,559
think about some of the government

707
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,840
capabilities that you could geofence an

708
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,720
area off and know last year I worked the

709
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,760
World Series and we could see if any

710
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,620
drones were in no fly areas and make

711
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,059
them set down so what if you could do

712
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,159
that to the food we just geofence off a

713
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
farm that relies on drones and we don't

714
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,659
want any fertilizer to go there so the

715
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,140
crops die

716
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,340
amazing

717
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,020
I didn't know that was happening so

718
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,120
we're supposed to walk around I did see

719
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,860
a couple people with tin foil

720
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,559
that's over my years I didn't realize

721
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
that was why they knew kovid was coming

722
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,840
before that happened

723
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,240
but you look at back the itot if anyone

724
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,980
had any of these issues who would like

725
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,960
to talk about them feel free to join in

726
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,960
we still have you know 15 20 minutes

727
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,940
um but this is a Snyder Electric piece

728
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,580
plcs and this came out and a lot of this

729
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,500
was very specifically related to the

730
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,799
farming and agriculture Arena these are

731
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,740
things that if you aren't in this world

732
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,140
talking about Nano pocs and and that

733
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,360
sort of terminology or verbiage this

734
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,580
will be much like our boardroom ciso

735
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,820
CEOs I.T people accounts payable you

736
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,380
will shut down immediately you're like

737
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,200
all right none of those things matter

738
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,039
m238 boring shutdown next slide please

739
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,720
these things are critically important to

740
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,520
Agriculture and to our Farmers right now

741
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,799
whether the farmers know it or not

742
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,440
AI is anyone dealing with AI anyone

743
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,419
working in the AI Arena

744
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,220
I mean look at look at this is a picture

745
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,360
I was talking about look at how they're

746
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,740
looking at Fields right they're looking

747
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,919
at a very specific data it's data driven

748
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,140
so if we could start hacking into that

749
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,880
that's another emerging threat that's

750
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,980
out there the risk of AIS and there's

751
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,400
tons of of uh of articles about this out

752
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
there if you are interested in this sort

753
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,299
of world of AI and Agriculture and how

754
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:25,980
that ties together but you think about

755
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,200
it again back to that corn if I have 10

756
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,900
seeds of corn can I make sure that all

757
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,940
10 ears of corn grow out nice and

758
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,220
beautiful white stock you know how how

759
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,740
do I want that to look and if it's 50

760
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,260
grows then I have an issue right 50 of

761
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,700
my product is bad

762
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,760
how can I work on this through Ai and

763
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,000
ways to improve agriculture

764
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,799
and now for the Crux of this as we get

765
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,480
towards uh towards the end of the

766
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,179
presentation onto questions and answers

767
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,400
here's a major concern

768
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,740
bourbon drinkers

769
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,299
there we go finally some audience buy-in

770
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,740
I was going to start with this but I

771
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,080
didn't want to scare anyone so I saved

772
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,740
it towards the end

773
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,580
so

774
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,380
as you're doing presentations animation

775
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,940
don't do them

776
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,880
look at that 51 percent of it some of

777
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,740
you knew this corn

778
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,539
all right what if our corn goes away

779
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,159
whiskey

780
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,940
horrific

781
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,860
potatoes all right that's gonna change

782
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,140
the taste of your of your Bourbon and

783
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,059
now we all think this is a real

784
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,799
important matter before it's like oh

785
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,200
food great I'll be a vegetarian I don't

786
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,179
need JBS

787
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,100
can't be a vegetarian I'll drink bourbon

788
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,919
now now we're in trouble bourbon all

789
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,360
right I heard a couple you say

790
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,520
Alternatives all right good what about

791
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,960
beer they got hacked too look at this

792
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,760
months they had issues

793
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
laughs

794
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,340
good point good point

795
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,200
taken

796
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,440
um yep yeah all the microbrews are just

797
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,000
fine all the ipas you guys are okay

798
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,980
still for now

799
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,600
um as long as you as long as you don't

800
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,700
like Coors or bourbon you're not in

801
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,260
trouble but you think about look at the

802
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,000
the numbers here

803
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
um

804
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,159
just

805
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,320
two million hectoliters that sounds like

806
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,179
a lot I don't know how many cans that is

807
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,179
but it sounds like a lot

808
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:29,340
120 million 140 million ebitda like

809
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,799
that's those numbers who here would be

810
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,480
interested in working if you could take

811
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,539
50 percent of that just uh

812
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,640
help them through that with your cyber

813
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,159
skills right most people if you're not

814
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,720
we could talk to them about just

815
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,220
contract negotiations that's a whole

816
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,840
different presentation that's another

817
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,360
hour some some takeaways that I want you

818
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,440
to have here

819
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,419
the supply chain is vulnerable right

820
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,960
it's it's beyond just showing up in that

821
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,220
Chick-fil-A drive-through and food

822
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,480
getting delivered and everything's good

823
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,360
right we've seen it firsthand recently

824
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,980
within this year we've seen the baby

825
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,919
food issues we've seen JBS hit and

826
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,419
there's enough right now so that we

827
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,100
don't have to worry but what's the down

828
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,200
chain the the downstream effects going

829
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,440
to be of wars and geopolitical issues

830
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,240
and if they know that that's happening

831
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,120
can they attack our systems because they

832
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
know that we're having food issues

833
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Farmers again it's not just you know

834
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,120
Todd the farmer that drives a tractor

835
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,220
anymore just going to get out and so

836
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,860
some hay no the the technology they're

837
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,200
using is everything from drones to AI to

838
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,600
itot all the things that is very

839
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,000
interesting to us is probably very

840
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,740
uninteresting to the people that are

841
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,899
responsible for it we have to be aware

842
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,159
of that

843
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,620
the war in Ukraine is a good example of

844
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,779
what's happening and then the

845
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,000
realization as I've shown you that the

846
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,380
government's care people are out there

847
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,820
thinking about it there are Private

848
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,799
Industry places that are trying to work

849
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,600
on this threat and how can we do this

850
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,179
together with the skill set and brains

851
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,159
that we have in the room to help protect

852
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,779
something that I should have taken a

853
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,760
poll who who eats or drinks in the room

854
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,940
first but I think I got 100 because we

855
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,440
we need this right it's not something

856
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,620
that's just uh a nice thing

857
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,080
I did want to add this in for because

858
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,899
the the title of the presentation is

859
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,179
what can we do any lawyers do we have

860
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,980
lawyers in the in the room

861
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,720
no one's going to admit that like they'd

862
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,520
rather admit crypto or bourbon Drinkers

863
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,140
and be a lawyer

864
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,179
um but in reality in my world in my

865
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,700
experience you we all need our lawyers

866
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,899
on our side when we're dealing with

867
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,260
cyber again in very different world we

868
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,820
will have the best anyone doing an

869
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,380
intrusion response

870
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,020
who's on the Intriguing response side

871
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,460
lawyers always give you the hard drives

872
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,200
and and machines that you actually want

873
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,760
right and need they just oh yeah here

874
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,779
you go I didn't know you wanted this

875
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,000
here you go we need the lawyers on our

876
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
side from the beginning and anything

877
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,779
we're doing in cyber in my opinion in my

878
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,520
experience the more we have them on our

879
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,200
side and have plans approved ahead of

880
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,299
time the better off we are because when

881
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,520
that attack does happen the lawyers will

882
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,080
make the decisions frequently whether or

883
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,340
not you're getting the forensics that

884
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,260
you actually need the logs that you need

885
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,760
the interviews of people that you need

886
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,919
the things that you need make sure you

887
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,960
have communications teams so when you

888
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
are JBS and when things go sideways are

889
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,860
you guys just going to be like oh well

890
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,940
that sucks

891
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,500
um it sucks for my customers my

892
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,500
shareholders my creditors my debtors my

893
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,960
everyone I'm sorry

894
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,820
fact is and we've learned it recently

895
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,320
that you have to have a Communications

896
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,840
team that could be willing to talk to

897
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,539
lots of different people

898
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,520
and different levels of skill sets and

899
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,260
knowledge and care

900
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,179
have your forensic team and your it team

901
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,000
ready and practicing these things it is

902
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,340
back to the basics and I say this like

903
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,320
uh I've probably been saying this for 20

904
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,320
plus years you have to practice this you

905
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,679
have to keep those things simple oh man

906
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,539
wow we're gonna know the ransomware

907
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,220
drill no you do that because you learn

908
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,100
something every single time is a IT team

909
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,080
going to be some experts in the room or

910
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,460
is it going to be Best Buy who are you

911
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,919
going to use FTI Consulting who is it

912
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,000
going to be that you're going to use

913
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,279
know that ahead of time know your

914
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,899
outside vendors and who's going to

915
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,880
provide that assistance if you have

916
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,500
endpoint detection you have seam

917
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,740
Solutions and socks frequently if

918
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,899
anyone's doing all those things from one

919
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:17,460
company alone and one point of contact

920
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,620
more power to you I'd love to hear how

921
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,980
you do that but the reality is no one's

922
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,019
doing that by themselves know who those

923
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:26,340
vendors are know who you're going to

924
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,080
call for assistance immediately because

925
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,880
when your food does disappear you're

926
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,140
going to wonder what happened and you're

927
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,880
not going to know who to call practice

928
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,100
that out and then the these sort of

929
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,840
presentations these sort of conferences

930
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,940
we need to help educate each other I

931
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,679
agree 100 with what the previous speaker

932
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,360
said

933
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,700
we have a glut this is not you know the

934
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,840
number of people that are willing to

935
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,039
come out and talk about this sort of

936
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,260
thing on a Saturday morning I hand it to

937
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,820
you and I thank you guys for doing this

938
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,299
because this is a small subset of

939
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,399
society and everything that we're doing

940
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,140
is moving this direction so we need to

941
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,419
keep educating people from our kids to

942
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,419
our elderly friends and family we have

943
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,740
to help protect them

944
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,440
it's a team sport

945
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,179
collaboration cyber team sport you've

946
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,679
got to build that trust you got to build

947
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,659
those relationships before something

948
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,280
goes sideways figure out who you can

949
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,300
trust

950
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,099
um

951
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,899
you guys in the room have a lot of cyber

952
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,280
skills do you all trust each other right

953
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,440
now probably not

954
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,540
maybe hopefully your co-worker next to

955
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,399
you do otherwise we could also talk

956
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,379
about that afterwards but there's a

957
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,060
complex threats these aren't simple cut

958
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,280
and dry like oh well you just didn't you

959
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,260
didn't turn that switch on these are

960
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,719
very complicated complex threats and I

961
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,639
will leave you this is my contact

962
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,399
information also could be a fatal flaw

963
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,899
on a presentation actually giving out

964
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,480
contact information but something as

965
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,639
you're learning to do presentations

966
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,359
um

967
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,800
decide whether or not you want to put

968
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,060
that on there

969
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,639
with that

970
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,440
am I asking the questions are they

971
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,300
asking the questions I'm asking the

972
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,680
questions oh wow

973
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,740
a trivia question

974
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,320
all right

975
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,760
let's go with good questions yes

976
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,180
yeah yeah good

977
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,099
great question so the question was you

978
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,480
know where do I see this in a priority

979
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,839
right of you know top one through ten

980
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,940
because resources are finite we have to

981
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,980
be able to address things that you

982
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,359
clearly want to go to work and get paid

983
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:44,700
tomorrow what do I have to address first

984
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,260
um I would say this this should be a

985
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,300
high priority but my guess is there

986
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
aren't enough people in the space

987
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,540
looking at this to make sure that things

988
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,000
don't happen and I think as long as low

989
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,920
light low hanging fruit like ransomware

990
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,859
keeps happening that'll start bringing

991
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,839
attention but I think that community

992
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,900
that segment of the world will probably

993
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,460
not put it high on their priority list

994
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,260
for some period of time right because

995
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,060
you think about the burn and churn of

996
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,280
farming Community as a whole and then

997
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,900
getting that processed and then getting

998
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,579
that delivered there's so many pieces of

999
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,800
that supply chain that are a threat and

1000
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
you could do this as a supply chain

1001
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,880
threat presentation it just happens to

1002
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,220
be focused on Ag and so then do you

1003
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,079
focus on supply chain

1004
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,700
um so great question

1005
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,440
um does that one qualify for a good good

1006
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,780
question I I have to judge whether or

1007
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,500
not all right lock picking or a

1008
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,020
USBC Wi-Fi adapter

1009
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,400
all right

1010
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,260
thank you

1011
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,579
all right yes sir

1012
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,440
I sure can

1013
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,079
I'll try and go past this Bourbon One

1014
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,480
real quick don't want to scare anyone

1015
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,800
there you go

1016
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,780
um this is from sisa it's on their

1017
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,980
website

1018
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,500
we're down here

1019
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,359
um I know is it related to apt-20

1020
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,520
all right any other questions

1021
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,400
no come on come on there we go

1022
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,980
yeah the question is where do I see

1023
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,200
people training to protect itot systems

1024
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,280
right

1025
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,619
um I am grid certified and this is I'm

1026
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,359
not paid by them or anything but by sand

1027
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,820
I thought their their training class was

1028
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,040
great there's it's so hard to train in

1029
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,380
unless you get a little PLC box to play

1030
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,060
with not that this is PLC I'm just

1031
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,740
holding it up because this is the size

1032
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,079
of some of the trainers but those are

1033
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,920
fun

1034
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,599
but not if you don't like it right you

1035
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,099
see this sort of thing you're like oh

1036
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,720
man that's a lot of numbers and letters

1037
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,079
that don't make sense and so it's hard

1038
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,339
to practice it it's hard to train it

1039
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,480
that's a good question is anyone else

1040
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,240
saying a place that itot training is

1041
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,078
happening that's good

1042
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,119
yeah great great point right it's a it's

1043
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,780
a different world would you like a USBC

1044
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,400
thank you um it is a different world

1045
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,680
right this is a where does cyber

1046
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,079
security blend with the itot automation

1047
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,119
piece and and how do you actually get

1048
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,500
that training

1049
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,060
um when you start digging into it at

1050
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,099
least my experiences it does get back to

1051
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,800
more cybery stuff but being able to dig

1052
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,119
into it that's the hard part

1053
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,560
understanding how they all tie together

1054
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,540
where they tie together and what's

1055
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,279
important that that's hard

1056
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,300
yeah yeah so Sans and DHS and

1057
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,460
interestingly enough one of the sands

1058
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,440
instructors who's no longer with DHS

1059
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,320
used to lead their ICS scada incident

1060
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,940
response so

1061
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,300
Mark christone he was very good yes sir

1062
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,380
great question the threshold for

1063
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,060
involving law enforcement if your client

1064
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,700
or friend or family has been hacked I

1065
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,920
would keep it very low if you have that

1066
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,359
relationship with whether you wanted to

1067
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,400
be FBI or Secret Service or DHS or

1068
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,720
whoever your point of contact is

1069
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,339
wherever you're at

1070
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,800
um I would keep it low just there's at

1071
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,540
least in my experience and I am biased

1072
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,820
there's not a single cyber Squad out

1073
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,900
there that doesn't want to hear what you

1074
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,119
have to say and you could say this you

1075
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,560
know hypothetically

1076
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,040
company X might have suffered this what

1077
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,839
do you think does this matter do you

1078
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,640
want to investigate it and doesn't mean

1079
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,280
that they won't

1080
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,480
necessarily take it and give you

1081
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,300
something back but they will take it and

1082
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,339
see if it ties in anything bigger and

1083
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,780
then decide if that needs to be

1084
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,460
addressed

1085
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,619
but I would keep it low I mean obviously

1086
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,420
if your Amazon password gets stolen

1087
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,820
probably not but if it is a company

1088
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,980
that's going through some sort of breach

1089
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,619
yeah I'd keep it though I say that now

1090
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,760
because I don't take the call anymore

1091
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,540
that's right absolutely

1092
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,320
anymore or it's time for a hallway con

1093
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,220
yes sir

1094
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,220
what would you say the

1095
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,180
ratio was

1096
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,280
covered versus no cover at all yeah

1097
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,780
that's a great question do you guys hear

1098
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,400
the question who has the right amount of

1099
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,900
insurance coverage right what what's my

1100
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,060
experience now now that I've seen both

1101
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,619
sides I've seen the government side and

1102
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:12,660
now the Consulting side what they tell

1103
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,160
us in the government side was nowhere

1104
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,079
near all the stuff that you learn in the

1105
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,960
in the industry side and so I didn't see

1106
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,760
very much of what happened other than

1107
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,160
can you recover my money from the

1108
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,839
government side now on the corporate

1109
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,900
side I do see that places probably

1110
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,000
aren't reading their writers completely

1111
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,920
and that they probably need more

1112
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,119
coverage than they actually have

1113
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,000
probably not far off from auto insurance

1114
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,060
or some other insurance pieces but I do

1115
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,400
see that I feel like the insurance world

1116
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,599
is working

1117
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,079
better at making sure that the premiums

1118
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,240
and payouts are being communicated more

1119
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,359
from my my experience what's yours

1120
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,200
The Experience basically is not enough

1121
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,540
companies understand how serious

1122
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
um

1123
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,859
what yeah

1124
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,400
the renewals that we're looking at the

1125
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,200
policies were placing are you know

1126
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,040
100 increase of their super

1127
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,819
dead

1128
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,680
the insurance

1129
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,780
can keep up

1130
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,859
the new ways that they're

1131
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,579
agreed and I think it's going to be a

1132
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,260
fascinating space to watch and the same

1133
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,819
thing you see it now down in Florida now

1134
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,680
with Ian right how's that going to

1135
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,119
affect the hurricane insurance down

1136
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,339
there you have these massive payouts

1137
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,200
companies have to keep up they want to

1138
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,160
protect you

1139
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,200
but they have to keep up

1140
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,520
how are they going to do that it's going

1141
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,200
to be an interesting space you think

1142
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,160
we'll move to some sort of

1143
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,720
government-backed cyber

1144
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,359
insurance

1145
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,140
right thank you yes yeah the biggest

1146
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,460
segue in that we'll be here until

1147
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,200
sometime tomorrow for those of you like

1148
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,119
to stay

1149
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,380
thank you for your time thanks for

1150
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,060
listening hopefully just a couple

1151
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,890
thoughts came out of this thank you

1152
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,290
[Applause]
