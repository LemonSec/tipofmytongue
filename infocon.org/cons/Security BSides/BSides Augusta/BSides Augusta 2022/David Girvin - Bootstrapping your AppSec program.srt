1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,740
I must have scared half of you guys out

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,179
of here I'm sorry

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,880
hello everybody way in the back

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
how's it going all right so who am I uh

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,840
I'm David girvin I shouldn't be in Tech

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,240
people made mistakes I ended up here I'm

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,220
really not understand a background as a

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,080
ship captain and an engineer and stupid

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,260
things like that but somehow I hacked my

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,480
way into Tech and I've worked for some

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,340
companies like one password and we act

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,760
purple and bit Discovery and now I am a

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
senior product engineer

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,680
product security engineer of

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,180
architecture I don't know I have some

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,379
stupid titles I don't really care about

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,140
but it works

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,539
so I have a very different view on how

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,360
these things should be and I think one

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,640
of my values in the industry is I see

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,280
when things suck so I'll be pointing out

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,719
things that suck and making fun of

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,580
everybody in different places if you're

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,920
in sales I'm already sorry because I

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,220
make fun of you a lot but those are my

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,840
kids and my wife who are way too good

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,600
for me and yeah some other weird things

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,159
in there I don't need to read them all

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,880
right okay okay what are we going to

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,720
talk about

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,280
uh we're going to outline building an

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
appsec program uh with a different

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,820
perspective on management integration

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll go over the cool tool stuff and

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,320
Technical stlc and all that kind of

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,880
stuff that you need to like have in

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
place but everybody talks about that

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
stuff right it's not a big deal you can

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,500
like look up any of Tanya Jenkins stuff

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,119
and there's a million things on like how

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
to set up your tooling and everything

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,780
but I'm more interested in Social

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,420
Engineering uh for good I used to do it

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,820
for bad now we do it for good uh I'm not

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,560
one of those like I went to college and

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,240
was a good person I was a crappy person

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,220
and very good at sneaking into places

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,600
and figuring these kind of things out

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,060
and went the other direction now I try

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,340
to do it for good uh I have some

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,799
interesting thoughts appsec is sales if

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,200
you suck at sales you suck at appsec so

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,759
these are like skills we can all learn

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,459
and think differently being a part of a

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,099
team is super important to me and uh

56
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,500
everything I failed at which is a lot of

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,340
things so I I'm uh grossly incompetent

58
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,200
um warning Concepts and thoughts are

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,540
based on anecdotal experiences from

60
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,099
building application Security Programs

61
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,780
at places like one password and all

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,300
these other fancy companies uh if you

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,980
disagree with it it's perfectly fine if

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,360
you need to email me and complain about

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
my talk or any views I have that is my

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
email address

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,060
um if you find me abrasive and sarcastic

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,660
but somewhat Charming you are correct so

69
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,920
and if you hang toilet paper over the

70
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,319
back of the roll please leave now you're

71
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,360
not welcome in this talk because you're

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,640
a psychopath so what can we think about

73
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,040
here syllabus this is what we're going

74
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,360
to run through I don't need to read all

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,160
this stuff right but um these are things

76
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,780
that and you can grab my uh slides uh

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,920
just hit me up on LinkedIn or whatever

78
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,360
or maybe we'll put it on the website I

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
don't know how besides Augusta works but

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,140
um I have a bunch of this stuff in here

81
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,180
and these are great blueprints like when

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,379
you're thinking about it it just doesn't

83
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,120
go for just appsec I use this for

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,980
everything because I build Out programs

85
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,379
teams at our company I love hiring and

86
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,000
that kind of stuff too so

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,940
okay what is appsec application security

88
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,340
or product security is a team program

89
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,680
designed to protect all of your code you

90
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,900
own that means everybody that has code

91
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
should have an appsec team no matter how

92
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,620
small the company you know unless you

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,860
like Farm it out which is fine too

94
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,959
um that includes the code your engineers

95
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,640
write as well as third party party

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
libraries and open source tools you use

97
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,519
yes if you hack together a bunch of crap

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,739
using every third party Library known to

99
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,659
man you are still responsible for that

100
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,239
it's also tools that you use you know

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,379
you're running all these open source

102
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,239
tools there's vulnerability in there you

103
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,700
are responsible

104
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,840
it's a strong relationship with

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,060
engineering and sea level stakeholders I

106
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,459
know I look like a cartoon and someone

107
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,080
who does not speak well I've spent most

108
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,519
of my life chasing surf around the world

109
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,860
I'm not like a normal human and I can

110
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,900
still speak to the sea level every day

111
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,080
and do it's internal sales you are

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,580
selling to your engineering team because

113
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,680
they don't like you because you're the

114
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
 who said your code sucks now

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,978
you got to fix it and they said I spent

116
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,959
seven months building it that specific

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,779
way because I thought it was right

118
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,400
that's a big hurdle to get over

119
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,620
uh we'll go through that don't worry uh

120
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,500
it's a smart use of tools and testing uh

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,320
I should have like bolded smart there

122
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,660
because everybody throws every tool they

123
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,280
can find especially open source ones

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,020
that stuff and that's not really the way

125
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,060
to go it's an understanding that if

126
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,680
business doesn't flow there's no product

127
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,199
secure this is a huge issue in appsec

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,419
and we're starting to like mature in a

129
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,500
way that's really interesting and we're

130
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,060
seeing that we are actually a part of

131
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,979
the business if we don't produce profit

132
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,380
we do not get paid so we can't just

133
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,139
roadblock everybody we have to like

134
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,660
relax a little bit I can't just push our

135
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,120
glasses up and scream

136
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,759
it's not old school grumpy gatekeeping

137
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,639
if you're that guy stop it no one likes

138
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,500
you at all especially people like me who

139
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,360
come from outside the industry I worked

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,220
in construction for years on the

141
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
engineering side of things those guys

142
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,580
exist there too and no one liked them

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,520
there either it's not dumping a thousand

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,220
volumes on engineering and saying fix it

145
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,220
this is I I do Consulting with my

146
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,840
company with it's called honey badger

147
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,460
engineering for a reason because it's

148
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,340
just ridiculous but anytime I get caught

149
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,660
into Consulting that's happened they

150
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,919
started an abstract program they said

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,479
screw you I ran sassed uh yelling when

152
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,100
someone something can't get fixed right

153
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,080
away you have to be the nicest person in

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,759
the world or at least be sarcastic

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
enough to convince people that you're

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,000
nice

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
building a wall and starting a war with

158
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
engineering that is how you ruin a

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,160
program immediately and I've picked up

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,660
the pieces from multiple people who

161
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,400
started it that way because they were

162
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,320
way better at appsec than me but they

163
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,240
weren't good at this side

164
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,460
why spend money here yeah there's a lot

165
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,280
of memes I'm like 12. so uh I'm really

166
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,220
older than I look but uh 2020 the

167
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,840
average cost of business affected by a

168
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,060
data breach the United States is 8.64

169
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,259
million

170
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,120
that's a lot of money especially since

171
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,919
half of cyber security companies in my

172
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,259
opinion are vaporware and they're put up

173
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,699
by VC companies they're just trying to

174
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,400
get absorbed so if you if you lose money

175
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
and you don't make money guess what

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,600
you're doubles suck so reputational

177
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,240
damage can be far worse than uh the

178
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,800
original dollar lost

179
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,900
I am huge on this so I threat model

180
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
companies a lot of the times and do SWOT

181
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,740
analysis for their space because I have

182
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,900
a nerd on the side for business which is

183
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,020
very opposite but my day job is very

184
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,400
nerdy but I nerd out on like how

185
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,120
business works and like you know uh

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,160
the two big companies I've worked for

187
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,780
which was one password in Red Canary I

188
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,020
told both of them their biggest

189
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,080
fear shouldn't be the data actually lost

190
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,479
which would suck I mean obviously it's

191
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,600
if anybody ever lost trust with them

192
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,039
um because people trust their password

193
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,919
manager and they really trust Canary

194
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,479
they literally have all of your

195
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,819
Telemetry from every single endpoint you

196
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,979
have in your company so

197
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,720
um it's a different kind of way to start

198
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,100
thinking about it

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,840
um it's estimated that we lose 250 to

200
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,300
600 billion dollars of intellectual

201
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,699
property being stolen every year that's

202
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,500
why you go to China and you see all the

203
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,620
BMWs but they're not BMWs and they weigh

204
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,259
like 6 000 pounds it's very strange

205
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,560
um hopefully your insurance mandates it

206
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
I know insurance is a bad word but it

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,340
needs to it needs we need it for policy

208
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,560
and Regulation and stuff not in the real

209
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,080
world but in cyber security uh it's not

210
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,319
2004 and you're a damn adult that's my

211
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,280
favorite line in this whole thing

212
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,380
because I keep telling myself that every

213
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,300
morning in the mirror I try to tell

214
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,099
myself that

215
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,060
all right first one let's go over hiring

216
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,300
controversial take soft skills are more

217
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,880
than important than being a Smee I know

218
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,740
this is really weird I know I exactly

219
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,599
it just uh if you didn't hear the the

220
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,240
breath on the recording it was there

221
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,759
um hot takes are so hot right now

222
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,500
if you're a jerk nothing will get done

223
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,139
at knapsec this is not pin testing I

224
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,699
love pin testing I'm an offensive

225
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,560
security guy if I could just break crap

226
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,539
and laugh all day I would I mean it'd

227
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,280
just be amazing but that's not the

228
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,340
reality your first hire in my opinion oh

229
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,080
this is my opinion right it's I'm full

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,539
of crap anyway so uh 50 50 mix of

231
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,860
amazing soft skills and application

232
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,559
security if you can find that one guy or

233
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,320
lady or whoever is going to be

234
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,279
um

235
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,719
I don't want to tell your principal

236
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,940
engineer but whatever everybody needs

237
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,219
someone that's going to Mentor well you

238
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,980
need that person to be balanced uh if

239
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,600
they're just super technical but they

240
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,920
suck at talking to people they will not

241
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,140
Mentor well I promise you and if they're

242
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,120
not technical enough but they're really

243
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,500
friendly

244
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,060
well then they're going to look stupid

245
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,380
in a meeting at some point if they're

246
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,080
the upper range of people I've been that

247
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,140
person multiple times

248
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,580
high level of understanding of apps

249
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,860
that's okay you know around the people

250
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,180
that I work with I work with some of the

251
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,380
best engineers in my opinion in the

252
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,839
world I would say that I'm non-technical

253
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm obviously technical I code and I

254
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,339
break and all that kind of stuff but I

255
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,320
am Matt Graber is one of my colleagues I

256
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,480
am not sitting there finding new dll

257
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,760
injections from Microsoft before they

258
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
hit the market and that kind of stuff

259
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
um

260
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,260
but

261
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,959
you know it's I have a very good

262
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,700
overarching understanding of how

263
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,100
security works because I'm a bad guy and

264
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,220
uh and I loved that part of it

265
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,360
um you don't need 10 years of Dev

266
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,580
experience stop trying to find the

267
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,220
Unicorn everybody wraps Up's like I want

268
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,399
to get that senior web engineer who fell

269
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,100
in love with security and works 10 hours

270
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,320
a day and then studies for four hours a

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
night and never talks to their family

272
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,800
that's the guy that I want and I wanted

273
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,240
to do it for a hundred thousand dollars

274
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,360
a year that person does not exist and if

275
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,459
you do find him guess what someone like

276
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,140
dragos or someone else is going to grab

277
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,339
him and pay him a quarter million

278
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,279
dollars a year and you're like dang it

279
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,959
so don't look for that

280
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,339
um you need to find people from

281
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,080
everywhere you need to find good Bridge

282
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,440
Builders this is a huge huge huge deal

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,899
it's such a hard skill to find it's very

284
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,519
easy to burn Bridges

285
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,040
uh but you need to look for that in your

286
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,080
interview process and and

287
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,540
you know I'm the uh extrovert that

288
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,920
adopts all the introverts in my company

289
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm like quarterly hackathons we all

290
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,180
meet up in Denver I take everybody that

291
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,740
doesn't have friends basically they have

292
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,720
friends but not in the office right and

293
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,060
I take them to the bar and buy them

294
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,440
steak and make them get drunk and talk

295
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,440
to people and um that's also kind of

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,980
like how I pair up people on my team if

297
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,240
you get someone who's just this awesome

298
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
software developer and they want their

299
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
soft skills to work you need to buddy

300
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,740
that person up with someone who's going

301
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,240
to let them grow and they'll grow them

302
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,579
too I mean I have a guy who's wrote half

303
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,620
the code for simgrip on my team now I'm

304
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,019
very thankful I stole him but he helps

305
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,700
me with my like deeper python

306
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,620
understanding and I help him not tell

307
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,660
Engineers they're stupid it's like it's

308
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,519
a mutual relationship and it's wonderful

309
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,500
and we're good buddies if you just

310
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
walked in I'm super sarcastic I don't

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
really call my Engineers stupid they're

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,700
way smarter than me

313
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,360
um

314
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
appsec has insane salaries you probably

315
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,860
can't afford it if you can then build a

316
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,140
better team than me and and do the talk

317
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,360
like right like I wish I could just pay

318
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
everybody a quarter million dollars

319
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,440
uh and this is just a plug for me funny

320
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,760
sarcastic people can be great bridge

321
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,440
Builders we work primarily with

322
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Engineers it's a different audience than

323
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
traditional infosec

324
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,980
and that's really true GRC people

325
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,260
corpsec people in my opinion you want a

326
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,760
different personality type

327
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,380
there are more of the disciplinarians

328
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,880
and in reality because they have to be

329
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
they can enforce those things you know

330
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,120
if you're downloading some sort of

331
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,160
malware porn thing on your on your

332
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,660
workbox then you should be told you're

333
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,180
being stupid right like that's NADA but

334
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,500
you know if you're dealing with super

335
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,180
smart engineers and you're like I just

336
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,500
don't think we should use that Library

337
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,140
you shouldn't be forceful you need to

338
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,060
learn you know it's a different it's a

339
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,519
different vibe

340
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,820
yes that is literally I have a baby

341
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,320
about that old I think she made that

342
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
face to me earlier

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
um and I never noticed that so hiring uh

344
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,940
posing view hire Rockstar security

345
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,940
developers fixed all the bad code so I

346
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,160
have friends like Jim manicode and and

347
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,720
all these like super famous abstract

348
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,100
people who are all developers and

349
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,220
they're like no we don't need appsec

350
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,680
teams we need real security developers

351
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,180
and they go in there and they fix

352
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,380
everything for everybody and that's

353
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,899
their job and I'm like well one if you

354
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,640
get a really deep code set like we have

355
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,880
uh you're not gonna unless you're in

356
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,380
that deep every day you have no idea

357
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,180
what's going on there you know people

358
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,579
should write notes in their code they

359
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,899
don't so no one knows what's going on

360
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,040
you're just trying to figure things out

361
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,240
and you don't have time for that but two

362
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
that does not scale at all

363
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,800
um so even if you can find them it's

364
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,440
very hard there's not enough of them

365
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,360
so it will never scale like that's great

366
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
when you have 100 people right what

367
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,660
about when you have ten thousand and

368
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,760
eight thousand of them are developers I

369
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,380
mean we have to be able to scale at

370
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,660
appsec or you end up like all the other

371
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,800
companies that get breached because they

372
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,500
don't have web security right

373
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,899
um what else do I write here I forgot

374
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,420
they can easily uh become a block for

375
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,860
engineering I see that all the time

376
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,019
because it becomes schmee versus me it's

377
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,459
like I'm smarter than you and I'm

378
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,079
smarter than you and everybody's so

379
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,940
smart and then nothing gets done and

380
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,680
then everybody's like I don't talk with

381
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480
that team now because they're dick heads

382
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,579
like that's your biggest fear that's how

383
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,959
you should go into appsec it's like we

384
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,160
don't want we want to be the cool guys

385
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,620
okay so this is a big deal for me uh

386
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,860
leadership I'm really really really

387
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,260
passionate about leadership because

388
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,540
from coming from multiple Industries and

389
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,820
coming into into a leadership position

390
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,680
in security kind of right off the bat

391
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,380
and being in Tech

392
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,920
uh leadership sucks especially in

393
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,260
security and I have some great friends

394
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,880
of mine I've had some hard conversations

395
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
with because I see how they lead their

396
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,480
teams and not at our company like we're

397
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,899
just friends and I'm like you're a dick

398
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,399
like don't do that like you need to

399
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,899
change things and they don't even get it

400
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,639
you know a lot of people were just

401
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,959
really good at what they did and they

402
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,639
got put into leadership and that's not

403
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,260
necessarily the best skill set for that

404
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,639
so

405
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,660
um

406
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,760
this is where many teams fail good

407
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
security person isn't necessarily a good

408
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
team leader if your team leader doesn't

409
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
genuinely care about the individual's

410
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,060
success as well as the teams you get

411
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,980
shitty middle management and there's so

412
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
much

413
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,740
as far as the eyes can see that's the

414
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,800
meme I should put there but uh man so

415
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,100
don't ever forget that you can your HR

416
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,959
team which is this is their job and they

417
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,959
forget this needs to build out paths to

418
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,060
success for individual contributors and

419
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,260
people leaders

420
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,779
such a big deal like if someone can't

421
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,940
get to principal and make great money

422
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,100
the only way to make good money is to go

423
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,600
into the leadership and people leading

424
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,980
but they suck at people leading guess

425
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,160
what everybody suffers for that so

426
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,260
you know have hard conversations with uh

427
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,699
HR people about this kind of stuff

428
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,019
because it's important especially if you

429
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,519
want to retain talent because Talent

430
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,639
will leave in a heartbeat

431
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,920
so my things servant-minded leadership

432
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,019
this means your customer focused team

433
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,300
you're leading your team so they're your

434
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,339
customer so you're customer focused all

435
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,959
the time

436
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,279
um you're actually focused on your team

437
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,500
members success and leading from the

438
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,420
front doing the work you're the block

439
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,699
person you're not throwing your team

440
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,680
under the bus you know if your team

441
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,480
screws up you take the hit

442
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,519
it's hard stuff you know it's it's

443
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,320
really it's really difficult to get your

444
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,459
brain around that stuff sometimes

445
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,720
especially when they do something really

446
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,620
stupid but um you know everybody around

447
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,660
me was like and I'm not even the

448
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,100
director right now at our company I'm

449
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,260
actually like some weird shitty middle

450
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,639
management thing

451
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,160
um but I care about all the guys on my

452
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,440
team I guess I'm the that the lead

453
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,060
engineer or something it's like when we

454
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,440
have one-on-ones I'm actually asking

455
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,760
them like hey dude what do you want to

456
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,320
do like where what what's going to be

457
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,820
interesting where do you want to go with

458
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,440
your career how can I help you with that

459
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,699
and even if it means them going

460
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,800
somewhere else you know

461
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,420
um these are real people you know it's

462
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,860
not just about you and the company and

463
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,959
it's it's a but when you do that and

464
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,300
people see the sincerity of it they bust

465
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,100
their ass for you not only do that but

466
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,420
they do better work they feel more

467
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,459
comfortable and there's not this like I

468
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,199
have to get over this person on the team

469
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,760
and I have to be better than them and

470
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,800
blah blah blah it cuts all that crap out

471
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,779
we have a very honest company I just

472
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,660
turned on a giant pay raise to leave my

473
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,519
company and go do a CSO job somewhere

474
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,259
else and I won't because there's such

475
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,940
good leadership there right now so it's

476
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,860
trickle down

477
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,579
um

478
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,800
humility and honesty uh makes up for not

479
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,540
knowing everything gives team the chance

480
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,660
to shine yeah oh man if you can lead

481
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,579
from the front with I don't know that

482
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,139
does anybody else know the answer to

483
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,060
this I don't want to make the wrong

484
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,040
decision here and you give someone else

485
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,800
a chance to step up and like show that

486
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,540
they knew something there it's such a

487
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,040
big boost especially for younger

488
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,099
Engineers you got guys in their 20s uh

489
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,359
that means the world I've actually had

490
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,859
guys slack me after meetings and be like

491
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,480

495
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,559
said I don't know

496
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959

um honest visibility be open where

499
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,439
you're crushing it where you need help

500
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,340
such a big deal we have a very very my

501
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,620
team is very mean uh in a loving way

502
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,540
we're all actually tight we make fun of

503
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,460
each other constantly but we're also

504
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,919
incredibly honest with everything uh

505
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,299
when we know we suck at something we're

506
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,559
just open about it because we don't

507
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,940
worry about getting fired because we're

508
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,140
all tight we're not trying to throw each

509
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,460
other the bus

510
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,740
um like when it comes to like some of my

511
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,419
code I'm like my code is trash please

512
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:49,980
don't look at that you can go fix it I'm

513
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,260
gonna go run a tool and like make some

514
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,299
speech somewhere and then we'll be good

515
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,700
you know and they know that

516
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,440
um taking responsibility for your

517
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,140
failures and learn to care about other

518
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,080
people which is so difficult

519
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,660
have you guys met people

520
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,600
have you ever driven a car

521
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,640
people suck

522
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,400
and you have to somehow care about them

523
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,880
every day as the boss that is so hard to

524
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,480
do like just driving from from Rome

525
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,340
because we were evacuated by families

526
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,500
were from Florida stay at my buddy's

527
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,760
house to drive over here to do this talk

528
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,860
today I'm like I have my kids in the

529
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,600
back and I'm like trying to hold it

530
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
together like I'm gonna murder half the

531
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,440
people on this road because people are

532
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,000
driving like idiots and like I have the

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,980
kids in the car and then I like always

534
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,780
think about this and I'm like these are

535
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,880
people the real people somehow have to

536
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,380
care about them I don't know how to do

537
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,600
that right now but when it comes to your

538
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
team you know people are going to be

539
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,400
butts and you just somehow have to be

540
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
like okay well I'm bleeding and this is

541
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,140
servant minded leadership which is

542
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,940
I'm just going to kind of figure out how

543
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,260
to make your life better it's where you

544
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,520
stop being a butt and I'm gonna tell you

545
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
you're a butt so that's an important

546
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,460
part of it too it's that Honesty part

547
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
this guy haunts my dreams because the

548
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
first actually both companies that came

549
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,860
in there was this guy

550
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,900
and this guy burned so many damn Bridges

551
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,840
I have bought so many beers so many

552
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,539
dinners had to talk about the stupidest

553
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,520
thing why are some people into small

554
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,440
dogs I don't want to hear about your dog

555
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,960
but I will do this if I can build a

556
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,179
bridge between you and my team to make

557
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,740
sure this happens and then I have

558
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,440
fantasies of kicking your small dog

559
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,480
um sorry German Shepherd guy I just this

560
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,820
is my life

561
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,140
every company will be different but

562
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,020
here's how I try to place us

563
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,419
um as appsec team we view our position

564
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,299
as internal sales customer service a

565
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,740
hundred percent similar to like modern

566
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,620
I.T programs if you're IT company or

567
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,679
like your it team does not see itself as

568
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,840
internal sales to the rest of the

569
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,460
company you need to go grab that

570
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,260
director and be like you're 10 years

571
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,679
behind this is how we do things now have

572
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,660
good customer service

573
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,960
um it's a a really weird thing we touch

574
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,000
sea level that sounds gross I'm going to

575
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,220
change that product managers Engineers

576
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,700
managers I.T and sales and GRC

577
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,280
I work with those people weekly that

578
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,720
sounds insane right you think I should

579
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,220
just be like hacking code all day and

580
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,600
running burp Suite until my fingers

581
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,200
bleed but um no it's like we can produce

582
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,179
a massive amount of value like we know

583
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,220
vulnerabilities better than most people

584
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,760
we can actually portray risk better than

585
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,919
GRC can because we see the actual

586
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,539
technical side of it as opposed to I

587
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,980
mean there's technical GRC people but

588
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,240
most of them are more compliance right

589
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,780
so this is how you build that value this

590
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,220
is how we become one of the most

591
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,260
important teams because we're one of the

592
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,000
most expensive teams in a company when

593
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,620
you start building it out

594
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,320
uh I do want my team to be loved by the

595
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
company it's really important for me my

596
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,620
team is rock stars at our company like

597
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,660
really like people when we fly into

598
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,340
Denver everybody gets together people

599
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,860
want to go out uh and hang out with a

600
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,080
bar with us and last time we went to

601
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,600
like open mic night and uh went and saw

602
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,860
a comedy show stand-up show together

603
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,539
took a bunch of the people from the

604
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,580
company it's important I want people to

605
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,960
think of us that way because it that's

606
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,299
how you get stuff done uh we should add

607
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,100
value to security and everything we

608
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,380
touch and that's a really big thing if

609
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,539
you're not actually adding value you

610
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:22,500
know you can tell I have a business

611
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,120
background if you're not adding value

612
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,000
you are not valuable oh that's a hard

613
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,559
one to get around when you think like

614
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm just fixing stuff

615
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,059
no you're just wasting money now if it's

616
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,220
actually not valuable stuff so you got

617
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,799
to be real poignant on on how you look

618
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,620
at all those things yes this is my world

619
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
I'm a threat modeler because I am a

620
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,840
criminal so I know how to think this way

621
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,340
and other people like that's a great

622
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,659
skill set I'm like this is just because

623
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:52,260
my brain's broken so uh

624
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,840
absec path the normal one is always a

625
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,120
good tool run tools sin volts two

626
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,159
engineering about them not being

627
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,480
ignored I can't believe these idiots

628
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
they don't care about us that's how

629
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
appsec is or has been at least right

630
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,280
that sucks

631
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,059
um

632
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,460
so threat modeling should help you find

633
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,620
real areas of concern and exploitable

634
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,940
vulnerabilities this is what you should

635
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,460
start before you run a single tool

636
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,140
this is everything this is how you

637
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,700
should do this before you hire so you

638
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,020
know who to hire so you know what kind

639
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,360
of what kind of blind spots you have on

640
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,659
your side what are your weaknesses you

641
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:28,919
need to build out a procedure for threat

642
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,179
modeling so others can learn and

643
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,380
Implement you shouldn't be the only

644
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,760
person threat modeling I have every one

645
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,919
of my Engineers on my embedded teams

646
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,900
connect threat model now and they're

647
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,220
good at it they're better than me they

648
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,260
find all kinds of stuff

649
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,860
um

650
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,720
you shouldn't be threat modeling alone I

651
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,400
usually try and have an engineer sales

652
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,919
engineer or architect related thing with

653
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,440
threat models I invite people in that

654
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,700
normally wouldn't be there because they

655
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,039
think differently a diverse mindset and

656
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,600
a diverse group of people are going to

657
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,080
find diverse vulnerabilities

658
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,919
this is an awesome chance to build

659
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,720
Bridges with engineering especially if

660
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
they have never done this before they

661
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,220
get so excited it's like Teach an

662
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,080
engineer how to run burp Suite or take

663
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,020
them into a threat modeling meeting give

664
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,500
them a beer everybody's so yeah and then

665
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,840
we can do this and did you know that we

666
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,460
keep plain text passwords and I'm like

667
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,220
what the

668
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,220
no no we don't do that and then I have

669
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,400
to like you know reel it back in but you

670
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,500
find that stuff with the engineers you

671
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,640
don't find that stuff on I mean yeah

672
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,620
you'll find plain text passwords on your

673
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,120
own because that's dumb but you don't

674
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,620
find the real vulnerabilities until

675
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,360
you're like oh yeah yeah we SSH into

676
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,559
that box and we all share the same

677
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,740
password

678
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,900
okay that's another time that my

679
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,700
appendix burst when in a meeting you

680
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,039
know and it's it's not going to happen

681
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,020
though unless you bring them in so make

682
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,919
it fun

683
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,900
at beer food drink and black hoodies

684
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,280
give them black hoodies they think

685
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,419
they're hacking just give them black

686
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,679
hoodie like here this is our company

687
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,200
black hoodie now you're a hacker sweet

688
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,240
um and this is like my perfect threat

689
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,500
model

690
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,539
um but you know that's how it works

691
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,400
government Overlord so yeah I made this

692
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,860
big joke about the feds last time and uh

693
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,200
and then I didn't read the schedule at

694
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,620
RVA SEC and the FBI followed my talk

695
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,020
and they were like I was like tell my

696
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,940
FBI Handler you know I hope you got my

697
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,799
Christmas present and the guy's on there

698
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,820
he's like Dave I didn't get your

699
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,200
Christmas present and you've been bad

700
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,120
and I was like

701
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,260
shoot so

702
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,740
okay sdlc secure software development

703
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,720
life cycle yay this is what everybody

704
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,059
thinks appsec is and it is this is this

705
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,440
is our road map

706
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,740
road map uh secure sdlc is implementing

707
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,299
a set of controls to secure your

708
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,400
software development life cycle your

709
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,559
threat model first like I just said you

710
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,559
can't secure what you don't understand

711
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,940
pushing left is not always the right

712
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,559
place to start I know if there's a sales

713
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,440
person in here they're like that's wrong

714
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,940
you need relationships built on

715
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,679
Implement all these controls if you not

716
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,240
you will get ignored you have to build

717
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,980
those relationships first this is super

718
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,020
hard but like I know every engineering

719
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,419
manager I know our VP engineering very

720
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,940
very well I have buy-in from product I

721
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,640
did all of that before I started even

722
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,159
running tools or anything

723
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:11,940
um

724
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,620
you got to start with one control you

725
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,659
got to plan out the next year and then

726
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,220
you got to constantly adjust when people

727
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,919
like throw a fit about it you have to be

728
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
flexible many things won't work and you

729
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,340
won't understand your work culture until

730
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,679
you screw up and you piss a lot of

731
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,559
people off but if you're cool and you're

732
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,020
humble and you're like I'm so sorry you

733
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,419
know I baked you a Turkey

734
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,039
um they're gonna be like okay it's not

735
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,419
that bad he gave us turkey you know

736
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,559
whatever I don't know what you're gonna

737
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,620
make them but after implementing control

738
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,080
step back and build a plan for

739
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,480
continuous Improvement my KR is every

740
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,400
single month continuous Improvement is a

741
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,539
giant one there

742
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,520
it's boring

743
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,940
but it actually works these tools I

744
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,320
don't care who you have you have Snick

745
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,120
it's going to take you I know it's like

746
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,820
sneaky sneaky I don't know you have that

747
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,380
one it's going to take you a year to get

748
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,279
that right

749
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,600
don't listen to a single sales person

750
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,940
they're all liars except ours they're

751
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,840
good

752
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,500
um

753
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,659
any of these guys that sell appsec tools

754
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,360
they take so long to tune and it's not

755
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,039
just like the false positive stuff it's

756
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,080
getting your vulnerability management

757
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,559
process down it's figuring out what is

758
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,360
false positives and actually can't be

759
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,820
exploited as opposed to just things you

760
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,740
know that like oh that shouldn't be a

761
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,840
big deal until that third party library

762
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,120
that we had accidentally dropped

763
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,440
something and now they can compound

764
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,299
everything and now we're screwed

765
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,919
it takes a long time to get these things

766
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,659
so continuous improvements massive and

767
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,919
it builds trust with your engineering

768
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,480
team if they see you

769
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,779
suck a little less each quarter on how

770
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,520
you address vulnerabilities and how much

771
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,200
time you wasted of theirs they're like

772
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,059
okay those guys are doing their thing

773
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,299
they're maturing it's a young team

774
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:51,960
um

775
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,039
what else did I put in there

776
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,299
if a control is a blocking control start

777
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,460
it as an education and suggestion

778
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,279
control slowly move it to blocking to

779
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,440
mandatory make sure you have buy-in and

780
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
written policy

781
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,880
write your policies you need

782
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,100
that's the stick right you don't ever

783
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,380
want to use the stick but you're like no

784
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,200
you can't write your own crypto dum-dum

785
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,360
they're like why not I'm an amazing

786
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,760
developer like it's in the policy

787
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,100
I put that as number one you were never

788
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,659
allowed to do that

789
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,340
um it makes a huge difference but if

790
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,600
it's a blocking control if you're

791
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,279
putting something in your CI CD pipeline

792
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,159
it's a tool and somehow it has blocking

793
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,900
don't do it

794
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,779
don't do it for a full year I know that

795
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:37,980
sounds crazy

796
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,200
wait to see how many times you would

797
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,380
have screwed up prod

798
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,299
before you have the balls to block it

799
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,940
really like threat model take your time

800
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,679
on everything it's really important

801
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,140
because that's a super way to like burn

802
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,179
all that value that you made they're

803
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,620
like you're just wasting our time now I

804
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,480
had to have 22 Engineers this weekend

805
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,179
roll that back because we couldn't get

806
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,039
it out in time and then we pushed it too

807
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,940
fast and you know it gets it can get bad

808
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,820
step for each control I actually have

809
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,460
these written down on my desk it sounds

810
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,020
silly but I have to remind myself

811
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,400
because I get ahead of myself and just

812
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,159
run through things so you want to learn

813
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,600
what are we going to solve technology we

814
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,520
use what part of the company do we need

815
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,860
to understand uh enumerate

816
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,320
plan get all the people involved and

817
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,760
start putting everything together design

818
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,799
look at how to implement the control in

819
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,480
your company it needs to be a holistic

820
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,340
approach don't just read anybody's book

821
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,539
on apps that can be like that's how we

822
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,279
do it think for yourself you're all

823
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,720
intelligent people if you're an appsec

824
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,520
there's no dummies here

825
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,440
um you need to get your approval and

826
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,720
your buy-in before you execute that's a

827
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,460
huge huge deal and you need to figure

828
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,980
out who actually you need that approval

829
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,840
and buying from it's a big deal you miss

830
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,580
that one person and you screw up their

831
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,900
team and you jam them up you're going to

832
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,440
have a rough day right so execute do

833
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,240
your plan right and then improve that's

834
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,620
the other thing you figure out where

835
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,480
they're pissed you go hey I'm so sorry I

836
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,460
screwed this up please let me come back

837
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,100
and fix it and make it better for you

838
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,440
okay this is my sdlc plan uh that I like

839
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,720
kind of I mean

840
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,640
this is the basic stuff right these are

841
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,039
the controls you want to implement

842
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,200
um that's really small and I don't have

843
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,980
glasses on uh but yeah so you know sras

844
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,340
threat modeling uh you know you got all

845
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,020
these different uh companies in here

846
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,580
that you can just buy and do stuff with

847
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,500
and they make your day suck every day

848
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,940
and then you have to have calls with

849
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,679
their sales people every other week and

850
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,020
you just learn to hate them

851
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,120
sorry I zoned out a little

852
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,360
um you know but uh these are the things

853
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,220
you have to cover you know it's kind of

854
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,779
hard I'm not going to go through all

855
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:46,980
that there's a million talks about that

856
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,600
but my slides are here or if you just

857
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,399
hit me up on LinkedIn I'll tell you what

858
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,620
I'm thinking first control

859
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,080
boom should be holistic I like that word

860
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,580
based on your company

861
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,220
don't start with stats that's not

862
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,840
holistic that just pisses everybody off

863
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,299
SAS has is a very important tool that

864
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,159
static analysis security testing if you

865
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,860
don't know super important tons of false

866
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,960
positives makes everybody angry don't

867
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,279
start with SAS that is a good way to

868
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,720
just plummet your program and it's

869
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,340
expensive

870
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,559
um and if you do one uh find one that

871
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,299
you can tune

872
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,340
very easily that's I'm not going to like

873
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,500
give Brands and stuff uh pick and

874
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,240
control with low false except for Red

875
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,580
Canary you can always use them uh pick

876
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,080
control with low false positives for

877
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,580
your first one this is huge writing

878
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,080
policy to back up your Patrol like we

879
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,539
talked about you need to be thoughtful

880
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,640
set your tone for the entire security

881
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,799
program this is so much bigger than you

882
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,020
understand in the beginning that first

883
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,039
control

884
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,559
is like if you can kind of go okay with

885
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,659
it people like okay they didn't burn the

886
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,260
house down yet you know but you will

887
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,880
piss someone off cookies and beer help

888
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,679
it's true

889
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,779
okay don't there's a trigger warning

890
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,279
don't get dazzled by shift left

891
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,399
everybody knapsack shift left shift left

892
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,580
shut up it's a horrible way to start

893
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,500
you should shift left after you have a

894
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,720
mature program

895
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,860
sometimes you're better off shifting

896
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,960
right fewer false positives the further

897
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,580
right you go the farther left you go you

898
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,840
have tons and tons of more false

899
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,679
positives

900
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,140
uh shifting left will still be a goal

901
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,260
but sometimes it's easier to start right

902
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,419
next controls

903
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,700
different for every team holistic

904
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,460
approach uh you have a budget and a lot

905
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,899
of code

906
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:31,260
you could try saster SCA

907
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,700
um

908
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
I wouldn't say SAS I just put that in

909
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,299
there I'd say you know

910
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,279
try SCA that's a lot better all your

911
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,740
third party analysis uh are you

912
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,659
overwhelmed is it just you and you're

913
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,240
like I'm drowning security Champions or

914
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,520
slackbot my slackbot's gangster my

915
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,960
slackbot will tell you how dumb you are

916
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,179
when you do something and it'll also

917
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,860
give you praise it's like hey good job

918
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,120
buddy

919
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,059
you didn't write your own crypto today

920
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,919
um hired some folks

921
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,500
yes we have a team now embedded security

922
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,240
Engineers I'm very passionate about this

923
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,100
we are one to one right now that's not

924
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,919
realistic for anybody I mean that's like

925
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:10,260
oh one to three is fine you can sit

926
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,860
through three 15-minute

927
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,260
um stand-ups right and you can do that

928
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,360
two times a week and you actually know

929
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,679
what code is going on you know what

930
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,120
issues the engineers are actually

931
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,580
working on at that moment massive thing

932
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,380
if you have enough people

933
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,559
uh sort of fancy new product coming out

934
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,299
if you talk to your product team do you

935
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,580
know your product team if you don't know

936
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,720
your product team

937
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,399
get to know them because those are the

938
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,659
guys that are like we're gonna build

939
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,279
this thing and I don't know how

940
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,020
engineering Works we're gonna plug stuff

941
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,760
into it and then it's going to do these

942
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,799
things and then everybody's gonna lose

943
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,020
their data all right if you become

944
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,279
friends with them you can threat model

945
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,500
or do sras right off the bat security

946
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,820
risk assessments are kind of like old

947
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,380
school you know but we still do them

948
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,820
because they kind of

949
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,640
make you look at at the engineering and

950
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
the code and everything so it can be

951
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
important

952
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,039
um what worked for me

953
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,899
for my first ones for this last let's

954
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,159
get to go with Red Canary that's what

955
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,020
this one is Dash and thread modeling

956
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,240
that's how I started I love dast

957
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Das Das it's cheap no one cares about it

958
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,980
anybody can buy burp sweet

959
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,659
zap sucks

960
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,880
um but you know it's

961
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,159
it's amazing run run desk you're

962
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,620
actually finding real

963
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,720
problems in production

964
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,159
don't run on production if you can't

965
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,340
handle it like don't just go ha and then

966
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,320
you crash production uh it's it's great

967
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,120
if you have a safe place you can run it

968
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,100
locally or something like that

969
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,360
um but it's a great place to start

970
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,640
because when you do find things it'll be

971
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,740
a manageable list like you run your even

972
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,539
if it's just burp spider or something

973
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:43,980
like that it'll run through and it's

974
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,720
going to give you like what 30 or 40

975
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,960
things you're like okay I can one person

976
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,519
can go through this and tell which ones

977
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,679
are false positives and then you go hey

978
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,620
I broke into your system here

979
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,880
don't do it that way but it actually

980
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,100
gives you something real

981
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,080
um and then the threat modeling side is

982
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,940
amazing to start that way if that's your

983
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,260
first control you're going to not only

984
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,700
do threat modeling but you're going to

985
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,140
teach each team how to do threat

986
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,040
modeling and you're going to do it with

987
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,839
them that one builds Bridges doesn't

988
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,820
cost the company well it costs a little

989
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,339
time so that is a real thing but you can

990
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:18,000
do it and manual find some scary stuff

991
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,800
got kubernetes

992
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,418
how many of those spots you think are

993
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,179
written as root I promise you a few of

994
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,940
them are you want to see someone break a

995
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,619
container out go watch e in cold water

996
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,440
it happens so you will find some really

997
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,239
really good stuff that way and you build

998
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,679
those relationships which are super

999
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,020
important uh

1000
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,418
embedded with engineering like I said a

1001
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,918
minute ago I jumped ahead on my slide

1002
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,440
sorry uh when you're for a mature team

1003
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,179
and you're growing this is the most

1004
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,918
successful thing I've had if you don't

1005
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,960
have enough Engineers I have this thing

1006
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,379
that I call the security task force or

1007
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,960
so we're um we're a Red Canary we're all

1008
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,280
like bird names like we're the flock

1009
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,839
right so I keep trying to get them to be

1010
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,640
the murder Squad because it's the crows

1011
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,500
and they're in the black hats but it

1012
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,700
hasn't caught on yet they just think I'm

1013
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,440
weird I'm like let's go murder Squad and

1014
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,839
they're like no David sit down

1015
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,119
um but whatever that's the other way to

1016
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,800
do it you can embed these engineers and

1017
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,180
they sit in on the stand-ups and they

1018
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,640
help with stuff and they're it's amazing

1019
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
when you have a security engineer in

1020
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,420
stand up and they're like hey how should

1021
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,339
we connect to this third-party API and

1022
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,900
the guy's like oh we should do that and

1023
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,940
secure you guys like oh hey I think if

1024
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,500
we do it this way we don't really have

1025
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,839
to worry about any security issues

1026
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,000
because that way can can be good or it

1027
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,460
can be a little off and they're like oh

1028
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,320
cool thanks for making me not rewrite

1029
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
this entire API connection

1030
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,240
it's so powerful to have secure embedded

1031
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,339
Securities but

1032
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,440
not everybody can do that there's two of

1033
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,420
you there's three of you right what do

1034
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,200
you do

1035
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
get buy-in build trust you don't have to

1036
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,780
hire 10 security Engineers you can go in

1037
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,920
work your butt off a couple years in

1038
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,599
your VP of engineering is like those

1039
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,099
guys are solid they've been doing such a

1040
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,680
good job security task force

1041
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,320
get a two-week Sprint rotation with

1042
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,599
developers on the security team

1043
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,579
you will work on real development

1044
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,980
problems you'll work on backlog you know

1045
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,599
old Tech whatever you got a patch or

1046
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,599
whatever but you have these people for

1047
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,760
two weeks

1048
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,579
let's all run burp Suite today let's

1049
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,740
just destroy some crap where offensive

1050
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,099
security but these are regular Engineers

1051
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,320
they leave with a security mindset they

1052
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,599
leave that two-week Sprint with like oh

1053
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,060
the security guys do cool stuff we could

1054
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,579
do cool stuff it's like you know it's

1055
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:36,900
like a advanced version of security

1056
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,760
Champions I hate security Champions it's

1057
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,260
the name of it bothers me it sounds like

1058
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,800
some real creepy thing like but that's

1059
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,480
another way to do this if you don't have

1060
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,579
the Manpower

1061
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,420
um

1062
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,400
yeah then there's the things and the

1063
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,720
words I wrote

1064
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,640
build trust have you seen how many times

1065
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,520
I said build trust

1066
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,000
it's amazing tools yay what do we want

1067
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,180
all the tools why because we never ever

1068
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,400
ever want to stop looking at false

1069
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,740
positives for the rest of our lives

1070
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,680
oh man I'm like become a minimalist with

1071
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,839
tools I'm trying to lower it and lower

1072
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,640
it and lower it even the big name

1073
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,579
companies because I spend a lot of money

1074
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm pulling out some of their newer

1075
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,420
features because they suck

1076
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,579
they're not tested they're giving me all

1077
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,200
this trash they're built they're burning

1078
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,820
my value right now they're burning my

1079
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,920
trust with engineering and I don't care

1080
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,599
what I have to do like there's some

1081
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,579
great you know open source stuff out

1082
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,579
there like Sim grip open source and even

1083
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,500
the Snick open source and like some of

1084
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,140
those they may not be

1085
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,720
Ai and machine learning which is all Bs

1086
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,880
anyways but they can like you can tune

1087
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,859
them real easily so you can be like okay

1088
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:49,020
I know I have one problem

1089
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,540
these group of people keep writing

1090
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,040
passwords the wrong way and they're not

1091
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,320
using this so I can search for that you

1092
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,940
can start minimalizing this where you

1093
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,320
don't have to use these giant companies

1094
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,540
that just bombard you with crap all day

1095
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,640
if I have to sit in one more sales

1096
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,940
trying to re-hire me meeting thing

1097
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,680
I'm going to lose my mind

1098
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,300
but

1099
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,820
um don't trust the hype sales people can

1100
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,480
be sketchy I know I was one of them uh

1101
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,820
the less tools you do the job adequately

1102
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,760
the better uh looking at 17 things a day

1103
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,859
is the path to the dark side that's how

1104
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,099
you turn into that guy from before

1105
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,500
build a plan before you acquire the

1106
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,480
tools this is so big

1107
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,339
that like list of things that's how I

1108
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,160
started and then I had all my team

1109
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,420
members there's a lot of us there's

1110
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,579
eight of us we're we're beast mode team

1111
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:39,960
because we got buy-in from the beginning

1112
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,440
so we had budget and I'm like hey

1113
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,599
we're going to take a control one at a

1114
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,920
time we're all going to look at and

1115
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,300
we're all going to compare and I built a

1116
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
little thing in Excel and it's like does

1117
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,220
this do this plus five points does this

1118
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,079
do this plus seven points for each

1119
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,359
control so I could so I had to be more

1120
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,880
pragmatic because these sneaky sales

1121
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,099
vendors know that I like whiskey and

1122
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,359
they're like hey Dave we sent you a

1123
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,980
hundred dollar bottle of whiskey you

1124
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,079
know just for checking our demo out I'm

1125
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,300
like you sneaky and then it's even worse

1126
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,339
when you push code you know I've written

1127
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,140
a few rules for some of these companies

1128
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,700
and I started getting their t-shirts and

1129
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,160
I'm like oh I have T-shirts now I I

1130
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,960
could use them next year you know it's

1131
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,240
it's all it's a bad social engineering

1132
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,480
we're doing the good social engineering

1133
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,820
uh spend time real time testing tools I

1134
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,500
spent like 30 days on each control

1135
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,320
minimum I got pocs from all the people

1136
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,839
that were supposedly good and I pounded

1137
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,579
into them I looked at everything we had

1138
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,099
discussions like very like straight up

1139
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,079
fights at one point over certain tools

1140
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,160
because people were passionate about

1141
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,900
this that are in appsec

1142
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,640
um which I encourage I want us as long

1143
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,839
as we're not being rude to each other to

1144
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,540
basically yell about things it's good

1145
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,780
um we tested all the tools and then we

1146
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,700
made it really really rational decisions

1147
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,680
and we're already changing some from our

1148
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,920
second year uh second yeah second year

1149
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,020
acquisition stuff so you know that's

1150
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,280
that continuous Improvement side you're

1151
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,960
not going to pick and people lie they

1152
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,220
say things can do things that they can't

1153
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,260
and then you're like wow you're a

1154
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,579
billion dollar company and a

1155
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,140
three-year-old wrote your API and it

1156
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,839
crashes every single day cool I'm glad

1157
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,640
we gave you seventy thousand dollars you

1158
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,320
know it's it's insane you don't find

1159
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,700
that stuff out until later because they

1160
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,160
hide it in the pocs so be ready to tell

1161
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,440
people there's a chance we'll roll this

1162
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,480
over because we don't want to burn our

1163
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
value right

1164
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,859
um tune improve before you get another

1165
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,839
tool spend some time on it it doesn't

1166
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,300
have to be fast showing you know

1167
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,980
whoever's doing your budget VP

1168
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,099
engineering c-suite whatever CTO showing

1169
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,599
them how fast you're moving and how much

1170
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,980
you've Acquired and burned through your

1171
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,640
budget is not show anything like it to

1172
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,839
us it does because we're like look at

1173
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,900
all we did if you get one tool and then

1174
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,460
you spend the next month making it

1175
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,560
perfect as perfect as you can before you

1176
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,359
roll it out you're testing it locally

1177
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:55,740
and making sure you're not just going to

1178
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,900
destroy everybody the people up top

1179
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,119
appreciate that because redoing

1180
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,339
something engineering wise costs a lot

1181
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,500
more than doing it the right time right

1182
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,780
so spend some time it's a slow process

1183
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,520
don't get you know worried about it and

1184
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,839
explain all those things up front for

1185
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,060
whoever your buy-in is

1186
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,119
uh no budget no toys

1187
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,820
yeah so how do we get budget

1188
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,060
hey what's our time sorry on this one 3

1189
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,500
45 to 4 4 okay cool uh we're fine

1190
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,940
how do we budget apps that program this

1191
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,220
really is the internet if you didn't

1192
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,200
know this if you don't work in appsec

1193
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,000
with third-party libraries

1194
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,099
when that idiot didn't sign the stuff

1195
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,740
for Ruby last year we're a ruby shop I

1196
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,839
had an aneurysm like I was like what am

1197
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,700
I gonna do we have all these customers

1198
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,200
we have to fix this things and Nancy

1199
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,099
can't use it because he didn't change

1200
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,420
his licensing and blah blah blah blah

1201
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,500
blah

1202
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,599
have backup plans for your third party

1203
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,339
libraries you know and have them written

1204
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,079
down I know that sounds crazy but I

1205
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,420
literally have a list of what we have

1206
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,520
you know on a Excel spreadsheet because

1207
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,760
I'm in Tech and then next to it I have

1208
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,560
competitors that I can grab because I

1209
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,180
don't you can't memorize all this crap

1210
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,880
there's so much so I know like okay we

1211
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,900
just lost that because of a

1212
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,640
vulnerability we can't patch let's see

1213
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,920
who we can plug in there

1214
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,140
um it's work but it's it makes things go

1215
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,040
fast

1216
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,859
so sometimes you can't

1217
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,020
open source tools that's what you got to

1218
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,640
do they still cost they still cost money

1219
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,920
it's just Manpower they cost more for

1220
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,500
tuning for all these kind of things and

1221
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,599
I'm getting pretty burnt out on a lot of

1222
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,280
the vendors that build off the open

1223
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
source and they're like oh built you

1224
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,980
this amazing GUI it's going to work

1225
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,300
better so you pay us money and then it

1226
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,700
doesn't you're like cool

1227
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,460
so you really have to decide like what

1228
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,599
are we going to build where are we going

1229
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,599
to buy it's it's a really tricky thing

1230
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,940
um but you can slowly show value which

1231
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,560
will earn a new budget but you have to

1232
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,820
be upfront about it be like I'm going to

1233
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,440
prove to you that we're a team that's

1234
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,599
worth money in this company

1235
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,460
we're gonna and and we're gonna do that

1236
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,960
here's my plan

1237
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,000
so you don't jam up engineering

1238
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,560
uh you plan everything out Implement

1239
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,420
control slowly in fact it'd be super

1240
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,880
open with everybody that has buy-in on

1241
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,099
this it's massive deal you need to tell

1242
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:05,880
people because they're going to spend

1243
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
100 Grand 200 Grand if you're at like

1244
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,200
Amex we're half my team because I stole

1245
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,780
them uh used to be I mean they spend

1246
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,160
like three four or five million a year

1247
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,280
on their security tools right so

1248
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,560
earn that trust and you can just be open

1249
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,060
from the beginning

1250
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,319
um you got to plan everything out you

1251
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,579
got to keep your metrics and findings

1252
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:24,839
remediation we'll talk about metrics

1253
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,119
metrics suck but you I have like a few

1254
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,740
things that help me and you have to

1255
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,300
build those bridges you really do and

1256
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,619
you got to keep that communication I

1257
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,180
have one-on-ones with so many people in

1258
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,339
my company that are like 30 minute like

1259
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:36,720
coffee morning I have like this big

1260
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,980
espresso machine so I'm always like

1261
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,119
making espressos and hanging out with

1262
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,160
people and it seems like I'm wasting

1263
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,720
time I'm not when I need to get

1264
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,220
something done I'm the person that

1265
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,200
anybody in security I'm the whole it

1266
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,660
team will go to because I I care about

1267
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,520
people and we've built relationships and

1268
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,200
we're friends

1269
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,040
um

1270
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,020
now with some value you do these things

1271
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,819
you got to learn to communicate a

1272
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,500
business-based audience to a

1273
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,880
business-based audience if you can show

1274
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,619
Executives why financially it's good for

1275
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,560
your company you'll get a real budget

1276
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,000
being able to communicate effectively

1277
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,240
with c-suite and board it's what uh you

1278
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,859
know that's how you can get an exploit

1279
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,140
cost the company how much money okay

1280
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,119
this is how it works that's that's hard

1281
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,260
to communicate if you're not used to it

1282
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,460
if you're just used to working with

1283
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,819
Engineers I career coach a bunch of

1284
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,220
people like as part of like my wife and

1285
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,079
I's Ministry is get people

1286
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,980
from poorer areas or you know places

1287
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,359
where they never heard that you can make

1288
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:32,940
real money in Tech into Tech and the

1289
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,200
number one thing I do and it doesn't

1290
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,359
matter if you're you know black white

1291
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,160
Latino like whatever

1292
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,960
if you're from that area I make you go

1293
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,000
to Toastmasters before you even start

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,500
anything

1295
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,119
and people are like that's weird I'm

1296
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,740
like no it's not do you know how many

1297
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,660
interviews I have were guys smart but he

1298
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,400
can't even say his own name because he's

1299
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
never had to like communicate things

1300
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,960
properly how are you going to tell

1301
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,660
the CEO that we're going to lose 40

1302
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,660
million dollars if they don't spend 150

1303
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,760
000 on engineering right now to fix a

1304
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,319
problem

1305
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,540
you know that's the difference between a

1306
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,940
hundred thousand dollar abstract job and

1307
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,819
a 250 000 abstract jog is being able to

1308
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:13,079
communicate that line that's the

1309
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,760
difference between a CSO and like

1310
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,900
someone who's going to tap out a

1311
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,920
principal and they're never going to

1312
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,560
move into in into any of that stuff so

1313
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,520
it's huge and um like I used to do bids

1314
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,319
with my company and I worked across that

1315
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:26,700
and I know I talk like a dumb Surfer

1316
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,660
because I'm from Hawaii and everything

1317
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,099
but uh I know how to like get value get

1318
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,280
distress if something's really bad I can

1319
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,560
I can go through and tell people in a

1320
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,660
way that works for me and works for them

1321
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,000
and it's sounds silly but it's massive

1322
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,520
useful metrics

1323
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,740
God I hate metrics so you might hear

1324
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,420
have to build their own metrics

1325
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,420
yes you feel my pain bro

1326
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,060
they suck so much and I've like lost my

1327
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,220
mind because I hate Splunk I don't know

1328
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,660
the language I'm always trying to like

1329
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,880
Google it on stack exchange like how do

1330
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,800
you make a pie chart and Splunk and then

1331
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,720
I'm like I hate this

1332
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,880
keyboard against the wall

1333
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,640
um okay this is what I do they're so

1334
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,060
hard but I figured out what metrics need

1335
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,140
to do

1336
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,359
I like hacked metrics

1337
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,220
at least for my head because I'm so

1338
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,720
pragmatic I have to like figure these

1339
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,760
things out so I can follow a path

1340
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,740
um they need to tell a story

1341
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,380
and the social engineering part What

1342
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,359
story do they need to tell for who

1343
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,040
you have to figure out what that person

1344
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,359
thinks and what they want from their job

1345
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,099
and I've actually asked people this

1346
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,740
because half time csos will ask you for

1347
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,720
metrics and you're like I'm like what

1348
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,640
are you trying to get from this

1349
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,099
and they don't know they're just so

1350
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:42,960
ingrained in it that they have no idea

1351
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,800
what they're doing and you're like okay

1352
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,300
we really need to figure this out before

1353
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,680
I go and waste a bunch of time and

1354
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,260
Splunk and cry for the next six weeks

1355
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,359
um so now I make them

1356
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,460
I make my metrics tell a story and I

1357
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,859
make them tell a story that's going to

1358
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,140
fix the question that needs to be asked

1359
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,180
by whoever it is asking me for it and

1360
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,460
they have to like put their time into I

1361
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,619
don't ever anymore when someone's like I

1362
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:11,099
want some metrics on that tool like no

1363
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,020
I'm not gonna waste time on that tell me

1364
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,000
what you want answered and I will build

1365
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,220
you a beautiful colorful story

1366
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,280
in horrible Splunk dashboards you know

1367
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,900
um but that that really is what it is

1368
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,000
and it's It's tricky because

1369
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,619
you know it can be the little things

1370
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:26,579
like

1371
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,440
well we had this many vulnerabilities

1372
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,480
last month and we only have this many

1373
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,040
this month and it's like did that really

1374
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,480
help us

1375
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,520
I mean it showed that somebody updated

1376
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,900
one package

1377
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,480
what's our risk there like what what

1378
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,240
percentage of risk do we reduce on the

1379
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,579
company like then you got to build a few

1380
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,140
more things because you're like okay I'm

1381
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,000
now telling a story I'm showing the

1382
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
c-suite that we lowered reduce lowered

1383
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,319
the risk reduction by 15 this quarter

1384
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,599
because we knocked out 1500 critical

1385
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,680
vulnerabilities that couldn't be

1386
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,300
exploited but if something fell apart

1387
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,000
they could you know what I mean and this

1388
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,740
is all ethereal this is a little hard to

1389
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,380
like get in there and figure out but now

1390
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,180
you're showing like okay well if this is

1391
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,339
real we might have saved the company a

1392
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,319
million dollars okay you guys are worth

1393
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,839
a little bit more now you know we were

1394
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,480
ahead because we had all this fixed when

1395
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,099
that patch came out we could actually

1396
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,140
patch because we're on the correct

1397
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,760
version of Ruby on Rails right now

1398
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,920
instead of you know six years behind

1399
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,240
because no one will change any of their

1400
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,700
code like those kind of things that's

1401
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,960
massive because I'd be like hey we

1402
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,220
patched this we wouldn't have been able

1403
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,020
to patch it and we would have got busted

1404
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,920
on this one it's like when um

1405
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,920
uh uh what was it called HTTP smuggling

1406
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,800
I found that at our company uh using

1407
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,020
burp and I was like oh my gosh we have

1408
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,579
to figure this out it like got in there

1409
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:48,780
with engineering and spent much time it

1410
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,000
was Amazon's fault stupid Cloud Player

1411
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,339
uh but then I called them you know and

1412
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:54,960
and had it fixed but it was like one of

1413
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,980
those things if we wouldn't had our

1414
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,359
ducks in the row and we weren't

1415
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,500
organized and I wouldn't have already

1416
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,660
proved value when I called cloudflare

1417
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,859
they probably wouldn't like kick rocks

1418
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,020
but we were big dog it wasn't right

1419
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,160
Canary

1420
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,640
um but those kind of things are huge

1421
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,780
um so

1422
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,880
you need to have some sort of view on

1423
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,740
things

1424
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,660
education training is massive I'm in

1425
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,099
charge of this at our company right now

1426
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:18,920
for this quarter

1427
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,599
it's the hardest thing there is but I

1428
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,220
I'm so passionate about it but I'm also

1429
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,599
so burnt out on it because it's so

1430
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,339
tricky but

1431
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,520
um education training can't suck

1432
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,200
I don't know how to tell anybody does

1433
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,240
that you know like I've bought the big

1434
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,300
vendors and I've I've used our own and

1435
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,460
I don't even know what I wrote on here

1436
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,480
actually

1437
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,359
uh social engineer security culture in

1438
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,579
your company that's so important uh

1439
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,140
onboarding from the beginning you need

1440
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,980
to do it uh be passionate about teaching

1441
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,700
I'm just running through this because

1442
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,359
I'm going to change it

1443
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:54,660
um

1444
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,040
yeah

1445
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,619
Okay cool so that that's all true still

1446
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,300
uh this is where I'm at right now with

1447
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,400
it though because I just revamped this

1448
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,200
again

1449
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,240
I have a company that gives the little

1450
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,800
training where the engineers can go in

1451
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,359
and we do a quarterly training and they

1452
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,740
have to do their apps like training and

1453
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,180
blah blah blah blah

1454
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,300
and they do it because I begged them

1455
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,560
literally they didn't they like threw a

1456
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,819
fit in the beginning but I had enough

1457
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,400
invested that I'm like bro how many

1458
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,020
times have I got the bar tab for you

1459
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,520
guys like you're gonna do this it's

1460
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,980
gonna take you an hour a quarter

1461
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,599
um and then I also because the new guys

1462
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,880
don't know any better everybody comes

1463
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,740
along gets that training uh they have

1464
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,540
like I built out a special one just for

1465
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,280
onboarding to make sure we hit all the

1466
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,440
basics for our code base what like we

1467
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,000
could see them introducing you don't

1468
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,960
need to hit them with a bunch of stuff

1469
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,460
like

1470
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,800
that they can't use if you cannot be SQL

1471
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,480
injected don't make them train on SQL

1472
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,680
injection

1473
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,079
um but now

1474
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,140
I built a couple ctfs that we all did

1475
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,579
and now I'm doing some stuff where I'm

1476
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:54,900
looking at all the metrics from there

1477
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,000
right seeing where we fail over and over

1478
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,980
what stuff we actually hit on I'm like

1479
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,819
okay okay well this team works for uh

1480
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,920
Linux agent we built our own you know

1481
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,720
and this team Works mostly with the

1482
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,520
Microsoft stuff and this team is our

1483
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,380
Cloud team

1484
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,300
they all have a security engineer

1485
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,400
so the next step for us is they're going

1486
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,900
to do lunch and learns with their team

1487
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,460
that are pinpointed to their weakest

1488
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,440
points so it's actually interesting to

1489
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,000
them because they know they suck at it

1490
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,619
every engineer knows they suck at what

1491
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,300
they suck at like especially if you just

1492
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,040
get busted on it you know with multiple

1493
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,200
times with different tools

1494
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,119
so now we're pinpointing we're getting a

1495
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,440
little bit better but it's still a long

1496
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,359
way to go this is the hardest one if you

1497
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,220
can figure out how to train people and

1498
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,900
make security fun in your company and

1499
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,980
every company has a different culture

1500
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,319
you're going to win because then I mean

1501
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,819
my whole thing is to work myself out of

1502
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,619
a job I've already almost done that I

1503
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:44,760
hired a lot of people are smarter than

1504
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,500
me I'm like okay maybe I'll just go to

1505
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,200
sales make giant money now but it's the

1506
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,000
same thing with this stuff if I can make

1507
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,500
all my Engineers into security people

1508
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,740
why would I even want to uh be around

1509
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,180
anymore I'm okay I'll go do something

1510
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,760
else I'll make canoes

1511
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,859
uh social engineering security culture

1512
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,559
culture good social engineering learns

1513
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,300
what is beneficial to both parties this

1514
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,339
is my sales background knows the

1515
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:10,380
audience has buy-in from all parties

1516
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,900
needed builds a culture based on trust

1517
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,819
and visibility servant leadership bad

1518
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,160
social engineering self-focused goals

1519
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,119
are you just trying to get stuff done

1520
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,220
for you if you're not adding value to

1521
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,599
whoever you're doing it to then it's not

1522
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,460
good does not benefit all parties

1523
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,200
involved manipulation zero visibility

1524
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,240
uses a stick instead of the carrot so I

1525
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,380
was going to be a physical penetration

1526
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,119
guy I can break into anything in the

1527
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,460
world like I grew up first job as a

1528
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,680
locksmith I love all that crap uh then I

1529
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,300
had kids I'm like okay I actually want

1530
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,640
to be home for my kids but it's a

1531
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,619
massive thing the bad side of social

1532
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,240
engineering I'm very good at it I can

1533
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,980
walk in anywhere even with this big

1534
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,020
stupid mustache I when I was like 15 I

1535
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,760
snuck into tons and tons of concerts by

1536
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,260
just walking backstage and acting like I

1537
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,880
was supposed to be there and that kind

1538
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,859
of stuff

1539
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:54,119
that is the side though that I see in

1540
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,460
security they're just like oh man you

1541
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,440
know you need to do this and do this and

1542
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,240
like there's like Dave told me to be

1543
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,180
nice to you I was like no you have to

1544
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,800
offer them something in return there has

1545
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,119
to be something there yeah I'm going to

1546
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,740
take you out and you know make you talk

1547
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,660
to people and eat good food and drink

1548
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,760
beer and stuff like that but

1549
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,740
that's not me getting him do it I'm

1550
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,720
always giving them value somehow

1551
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,040
and you have to figure out what it is

1552
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,660
for yours you know I've had instances

1553
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,700
where we fix code it makes their life a

1554
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,839
thousand times better because their

1555
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,880
code's more organized they have testing

1556
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,220
in place now and they're not getting

1557
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,260
jammed up when they're trying to push to

1558
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,240
prod anymore because it's not a tangled

1559
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,059
mess that's huge value you just got to

1560
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,020
figure out what it's going to be for

1561
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,520
your little team that you're working

1562
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,319
with

1563
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,660
um yeah we went through all this stuff

1564
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,420
continuous Improvement

1565
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,400
I'm on this next quarter I'm running

1566
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,900
continuous Improvement I hate it because

1567
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,220
it's vulnerability reduction all that

1568
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,319
kind of stuff uh but it's so important

1569
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:51,599
one should you control can ruin your

1570
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,000
whole program uh constantly improve

1571
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,220
everything you implement uh why would

1572
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,780
anybody take it seriously if the team

1573
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,400
doesn't care which happens all the time

1574
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,839
right you have Sloppy code you have

1575
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,640
Sloppy tools you have Sloppy findings

1576
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,980
you don't know why are they going to

1577
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,440
respect you right you know it's like one

1578
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,000
of those things like I'm definitely that

1579
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,319
guy like makes my bed in the morning

1580
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,760
even though I'm like the biggest Dirtbag

1581
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,440
I like lived in Vans half my life and

1582
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,640
I'm like I'm gonna make my bed in the

1583
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,960
morning this is gonna you know you can

1584
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,180
respect me now but it's the same thing

1585
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,059
you gotta like take care of your stuff

1586
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:23,460
um refine the obvious things first get a

1587
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,540
recurring meeting with engineering

1588
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,140
managers uh to critique controls huge

1589
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,780
get a meeting once a month please tell

1590
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,280
me what I'm doing that's making you

1591
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,839
angry and sucks

1592
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,540
I say it just like that and there was oh

1593
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,119
yeah this was my time to kick you right

1594
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,680
in the balls Dave

1595
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,180
um but it's so important because you get

1596
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,520
honest feedback and they love it they're

1597
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,660
like oh you're actually you actually

1598
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,460
care about this stuff instead of

1599
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,780
fighting in like a stupid meeting about

1600
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,099
it

1601
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,140
um refined controls by studying your

1602
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,240
super sweet new metrics automate

1603
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,240
everything you can because working sucks

1604
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,619
um be customer focused to your

1605
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,240
engineering team and be objective just

1606
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,500
because it's your favorite tool does not

1607
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,420
mean it does not suck

1608
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,980
usually it's always my favorite tool

1609
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,180
that I have to like roll back I'm like

1610
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,640
dang it failed again and I failed many

1611
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,660
times

1612
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,420
uh some ways forward

1613
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,119
ah yeah easy stuff try to find the most

1614
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,680
uh obvious things first wait

1615
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,119
is that a different one oh yeah it was

1616
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
sorry

1617
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,180
oh no that was it I didn't even know I

1618
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,059
hit it okay yeah so and that's pretty

1619
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:29,400
much it it's it's a weird talk right

1620
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,140
it's appsec without all the cool

1621
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,400
technical stuff and I didn't show you

1622
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,559
how many times I've broken something

1623
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,079
hacking people is a hell of a lot harder

1624
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:39,599
than hacking code but is the most

1625
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,099
important thing and that's why appsec

1626
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,059
Engineers are making more than just

1627
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,440
about anybody right now it's stupid

1628
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,660
money so uh I'm on LinkedIn I'm super

1629
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,000
open to this stuff if if you ever need

1630
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,380
questions asked or anything like that

1631
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,540
just I'm I'll I'll talk with you if you

1632
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,559
need like business stuff I have a

1633
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,119
consulting company you think but does

1634
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,680
anybody have any questions

1635
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,380
oh whoa okay let's we'll go this way is

1636
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,680
that cool

1637
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,780
for education

1638
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,940
uh yes if there are any training methods

1639
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,500
that work better than others in my

1640
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,040
experience uh no

1641
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,420
you know what I've the only thing I

1642
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,180
found is an individual approach on

1643
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,440
trying to figure out

1644
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,780
what helps people and and how to get

1645
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,180
them excited that security task force

1646
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,500
thing does more than any of the

1647
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,839
educational stuff if I can sit down like

1648
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:33,420
uh like our ctfs that we have because we

1649
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,559
have quarterly get togethers that are

1650
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,119
work because we're all remote

1651
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:39,319
um our CTF hackathon stuff goes

1652
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:41,579
people get so excited about that kind of

1653
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:43,020
stuff and then you can be like okay cool

1654
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,220
and like while you're there because

1655
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,660
you're actually involved you're like hey

1656
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,740
let's do this I'm going to show you guys

1657
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,839
how to use burp real quick or you know

1658
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,280
like I'm going to show you guys how to

1659
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,380
throw a SCA scan on all your code real

1660
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,400
quick to look at your third party

1661
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,800
libraries like that kind of stuff goes

1662
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,780
super good and it's not it's almost like

1663
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,579
not teaching but teaching you're

1664
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:02,460
secretly teaching yeah so is that

1665
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,059
hopefully at all

1666
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,740
what do you think people can get well

1667
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,800
yeah at my company they get behind the

1668
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,960
idea my CEO wrote half the code we're

1669
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,359
all security people at Red Canary I'm

1670
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,380
cheating

1671
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,240
most places no

1672
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,460
you're not going to get

1673
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,040
uh the c-suite of a non-technical

1674
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,400
company behind security but you can

1675
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,520
learn to communicate risk to them on and

1676
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,680
on financial level to the point where

1677
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,640
they're like

1678
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,559
we don't like this but we're scared to

1679
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,319
death of these guys like and it sounds

1680
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,720
bad but that's the only way that I've

1681
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,119
seen it really work and I've sat down in

1682
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,040
meetings where people hired me on to

1683
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,980
Consulting and I talked to the CEOs and

1684
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,420
I like went through some stuff and I'm

1685
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,500
like

1686
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,940
I'm gonna take my consulting fee for

1687
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,960
this meeting but we're going to cut it

1688
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,400
off from that because you guys aren't

1689
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,220
ready for security and and that's gnarly

1690
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,660
because you think I just take money but

1691
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,740
I actually have

1692
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,220
you know some ethics

1693
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,319
but it is no point I mean I have kids I

1694
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,280
don't want to waste my time with people

1695
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,480
who aren't trying to like better their

1696
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,880
business right so yeah it's it's that

1697
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,260
threat modeling thing I threat model

1698
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,240
everything my wife hates it she's like

1699
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,920
you're such a damn nerd but I threat

1700
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,200
model everything like you know I would

1701
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,640
look at my audience see what their

1702
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,559
weaknesses are see what the value that

1703
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,660
we can give them

1704
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,660
okay

1705
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,440
so maybe a dumb question but just to

1706
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,980
confirm there's there isn't like a

1707
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,380
Security Plus for developers there's

1708
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,660
just some kind of class or just in

1709
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,599
general like big developers this is how

1710
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,180
you security oh there's a hundred

1711
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,440
the problem is developers don't want to

1712
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,079
do them uh it slows them down developers

1713
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,900
want to create hit their kpis or KRS

1714
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,520
whatever and move on to their next cool

1715
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,040
little feature they want to build right

1716
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,900
um

1717
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,839
is if a developer usually has any

1718
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,220
interest in security they become an

1719
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,260
appsec engineer

1720
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,619
it's very difficult because and you're

1721
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,240
just giving them more time like at least

1722
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,760
all the developers I know work too much

1723
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,319
and they have hard deadlines and if

1724
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,579
you're like hey we have this five hour

1725
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:25,799
course that you need to do or like

1726
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,839
Security Plus is like a 25 hour course

1727
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,119
they're like kick rocks nerd like that

1728
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:31,980
is not happening I'm building code I'm

1729
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,240
doing my thing I've been doing this for

1730
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,040
20 years don't tell me what to do and

1731
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,540
it's it's it's a different mentality

1732
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,079
like you have to get them to care about

1733
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,400
security and then it's almost

1734
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,460
self-learning like it really is like I I

1735
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,839
generally think if you can hack that

1736
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,260
culture in there they stop uh

1737
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,540
caring about the little education you

1738
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,799
have to do and they start doing their

1739
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,540
own education

1740
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,920
does that answer you

1741
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,140
kind of sorry none of my answers are

1742
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,700
like yay

1743
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,099
