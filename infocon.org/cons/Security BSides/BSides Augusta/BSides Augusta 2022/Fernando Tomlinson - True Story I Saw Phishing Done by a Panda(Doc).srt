1
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,980
all right so this should be an exciting

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,859
talk or at least exciting to me right

3
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,960
um let's get into this uh as we do that

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,820
I'll take a quick second to kind of

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,160
introduce myself and as Murphy Law would

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,300
have it

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,760
I got some technical difficulties but we

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,380
will prevail

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,320
all right cool so uh I'm Nando I'm a

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,020
principal IR consultant with mandiant uh

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,540
a company of Google now I got to figure

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,160
out the right terminology to use when

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm saying that uh nonetheless I'm

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,120
retired from the US Army right here uh

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,059
locally I did 20 years uh the better

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,280
half of my career in the latter half

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,899
rather was in cyber security to form a

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,320
half was in I.T so no stranger to really

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,199
technology uh did some time overseas not

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,120
really important I'm also a cyber

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,920
security adjunct professor where I just

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,199
really am effectuated with education

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,960
right I recall my time really getting

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
started in this I had no idea what I'm

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,140
doing don't tell anybody but I still

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,180
have no idea what I'm doing but somebody

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,939
took the time to invest in me and I try

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,700
my hardest to to Really invest in others

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,619
there's some Powershell training

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,900
platforms again all about education and

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,100
then there's a number of other places

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,280
where I have a presence on the web but

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,439
enough about that we're not here to talk

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,659
about me we're here to talk about some

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,540
fishing right right and let's get into

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,820
some numbers right some statistics if

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,180
you will and to do this I'll reference a

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,579
report from mandiant a trusted leader of

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,920
cyber security but nonetheless a report

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,259
called M Trends right it's a annual

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,439
report produced by the company where we

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,659
highlight things that we've saw within

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
the previous year if you have not

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,560
checked it out I highly recommend you do

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,360
that there's some other cyber security

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,880
companies who also produce an annual

47
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,799
report recommend you check those out as

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,140
well but nonetheless we highlight the

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,020
top 10 frequently seeing techniques

50
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,598
right that we saw within the previous

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,700
year and you see a number of things that

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,040
are shown there but really number one

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,459
obfuscated files and or information and

54
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,160
that's where fishing really falls into

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,459
fishing isn't new right and when we look

56
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,040
at the next-gen exploit like I heard

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,660
somebody talk about earlier today and

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,400
when they're talks and not really that

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,959
being the thing that we need to focus on

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,700
well fishing is one of those things that

61
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,099
is like super tried and true and it just

62
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,920
continues to work all right so from that

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,440
perspective when we look at the top

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,080
organizations or really industries that

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,300
are impacted by this well the numbers

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,700
don't lie and again this is what we see

67
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,640
firsthand we start to see Business and

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
Professional Services clearly at the top

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
and then you start to see kind of

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,700
cascading with the number of other

71
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,819
organizations and industries as well but

72
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,480
largely speaking they're all impacted by

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,340
fishing like there's not one of them

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,620
that I can say is not has not not been

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,260
impacted by fishing and those techniques

76
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,599
they continue to involve some of them

77
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,420
have varying levels of success however

78
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,760
it is still a technique that continues

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
to be used on a daily basis and it isn't

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
just run-of-the-mill entities that are

81
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,120
doing this fishing you know the 400

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
pound person in the basement as I once

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,239
heard somebody say it's apts it's been

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,019
groups it's unks uncategorized groups as

85
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,140
mandiant knows it it's all facets of

86
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,840
Industry Industries or malicious actors

87
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,459
that are utilizing this and I keep going

88
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,220
back to why and it's because it's

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,220
working right does it work 100 of the

90
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,560
time no but it works enough to where it

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
doesn't deter them

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
so cool it's not new

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
is it detected yes it is detected

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,060
varying levels success associated with

95
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,860
that detection and really just looking

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,280
at some numbers here we have essentially

97
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,120
our our Asia area we have uh our Europe

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,459
area if you will and we have the

99
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,560
Americas right and then we have overall

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
and we can see from the perspective of

101
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,839
intrusions at large this is encompassing

102
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,300
efficient as well but not specific to

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,000
Just Fishing we start to see the

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,940
detection based upon internal we also

105
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,780
see it based upon external and really

106
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,120
from that perspective you would hope

107
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,180
that fishing is largely detected

108
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,020
internally right because John Bob gets

109
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,259
an email John Bob says it smells fishy

110
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,680
you know no pun intended and he or she

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
reports it you would hope that it isn't

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,080
reported externally well I would tell

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,139
you my experience shows that it is is a

114
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,660
subset of both and in some cases it

115
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,460
certainly is not as quick as it should

116
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,580
be

117
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,960
so

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,840
what does really fishing give us

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,259
right well for an act of malicious cyber

120
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,860
actor to have some type of action if you

121
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,780
will in an environment they need to have

122
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,300
initial compromise initial access right

123
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,220
so this is kind of what that category in

124
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,960
which fishing falls into we'll we'll

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,820
come back to this in a minute

126
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,699
we also have things like establishing a

127
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,039
foothold in that Network right so being

128
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,979
able to have a presence in that

129
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,800
organization's Network even if it is a a

130
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,380
low-level user that doesn't have any

131
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,139
rights a foothold is a foothold is a

132
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,759
foothold

133
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,400
and then at some point well that lonely

134
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,220
user was good for you know the original

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,380
purpose but we need to elevate to be

136
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,139
able to do what we really need to be

137
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,539
able to do and have the ability to

138
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,460
likely move in a fashion that we want to

139
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,160
move and or do other things so there's

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,919
going to be a time in which uh privilege

141
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,600
escalation is going to take place how

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,460
that take place well that's not for this

143
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,220
talk a number of means but after that

144
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,039
well let's spread I've elevated let's

145
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,060
see what else is out there we're going

146
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,500
to spread our wings if you will it's

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,479
going to be some form of reconnaissance

148
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,280
internally and then they're going to

149
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,139
laterally move

150
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,120
the other thing this is where we start

151
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
to lay down an actual true presence so

152
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,500
we've got the initial foothold all right

153
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,780
we're on the the system itself but this

154
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,840
is where things like C2 come into play

155
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,539
and you'll note that there is kind of

156
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,280
like a

157
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,240
um

158
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,400
an arrow if you will because it's a

159
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,340
continuous thing right kind of rinse and

160
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,199
repeat and then there's going to come a

161
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,060
point where they're going to complete

162
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,620
the mission well what is the mission

163
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,740
could be data exfiltration staging could

164
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,979
be destruction of the machine well that

165
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,280
all truly varies

166
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,740
but back to this Vision piece or really

167
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,199
this initial compromise as we look at

168
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,620
the numbers you know exploitation uh is

169
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,380
is up there and there's no shortage of

170
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,080
that and we see other things that are

171
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,960
being shown Supply chains stolen

172
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,300
credentials and then we see things like

173
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,039
fishing on there and it's not at the top

174
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,259
and I'm not here to tell you it is the

175
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,759
number one thing it is certainly not

176
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,139
however it is in the conversation in

177
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,419
terms of initial access in most

178
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,940
conversations that any of us would have

179
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,860
a cyber Security Professionals and

180
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,380
that's because the numbers don't lie and

181
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,660
certainly the data does not lie either

182
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,400
foreign

183
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,099
that

184
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,479
let's talk about a story right uh this

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,660
is a use case real world some things

186
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,259
have been uh you know changed to protect

187
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,539
the the organization if you will but

188
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,500
this is one example of many uh that I've

189
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,259
dealt with and other of my peers in the

190
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,139
organization have dealt with and we

191
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,000
continue to deal with I'll talk about at

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the end here as of roughly two weeks ago

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,979
how this is still going on and it's

194
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,940
going to continue to to persist as well

195
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,300
so getting into this I'll paint this

196
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,740
situation

197
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,259
we get this guy he's got the nice comb

198
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,139
over let me see right

199
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,419
um and we're going to call him John Doe

200
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,159
because it seems fitting

201
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,159
John Doe works for a company we'll call

202
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,719
company a

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,458
and there's his email J Doe at company a

204
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,020
he also

205
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,080
works for a company called Company B

206
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,920
and his username

207
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,899
essentially same thing J Doe but that

208
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,019
domain Company B right so he's got two

209
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,580
different email accounts for two

210
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,500
different companies

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,779
where the bad practice starts to come in

212
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,820
as we paint this situation

213
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,560
is when he needs to interact with other

214
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,220
individuals in company a you would think

215
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,940
that he would utilize his company a

216
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,980
email and you would think other

217
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,260
individuals in that organization would

218
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,959
be accustomed to receiving emails from

219
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,480
him from his company a email

220
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,240
that's what we would think that is not

221
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,180
the case however he actually utilizes

222
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,580
his company B email to do all this

223
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,600
business that concerns company a and it

224
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,279
had been going on for so long that

225
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,160
everybody had became

226
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,200
desensitized to that fact that that's

227
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,420
what he was doing and it was the norm

228
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,839
right so being that that is the case

229
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,240
anytime they receive something from his

230
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,399
company B email

231
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,240
nobody thought anything about it it was

232
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,180
normal in their eyes

233
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,019
is this on still

234
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,540
both of them I think

235
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,360
uh we'll be right back guys

236
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,720
okay what about now I'm back okay uh if

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,760
you're watching this two weeks from now

238
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,899
I apologize I didn't say anything

239
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,880
important so don't worry

240
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,660
um

241
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,940
yeah so they're used to this nobody

242
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,019
thinks anything about it because

243
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,360
homeboy's been doing it for a long time

244
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
so painting this story some more there

245
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,860
was a day

246
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,040
uh early February this is about seven

247
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,140
months eight months something like that

248
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,540
owed at this point uh there was a day

249
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,720
where buddy utilizing his company B

250
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
address sent a number of emails to

251
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
company a and as we get to the end we'll

252
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,860
talk about why some of this stuff was

253
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,560
bad outside of some of the obvious right

254
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
and some of those emails he sent to

255
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,800
individuals in company a well it was the

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,620
same email but he sent it to 180

257
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,959
individual email addresses and then he

258
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,040
sent it to 40 distribution lists uh can

259
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,019
anyone guess how many distribution lists

260
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,700
were in this organization

261
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,980
yes there were 40.

262
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,040
so we're talking anything from you know

263
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,620
I.T support with a couple of folks in

264
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,760
there to the Budget Group to

265
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,040
organization-wide uh email addresses

266
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,579
right or distro lists right so cool they

267
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,480
get it

268
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,779
this guy is a very senior person in

269
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,540
company a nobody thinks anything about

270
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,000
it they open it up and that's where

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
stuff starts to get really a little bit

272
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,079
Shady so what are some of those things

273
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
well actually let's talk about the email

274
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,320
some

275
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,260
both company a and Company B they're

276
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,140
M365 organizations two different tenants

277
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,560
so in this case uh to bypass email

278
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,779
filters in which they had which were not

279
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,760
optimally configured which is also a

280
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,459
different story for later in the talk

281
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,100
um he was sending essentially encrypted

282
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,820
messages in in Outlook or o365 or M365

283
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,420
rather protected messages so when

284
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,640
received and you have to forgive all my

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,079
redaction where I tried to go back in

286
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,600
and add company a company B when

287
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,820
received they see something like this

288
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,360
right this email you've been sent it's

289
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,399
protected it's encrypted you need to be

290
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,560
able to open it and for you to do so you

291
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,079
need to click the read the message

292
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,300
button normally that photo is there

293
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,040
right in that red box

294
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,620
and when you do that you're going to

295
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,959
have an option you can either a

296
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,920
authenticate to your uh using utilizing

297
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,320
your M365 account

298
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,600
for the email that it was sent to or B

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
you can request a one-time password so

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,940
in this case uh most people all people

301
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,180
actually during an investigation

302
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,100
requested one-time passwords right so

303
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,959
this is the screen that they would see

304
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,060
nothing really special

305
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,700
they get that one-time password again

306
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,620
they're going to put that in because at

307
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,019
this point you know John Bob meant to

308
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,180
send this to me or John Doe rather right

309
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,279
if it was bad somebody would have

310
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
stopped it before it got to me so since

311
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
it made it to me I'm going to actually

312
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,160
do what it needs to do and I'm going to

313
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,200
open this up

314
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
so when they finally decrypt the message

315
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,220
this is what they see right and you may

316
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,899
or may not be able to see actually maybe

317
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,779
you can but in circled in red there it

318
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,459
talks about this message is being sent

319
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:54,000
from again company a because it contains

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,820
particularly sensitive information at

321
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,399
this point most people are curious but

322
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,200
they still think it's for them because

323
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,839
again this is normal activity in some

324
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,980
respect

325
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,459
so for them to access it they actually

326
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,220
need to to click in that little window

327
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
there now it looks interesting because

328
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,839
you'll see that in the bottom left hand

329
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,500
corner there is uh what appears to be

330
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,240
like a Word document it's a static photo

331
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,639
it's not even tied to the actual message

332
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,800
right it's more to to draw in the person

333
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,440
so they're going to click on it and

334
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,320
again still bypassing filters it takes

335
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,139
them here right and you may or may not

336
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,300
be able to see but in the URL bar it

337
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,180
says something like Panda doc right and

338
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,560
then we get a little message in the

339
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,699
middle of the screen and if you can't

340
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,079
see that message actually you probably

341
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,260
can but if you can't you'll see that

342
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,440
that document no longer exists so you

343
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
know Panda doc what is Panda doc anybody

344
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,860
know what Panda Doc is

345
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,699
I'm sorry let me sweeten the deal I got

346
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,500
a black hat python book for anybody that

347
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,660
knows what pentadoc is

348
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,940
yes sir

349
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,800
uh close enough here come actually

350
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,779
I'll leave this over here for you

351
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:10,920
good job

352
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,459
all right so a little Panda doc right

353
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,600
it's a site used to create share track

354
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,120
documents right so maybe I wanted to

355
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,339
create an invoice well I could use Penta

356
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,740
dot create it and then send it or send a

357
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,899
link to them and have them go inside it

358
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,519
kind of like what we see in the bottom

359
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,459
left-hand corner of those two photos or

360
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,279
maybe I want to have a form where people

361
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,380
are filling out information or whatever

362
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,600
the case most people when they think of

363
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,639
developing the form or they do it in

364
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,320
word and leave it as something that you

365
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,420
can change okay that's not you all I

366
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,220
know or you might use something like

367
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,800
Adobe or whatever the case pentadoc is

368
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,720
another method to be able to do that and

369
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,399
it's online so that way you don't have

370
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,839
to download it send it all the other

371
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,720
good stuff it's a great platform right

372
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,459
um they do great stuff

373
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,139
but people are loading documents that

374
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,180
are laced with other things up there

375
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,120
right all methods to bypass filters and

376
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,180
things that are in place so cool now

377
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,980
that we've diverted from our originally

378
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,740
programmed station let's go back

379
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,180
right because now we see that

380
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,300
um that that email when decrypted

381
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,760
really is pointed to Panda doc that

382
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,120
document no longer exists cool so what

383
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,579
do we do right and this is me pretty

384
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,199
much throughout the day actually I

385
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,699
typically have a pencil in my hand or

386
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,380
something and I'm doodling and drawing

387
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,440
like ponies and stuff like that all

388
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,120
right or playing Tic-Tac-Toe by myself

389
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,639
nonetheless

390
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
um well let's look at the data right you

391
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
start looking at other things that we

392
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,019
have on you know either known systems

393
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,699
there was like one or two people that

394
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,199
self-reported blessed their heart and

395
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,579
then there was other people like nah I

396
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,100
didn't touch it and I'm like

397
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,220
it says right here you did

398
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,839
all right so we start looking at the

399
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,199
data right and looking at the data we

400
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,419
see that this person they actually

401
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,720
received the email twice they received

402
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,220
it once because they're part of the

403
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,679
managers group they also received it

404
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,540
again because they're part of payroll

405
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,000
and looking at the time stamps they're

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,579
fairly close to each other roughly

407
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,099
within a minute all right which homeboy

408
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,079
did not try to really stagger it out he

409
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,160
kind of just launched at will now from

410
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,140
there we see a number of things that

411
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,260
talk to o365 well because this is him

412
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,120
interacting with the message going

413
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
through that process to be able to

414
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,760
decrypt it but nonetheless ultimately we

415
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,400
see where the person went to Panda Doc

416
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,760
and when we're following the chain is we

417
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,640
have available evidence we see shortly

418
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,280
after that that they're going to a site

419
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,160
that's redacted now but looks kind of

420
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,260
weird Office 365

421
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,140
of dictation

422
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,940
updation right

423
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,020
um I tried to look at one of the YouTube

424
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,280
videos and make sure I was saying it

425
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,260
right because you know I wanna say it

426
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,240
right but nonetheless uh it looked weird

427
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,760
so it's like well what is this

428
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,000
we'll we'll go check it out right

429
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,419
um and you would guess that by this time

430
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,700
um that site no longer what the site

431
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,280
existed however that page no longer

432
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,620
existed right all this activity was

433
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,240
happening on February 4th uh roughly

434
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,020
about two something uh local EST if you

435
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,120
will and then by the time we got

436
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,360
involved it was middle to late February

437
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,059
all right so this campaign this piece of

438
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,100
the campaign had already subsided and

439
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,740
homeboy had moved on to the next part

440
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,200
um cool so it doesn't exist we're a

441
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,059
little bit further ahead we go back to

442
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,580
the draw dry erase board I finished my

443
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,679
game with tic-tac-toe by myself at this

444
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,419
point and then

445
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,640
um what else can we do

446
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,120
well there's this site called URL scan

447
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,100
actually let's go back anybody know what

448
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,260
URL scan let's sweeten the question here

449
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,820
I got a

450
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,000
let's see here I got a smart key logger

451
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,460
by keycroc anybody know what URL scan is

452
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,059
yes

453
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,720
that's for you

454
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,460
good job

455
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,320
I didn't mean to cut you off you were

456
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,059
absolutely right

457
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,500
I just didn't want you to go in a

458
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,700
different direction that would make you

459
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,539
absolutely wrong

460
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,020
all right so cool so you know URL scan

461
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,780
now this isn't what you know my team and

462
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,140
I use as our Full Source right but just

463
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,760
like the organizations you work in

464
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,620
there's some things that you use that

465
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,360
are publicly available and then there

466
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,620
are some things that are some Secret

467
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Sauce that you use internally right so I

468
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,840
want to give you the piece that you can

469
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,900
use today not telling you what we use

470
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,940
that you can't have access to or you'll

471
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,679
never see right that doesn't make any

472
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,120
sense and it does nothing good for you

473
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,679
so anyway URL scan developed 2016 a

474
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,740
service certainly that we can scan sites

475
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,679
and do some analysis all in an automated

476
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,280
fashion free in nature however there's

477
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,039
some restrictions associated with the

478
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,080
free version if you will there's a

479
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,299
commercially available aspect of this as

480
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,640
well it captures things like domains and

481
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,460
IPS and the resources I think one of the

482
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,200
big things that it does that's super

483
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,780
helpful for us is it captures a screen

484
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,679
screenshot of that page for us all right

485
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,960
so the other thing associated with it is

486
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,419
if deemed malicious there'll be a thing

487
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,039
up there that says malicious now I'm not

488
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,820
going to take that to full heart however

489
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,740
it could be helpful but certainly not a

490
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,880
Smoking Gun

491
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,360
so given that we tried to look at the

492
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,980
URL in this platform and luckily is luck

493
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,780
with habit somebody had already

494
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,980
submitted this URL earlier now earlier

495
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,140
in my slides I think it was somewhere

496
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,039
around like 225 right which would have

497
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,400
been like 725 UTC that's about the point

498
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,140
where those emails started to go out in

499
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,900
the organization well almost at eight

500
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,880
o'clock UTC that time somebody had

501
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,179
submitted the URL the site or excuse me

502
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,640
the document on Panda doc was still up

503
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,980
so they were able to get a screenshot of

504
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,500
it all right so we see the URL

505
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,200
associated with the pendant dock piece

506
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,799
with the URI we also see that time stamp

507
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,020
showing when somebody submitted it and

508
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,940
then in the bottom right hand corner we

509
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,460
see what data a screenshot of the data

510
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,280
that was being housed at that time

511
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,620
now mind you when my team and I go out

512
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,659
there it no longer exists at that at

513
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,360
this moment however we know as of

514
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,820
roughly eight o'clock on that day it

515
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,580
still existed and it's cool now we see

516
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,460
this screenshot and you know we're like

517
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,980
well what is that it obviously looks

518
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,480
different than that other image that I

519
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,980
showed you because again it had nothing

520
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,679
to do with it but when we start to blow

521
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,760
that up

522
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,039
we see this right you receive two

523
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,380
documents really some other data that

524
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,059
doesn't really mean anything but if

525
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,039
you're a user you're like oh okay yeah

526
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,919
it's John Doe send me a document we're

527
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,200
used to him doing random stuff or

528
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,100
whatever so this is still uh for us now

529
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,280
in the top left hand corner there's a

530
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,380
piece where the document actually

531
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,700
depicts

532
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,580
um who it was generated by and if you

533
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,520
can't see that it actually says it says

534
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
John Doe because I wrote it but it says

535
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,539
the actual person's name who were

536
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,740
already tracking if you will so cool

537
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,919
now we're a little bit further ahead we

538
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,799
see that the person's using encrypted

539
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,140
messages they're using Penta docs from

540
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,620
pentadox some way it is making its way

541
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,520
to uh that one site that's redacted

542
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,880
office 365. so we still have a little

543
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,500
bit more to go

544
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,340
now looking back at that main Panda dock

545
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,860
piece where we have highlighted up top

546
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,100
the URL in the time there's also a

547
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,380
category where it will retrieve the

548
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,039
links so at the time that the page was

549
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,900
submitted roughly about eight o'clock

550
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,940
and it still existed

551
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,600
the links associated with that Panda doc

552
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,220
document actually went to a site that's

553
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,980
also redacted that has essentially

554
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,760
almost the same URI right different site

555
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,559
same URI

556
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,039
uh or excuse me the sorry the same site

557
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,780
that we saw in the logs right so cool we

558
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,000
see that how the system got from Office

559
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,179
365 Panda doc that 0365 urri we now can

560
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,280
tie how it made it there well somehow

561
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,380
some weight in that Panda doc document

562
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,780
it linked there we don't have the actual

563
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,880
Panda document to be able to fully

564
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,220
confirm that analysis however at the

565
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,880
time of this submission the link had a

566
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,220
link pointed to it all right cool well

567
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,380
let's go out there as you recall a

568
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,179
couple of slides ago we did try to go

569
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,340
out there and it didn't exist now

570
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,919
there's a couple of methods we could

571
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,100
utilize to uh try to see what existed at

572
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,140
that time

573
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,640
but for the sake of what we're doing now

574
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,440
let's say that none of those methods

575
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,299
work

576
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,860
so

577
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,240
we look at it from another perspective

578
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,400
where we're looking at

579
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,620
what else was pointed to that one site

580
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,260
that no longer existed not the pentadox

581
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,179
site the other site that no longer

582
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,380
existed the 0365 and then reversing that

583
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,679
we found a different Panda doc link that

584
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,960
was pointed to it

585
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,059
and what do we know

586
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,640
it was actually submitted at nine

587
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,220
o'clock on the same day right so this

588
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,880
guy is very active that day he's not

589
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,159
reusing certain domains and stuff but

590
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,559
his ttps are not shifting so now that we

591
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,500
kind of figured that out and guess what

592
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,700
it too has the same document so he's

593
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,559
uploaded two different Panda doc

594
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,080
documents and both of them

595
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,419
um pointed to similar sites if not the

596
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,840
same site

597
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,659
now from this perspective we recognize

598
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,240
this guy is still active even though

599
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,400
we're coming in a couple weeks after the

600
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,600
fact and we have yet a different Panda

601
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,419
doc link it costs them nothing right

602
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,100
they use the free version they create a

603
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,140
document they lace it and then they're

604
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,480
good to go if it stays up there an hour

605
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,480
and gets 20 people cool if it stays

606
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,200
longer cool as well now here

607
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,539
right nine o'clock

608
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,860
we see the links and this link that is

609
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,799
actually redirected to is different from

610
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,440
the very first one but the tactic is

611
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,500
still the same just off of the URI if

612
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,860
you will but guess what when we look at

613
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,700
that actual site it was still up

614
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,220
so we're able to see something that we

615
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
didn't have the ability to see before

616
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,440
what is actually being housed there and

617
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,080
you would guess it it's a fake o365

618
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,740
login right now the other aspect to this

619
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,779
is what's behind it looks kind of

620
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,700
blurred out and you may be thinking or

621
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,100
some people thought well if I log in

622
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,919
I'll be able to see the real data right

623
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,380
this is a lot to go through for John Doe

624
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,880
the guy that works at your organization

625
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,860
maybe a little bit senior up like it's

626
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,299
like a

627
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,279
a Chase if you will

628
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,340
nonetheless looking at it I was very

629
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,600
interested in like well what is it

630
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,159
blurred out not like it was really going

631
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,659
to show it to me for real but it's like

632
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,880
created tax invoice no payment schedule

633
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,620
it's like all right well that's kind of

634
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,760
interesting but uh at this point it's

635
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,240
certainly fishing right uh Panda doc to

636
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
a random site that was likely

637
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,400
compromised that's now housing this data

638
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,140
that's going to harvest and collect

639
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,720
credentials uh super interested in the

640
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,120
method in which it does so I go to log

641
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,880
in with my email of course TomTom

642
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,940
outlook.com and that's what's happening

643
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,159
on the left hand side on the right hand

644
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,640
side I fire up burp we intercept that

645
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,140
traffic and I want to see what's

646
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,840
actually being sent so in doing so

647
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,880
logging in this TomTom

648
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,720
we see the URI and essentially it's a

649
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,480
post request that's being done and down

650
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,360
at the bottom I see that my creds are

651
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,000
being posted to a another URI called

652
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,220
next.php we see that at the top and one

653
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,340
highlighted in red or circled in red

654
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,000
okay so dudes harvesting credits okay

655
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,159
got it now I'm really interested because

656
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,679
we want to know how does this full thing

657
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,320
work how does this ecosystem of sorts

658
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,600
continue

659
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
well aside from grabbing those crates he

660
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,500
sends it to this next.php we look at the

661
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,039
page Source right and it's JavaScript in

662
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,020
there so really looking at a couple of

663
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,419
things highlighted here and I can barely

664
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,240
see from up here so let me go over here

665
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,400
um the the first one we see that they're

666
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,020
returning things like the position of

667
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,640
the AD Sign and then they're coming

668
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,960
through and they're trying to

669
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,179
essentially split

670
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,600
um the domain versus the username and

671
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,100
then coming through and trying to get

672
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,140
the actual domain name and what's

673
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,620
interesting here is you got this base64

674
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,340
piece right so decoding that that

675
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,760
actually decodes to next dot PHP it's

676
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,159
like oh okay well we already know that's

677
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,200
going to be important here in a second

678
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,779
and then you know looking at the actual

679
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,720
uh or noting the actual email supplied

680
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,539
by the user and the password

681
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,059
um associated with it we then see that

682
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,980
the email and the user information is

683
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,860
being stored to a new variable uh and

684
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,140
then you know we have some regex here

685
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,840
this is looking for an actual email

686
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,500
address looking in that specific format

687
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,840
and then we're checking to see if

688
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,419
anything was received in the actual

689
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,899
field so somebody made it to that front

690
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:03,240
0365 page did they actually put any

691
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,720
credentials in from there trying to

692
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,760
check if the credentials that were

693
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,919
supplied actually fits the structure of

694
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,159
an email or at least the username and

695
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,860
then lastly checking to see if a

696
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,279
password was input now of this uh code

697
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,779
it's kind of interesting because what I

698
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,039
didn't have highlighted here and there's

699
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,260
another screen with some more stuff

700
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,419
homeboy is like writing but he's

701
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,520
commenting out code and then there's a

702
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
spot in here a number of spots where

703
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,820
he's got things misspelled he doesn't

704
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,220
care because it works

705
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,860
all right so from this perspective same

706
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,600
thing where he's doing some slicing

707
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,419
associated with the the domain and then

708
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,880
what's interesting here uh this third

709
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,580
one I have highlighted is

710
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,500
no matter what username and password you

711
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,480
put in the first time it's going to

712
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
error out saying it's incorrect and then

713
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,520
you're gonna well somebody's natural

714
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,460
reaction that part excuse me uh

715
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,200
somebody's natural reaction is oh well

716
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,480
let me put it in again and after you put

717
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,000
it in again it's going to error out but

718
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,159
at that point it's then going to

719
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,640
redirect you to the real logon page if

720
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,880
you put in Nando at outlook.com

721
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,820
twice after that it would then redirect

722
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,880
you to the real Outlook page right so

723
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
he's trying to harvest he or she is

724
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,899
trying to harvest credentials of the

725
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,820
same user either from the perspective to

726
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,220
do a confirmation or in case they try to

727
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,860
log on with two different accounts and

728
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,779
that's what's happening on this fourth

729
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,039
one as well all right so uh you know not

730
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,200
very

731
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,700
you would think it would be more than

732
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,779
this but I was trying to find the

733
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,460
misspelling in there it's like verify

734
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,159
without a y is one of them that comes up

735
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,480
but

736
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,899
so that's next. or excuse me so that's

737
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,600
the the main JavaScript and we note in

738
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,659
there that there was base64 that talked

739
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:01,740
about next.php well here's the next.php

740
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,360
um for any actor that's out there you

741
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,340
got to secure your infrastructure right

742
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,600
like we shouldn't be able to get this

743
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,700
far in your uh your stuff but

744
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,399
nonetheless

745
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,640
next.php receives those credentials and

746
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,140
then you'll see that there's an include

747
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,059
statement this is PHP at this point

748
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,940
where it's going to essentially read in

749
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,880
Make available uh email dot PHP and this

750
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,240
is going to be on the server side

751
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,279
email.php is going to contain the actual

752
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,580
email address to sin said credentials

753
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,200
the other thing it's going to actually

754
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,980
send is not only the credentials but the

755
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,140
IP address associated with the machine

756
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,559
in which the user attempted to quote

757
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,039
unquote log in if you will it then tries

758
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,380
to get the geolocation of that at and it

759
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,799
utilizes a built-in function of PHP mail

760
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
essentially to then mail those

761
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,419
credentials

762
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,580
so I couldn't get to the next piece the

763
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,679
email PHP or I couldn't get to the point

764
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,760
where I could

765
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,039
get it into brief but

766
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,640
um

767
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,159
nonetheless looking back and really

768
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,880
highlighting this full timeline right so

769
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,000
encrypted emails are sent emails are

770
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
decrypted

771
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,960
pentadoc URL is visited

772
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,360
whatever site of their choosing that's

773
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,919
laced in that pentadoc document is then

774
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,919
having that user redirected to it the

775
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,899
user is inputting their creds those

776
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,980
creds are harvested and sent off so

777
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,260
looking at this right we talk about and

778
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,700
hopefully you went to David's talk

779
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,380
earlier right but the Pyramid of pain

780
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,260
changing things like the IP addresses or

781
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,539
the the websites the domains essentially

782
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,340
in which they're forwarding that

783
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,200
information or the penta dot document

784
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,480
all that stuff is easy right really

785
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,340
what's not changing with homeboy and I

786
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,980
like to call them homeboy is uh the ttps

787
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,659
his ttps remains and he or she well you

788
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,059
guessed it right they're still doing it

789
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,019
today

790
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,080
uh but at the time we were able to tie

791
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,760
back and then we stopped at this point

792
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,739
because it became

793
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,520
not even fun a number of sites tied to

794
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,980
to this actor right a subset of actors

795
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,320
right and a lot of it was based upon

796
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,540
redirection from Panda doc because

797
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,460
there's a lot of that going on but

798
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,099
they're utilizing the same URI and then

799
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,040
the identical web page was the same as

800
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,359
well every now and then we would find

801
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,940
small deviations But ultimately would

802
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,159
tie back to what we would assess is the

803
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,219
the same actor here's a number of

804
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,500
roughly 12 to 15 sites that were the

805
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,320
same at the time and there's no shortage

806
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,800
of them and really within the last two

807
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,560
weeks they're still up to these Antics

808
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,320
right so we see that site there and this

809
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,440
was roughly two weeks ago so uh did have

810
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,300
this hasn't changed it's not going to

811
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,040
change because it continues to work

812
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,880
we've had conversations with panda doc

813
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,099
they're very forthcoming and certainly

814
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,180
great a great organization

815
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,640
but you know they they're working

816
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,920
through some things as well and this is

817
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,780
going to continue to be a tactic that's

818
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,599
going to be used so knowing that this is

819
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,880
still being used today

820
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,920
you know what are some things that could

821
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,119
have helped

822
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,940
you know maybe that organization at the

823
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,940
time this is not an all-inclusive list

824
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,700
of things to do to you know prevent

825
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,859
fission I'm only speaking to that

826
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,560
organization at that time in that space

827
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,140
and what we were brought in to really

828
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,260
address right education is education is

829
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,000
education that's always going to be

830
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
number one however you might not have

831
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,800
noticed and one of the screenshots they

832
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,320
have proof point that was their email

833
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,520
filtering platform

834
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,859
it was implemented in such a way almost

835
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,160
like a firewall that's turned on but

836
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,859
doesn't have any rules applied right so

837
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,320
if if they were being inspected they

838
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,640
might have passed I have an email

839
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,220
filtering platform but it wasn't

840
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,800
actually doing anything so optimal

841
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,800
configuration was needed validation and

842
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,800
even then there's some concern that it

843
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,260
may not have picked up the first piece

844
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,480
but possibly would have picked up other

845
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,060
aspects

846
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,060
uh while Company B they're not tied to

847
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,260
the investigation that we were brought

848
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,700
in to do that's a different tenant

849
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,440
that's a different organization so

850
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,359
really how did they get their initial

851
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,220
compromise I don't know it could be one

852
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,740
of a million things however

853
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,320
um be it that that that is a different

854
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,619
tenant it's an M365 tenant I would

855
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,619
assess that that initial compromise was

856
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,500
through that tenant I'd also assess that

857
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,380
it probably was a spray in pray don't

858
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,079
know for real but things like Azure

859
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,119
active duty password protection right

860
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,220
having things like that enabled and the

861
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,660
organization that we were investigating

862
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,400
they did not have that enabled if you're

863
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,260
not familiar with that that really

864
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,380
starts to prevent the use of weak

865
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,520
passwords

866
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,440
spray and pray could still work but

867
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,359
let's not make it easy where it's like

868
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,400
password One Two Three or like seasons

869
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,040
and things of that nature

870
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,660
the organization

871
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,300
is noted they allowed any and everybody

872
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,200
to send emails to their organizational

873
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,780
wide distro lists from the outside

874
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,740
should not happen right and when we look

875
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,380
at it it was a very

876
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,480
it was they were in such a place where

877
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,400
there was lots of room for opportunity

878
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,220
right so as we could see it's a bad

879
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,140
example to be able to do that now I get

880
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,720
it maybe individual email or excuse me

881
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,119
uh distro list with smaller people but

882
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,359
not allowing somebody from the outside

883
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,460
to send an email that can reach the

884
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,160
whole organization so certainly

885
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,200
recommend against that MFA can't say

886
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,180
that enough even though there's certain

887
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,400
issues with it they did not have MFA

888
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,820
enabled and then as we were leaving

889
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,579
recommended that they do MFA and they

890
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,800
were allowing MFA registration from

891
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,140
anywhere right so we've seen in the past

892
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,560
where an actor is already in the network

893
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,320
the organization seeks to enable MFA and

894
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,740
the actor just you know registers MFA

895
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,200
from their own space or somewhere else

896
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,820
out in the world so you really didn't

897
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,740
impact them because they still have

898
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,180
access so when this organization

899
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,820
um was seeking to enable MFA based upon

900
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,680
the recommendation certainly we want

901
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,660
them to enable it and have people

902
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,420
register from their own trusted IP space

903
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,920
there are some concerns there but let's

904
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,980
lessen the tax service associated with

905
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,980
it and given that that really brings me

906
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,859
to the end of what I have

907
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,680
um I'll have this brief up sometime

908
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,839
today if you want to chat there's my

909
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,359
email I did some coding every now and

910
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,280
then there's my GitHub and if you want

911
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,560
to just connect there I am but if

912
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
there's any questions I'll take one or

913
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
two if not I'll hang around for a little

914
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,900
bit

915
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,079
foreign

916
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,460
yeah so good question the question was

917
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,980
did MFA resolve the issue so we were

918
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,960
only focused on

919
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,780
the one organization that was receiving

920
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,780
the emails not the organization that was

921
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,839
sending them the MFA piece although the

922
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,640
organization that was receiving it it

923
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,079
wouldn't have made any difference

924
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
however we certainly would recommend it

925
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,420
in case somebody did complete the full

926
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,780
process of going to that site supplying

927
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,300
their credentials now allowing a

928
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,740
potential actor to get back in that

929
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,420
Network we would certainly want to have

930
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,339
something in place where MFA would have

931
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,960
at least triggered and made it a little

932
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,240
bit more difficult I also note MFA

933
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,079
because I I feel fairly confident that

934
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,940
the organization in which the emails

935
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,859
originated from did not have something

936
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,540
like that in place again I won't say

937
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,339
that's a full you know

938
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,920
feature that will stop everything

939
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,960
but any little speed bump we can put in

940
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,820
place that could potentially illuminate

941
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,800
and and highlight you know malicious

942
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,540
activity is great so hopefully that

943
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,500
answers your question yes

944
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,880
correct

945
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,280
yeah so good point so because he was

946
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,359
only using the the affected uh

947
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,220
organization's tenant

948
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,980
the one that was impacted

949
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,560
his account had been disabled for some

950
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,660
time because of lack of use and at the

951
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,700
time of the investigation it was still

952
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,359
disabled

953
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,880
yeah yeah very good question so you know

954
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,700
in my day job is an incident responder I

955
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,980
respond to an incident I tell you what

956
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,780
happened I write a report and then I

957
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,640
move on to the next one so there's some

958
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,040
organizations that literally don't have

959
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,220
the right people in place to understand

960
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,660
they're told to go to the cloud because

961
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,000
it's cost effective and as long as it

962
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,800
works they think they're good right and

963
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
then there's other organizations where

964
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,339
there's competing requirements and

965
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,740
there's funding or you know something

966
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,359
else that's impeding or they're going to

967
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,339
get to it in the next quarter all right

968
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,839
so there's always a chance that

969
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,480
organizations are taken there's also a

970
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,640
group of people who have some technology

971
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,440
that could illuminate some of this

972
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,480
activity but they don't have the

973
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,160
necessary checks and balances in place

974
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,960
to highlight when

975
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,180
that technology is no longer in place in

976
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,160
working case in point you might have

977
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,560
some type of endpoint solution agent

978
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
that's on all your machines if that

979
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,359
thing stops checking in not having the

980
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,920
ability to identify that is stop

981
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,260
checking in and investigate it is just

982
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,480
as bad as essentially it not being there

983
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,640
from the very beginning which we see

984
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,220
actives get on there and disable

985
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,660
endpoint Security Solutions all the time

986
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
sir

987
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,880
I think it depends on the the situation

988
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
um so rewriting to then you know funnel

989
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,280
it through some other platform I think

990
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,920
is certainly useful uh in this case they

991
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,599
were like Bare Bones they were one of

992
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,220
these organizations where they were told

993
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,819
to go to the cloud the cloud admin

994
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,700
is like the network admin is you know

995
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,380
somebody else but yeah I think certainly

996
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,020
the URL rewrites the time into place for

997
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,680
it for sure

998
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,260
that's fair I could see that approach

999
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,020
almost like a young child right like I

1000
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,700
could educate them and say don't touch

1001
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,200
the stove but I need to have preventive

1002
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,460
measures in place to ensure that they

1003
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,500
don't get to the stove problem with that

1004
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,619
is our technology will have gaps as well

1005
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,240
so it's sometimes like the chicken and

1006
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,180
egg I certainly agree with you know that

1007
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,920
as an approach as well maybe both of

1008
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,780
them are just as equally important I

1009
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,619
appreciate that thought

1010
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,900
sir last one

1011
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,700
yeah so if I think I understand

1012
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,800
um we were talking about setting up MFA

1013
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,400
with geo location or geofencing to where

1014
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,640
foreign

1015
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,099
well I mean you could do it by IP subnet

1016
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:32,160
to say you know company trusted space as

1017
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,920
opposed to it you know pushing or

1018
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,859
actually don't use push but uh retrieve

1019
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,859
it if you will from a different uh IP

1020
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,300
space yeah there's a couple of things

1021
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,900
that could be done

1022
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,900
yeah yeah absolutely

1023
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,300
yes and I wouldn't use push right I mean

1024
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,359
we just seen in the last two weeks uh

1025
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:09,660
another example where uh pushing it

1026
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,660
could be bad but yeah to your point uh

1027
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,079
there's a method to not necessarily say

1028
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:18,000
you know this location per se but you

1029
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,460
can lower it down to IP space that would

1030
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,339
put it in a otherwise trusted IP space

1031
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,578
foreign

1032
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,940
I would want them in the internal subnet

1033
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,420
space and where applicables if you can

1034
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,099
see them that's cool but in this day and

1035
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:54,540
age that's going to be much harder but

1036
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,900
if they're VPN and to internal space

1037
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,020
that's that's a method as well yeah

1038
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,540
yeah good questions okay all right

1039
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,859
everybody thanks for joining certainly

1040
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,400
appreciate it
