00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,640
yeah that was my first Chick-fil-A

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,220
Sandwich I've been in a different place

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,199
in this world so I couldn't go but

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
couldn't have they were pretty damn good

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,400
pretty damn good and we're thrilled that

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,840
you're gonna be here with us for the

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,000
next hour or so

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,360
um we do have some prizes to give away

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,700
we have four prizes for those of you

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,100
that ask great questions and participate

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,860
with us also Griffin and I like doing

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,739
things that are interactive so uh we

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,960
need you if you want to play along get

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,879
out your phone get out your laptop

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
you're gonna need the Internet because

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,000
the reality is that I could stand up in

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,579
here and teach you about things on

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,120
slides I could talk to you about how you

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,159
need to learn by taking training or

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,740
doing other stuff but that's not fun

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,380
what if we did things a little

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,299
differently that's what we're going to

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,400
focus on in the next couple minutes

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,260
Okay so

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,360
we start out with a challenge this is an

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,619
ocean talk we want to give you an ocean

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,780
challenge what we're not going to give

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,780
you is any help any hints any clues any

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,360
knowledge or anything like that so you

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,979
may already possess what it takes to

34
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,360
solve this Challenge and that's great

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,460
you may not so you might have to go and

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,780
see if you can figure it out we're going

37
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,299
to give you 60 seconds to do it in a

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,100
second here three words are going to

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,680
appear in that red box on the screen

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
there's a structure that correlates with

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,460
a location that are related to those

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,560
three words okay those three words will

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,939
take you to a place in the world if you

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,979
know what to do and at that place in the

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,780
world there's a structure we want the

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,259
name of that structure in 60 Seconds

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,200
and when you when you know that name of

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,299
that structure yell it out the first two

49
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,880
people to yell it out actually will get

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,920
prizes now of course that means you

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,360
don't actually have to do any of this

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,340
you just have to be the first one to cat

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,739
copy what the first person says and the

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,959
second place person will absolutely be

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,000
fine you ready yes let's do this here we

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,360
go 60 seconds Starts Now where is this

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,660
location

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,540
uh yeah that might be good

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,540
nice

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,220
and we've got some lock picks for you

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,040
young man here we go well done very very

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
good 15 seconds

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,220
that's great now for those of you that

64
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,840
are wondering what the heck just

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,160
happened

66
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,720
um we're gonna reveal this to you but

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,019
what we need you to do is think about uh

68
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,819
I'll take this this is fun

69
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,019
okay

70
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,060
so think about your experience that just

71
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,860
happened right there okay when we told

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,720
you that this was the challenge you were

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,620
gonna have to work with these three

74
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,180
words I saw a whole bunch of people

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,560
right away light up grab their phone

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,180
grab their laptop they know what to do

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,040
okay and then I saw a whole bunch of

78
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,239
other people that are just looking at me

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,700
like what three words what does that

80
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,760
mean I don't understand so did you know

81
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,800
what to do instinctively right off the

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,239
bat did you have the knowledge already

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,920
coming into the challenge in order to be

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,480
able to be successful

85
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
how did that make you feel if you didn't

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,940
okay a lot of competitive people in this

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,379
room I'm assuming right we all like to

88
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,060
compete and win

89
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,280
did that motivate you or demotivate you

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,959
that you felt like either you were

91
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,840
adequate or inadequate in your knowledge

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,360
did you learn anything or were you even

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,940
able to learn anything in the 15 seconds

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,680
that it took someone else to solve it

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,540
who had the knowledge maybe not

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,860
oh it was true that was the Eiffel Tower

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,280
and how do I know because we made the

98
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,540
slides and I'll show you in just a

99
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,819
moment all right

100
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,159
very good so

101
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
some of you had the knowledge and some

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
of you did not but for those of you that

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,620
did not could you have solved it if we

104
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,599
gave you some hints so I'm going to show

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,459
you a couple of hints here

106
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,439
the first one would be the logo up on

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,239
the screen those slashes inside that red

108
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,000
box is a logo that you would have needed

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,220
to know how to solve this challenge if

110
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,839
you didn't already know

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,340
some of you are probably thinking right

112
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,680
now okay I can take that logo I can go

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
work with it I know what to do

114
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,940
here's another hint if the three slashes

115
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,500
aren't familiar maybe a site like

116
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,199
symbols.com can tell you what they mean

117
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,940
so now another group of you all of a

118
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,259
sudden leveled up and said you know what

119
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,060
I think I could figure it out from here

120
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,639
to find the correct location the correct

121
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,199
geographic location you have to be

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,600
precise with your spelling so those

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,580
exact three words exactly how we spelled

124
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,100
them would have led you to the Eiffel

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,979
Tower in Paris France if you know that a

126
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,320
site called what three words has mapped

127
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,300
out the world in three meter squares and

128
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,979
each one of those three meter squares

129
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,979
has an individual con uh connection

130
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,500
between three specific words in a

131
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,639
certain order

132
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,860
they don't repeat anywhere else and you

133
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,419
can use those three words to Lead

134
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,580
somebody to a three meter spot anywhere

135
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,259
in the world

136
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,560
congratulations you just completed a

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,780

okay so and the point is some of you

142
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,419
also gained some knowledge because not

143
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,979
everybody in the room knew right off the

144
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,120
bat that they were going to be able to

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
solve that challenge but now every one

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,180
of you knows how to do that or at least

147

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,580
so we take the skills that we're going

169
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,259
to talk about learning in this talk

170
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,479
today and somebody like myself or the

171
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,280
people on my team put them to work to

172
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,639
help find Predators or victims of crimes

173
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,780
against children

174
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,720
and I have a history in cyber security I

175
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,819
grew up doing b-sides up in the

176
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,300
Washington DC area all around and I love

177
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,460
cyber security and and the infosec

178
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,100
community I've been around for a while I

179
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,840
wrote a Sans class on open source

180
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,819
intelligence I taught web app pen

181
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,340
testing and I really found myself

182
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,560
gravitating more towards open source

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,139
intelligence or stalking people odds

184
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,620
researching people online and when I was

185
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,479
doing that I was like you know we can

186
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,699
teach this we can help people learn how

187
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,100
to do this because the techniques unlike

188
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,080
many of the Cyber techniques where you

189
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,180
might need an advanced degree in what

190
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,340
the heck

191
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,919
802.16 is and how it propagates through

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,340
metal versus wood innocent it's looking

193
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,099
at social media it's looking at things

194
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,380
that you and I do every day and so what

195
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,300
I did was I created the myosync training

196
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,120
company the ocean games company and uh

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,039
Griffin has helped me out with some of

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,800
those things but let's uh let's talk a

199
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
little bit about what you're going to be

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
able to get out of this talk first off

201
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,599
we're going to be talking about what is

202
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,220
Ocean's a little bit deeper because I

203
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,020
know that this is info second I know

204
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,000
that many of you probably already used

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,039
osin in your work whether you're

206
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,340
offensive defensive or somebody else

207
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,680
that's not even in cyber you're doing

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,660
open source intelligence you just don't

209
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,000
know it yet also we're going to be

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,860
talking about gamification how do you

211
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,560
make learning fun who here has ever sat

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
in a class and you're like I can't wait

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,479
for this thing to to end what the heck

214
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,639
is this guy talking about oh I could

215
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,460
teach this yeah that's not fun that's

216
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,259
not a way to learn that's a way to go to

217
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,479
sleep and that's not what we're here to

218
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,860
show you we're here to show you that

219
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,319
learning can be fun all you need to do

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,479
is find the places to do it

221
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,580
also through the years of teaching

222
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,039
either Sans classes or other classes

223
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,800
Griffin and I figured out that people

224
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,620
learn in different ways I know right

225
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,899
it's weird but you know if you're a

226
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,000
visual learner or a person that likes

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
that do things with your hands like

228
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,479
assemble Badges and what we're going to

229
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,420
do is we're going to help point you at

230
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,700
those types of online challenges that

231
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,100
might be right for you all right and

232
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,360
we'll show you where these challenges

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,320
are

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,120
okay so another challenge

235
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,200
oh sorry that's mine that's yeah that's

236
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,580
your cue we'll get this figured out

237
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,399
we'll get this one okay so in the rest

238
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,080
of the slides throughout this deck we've

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,360
hidden three words okay they correlate

240
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,160
to a monument now all of you should know

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,500
what that means if you see a word that

242
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
has red text and those three slashes in

243
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
front of it they might not always be

244
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,240
obvious but that's going to be one of

245
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,279
the three words that are clues that will

246
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,320
lead you to the Vic the location by the

247
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,500
way that's not one of the words okay

248
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,580
obviously we've experienced this before

249
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,560
they are not in the correct order so

250
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,820
you're going to get three words and you

251
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,440
have to try some combinations figure out

252
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,060
what the correct order is

253
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,519
and when you get that

254
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,260
go ahead and tweet it to us with that

255
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,459
hashtag

256
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,680
ocean games Augusta and the winner

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,920
whoever tweets to us first we will reply

258
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,459
to your Tweet and say great job so big

259
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,060
big money on the line now the reality is

260
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,920
is that you know we're talking about oh

261
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,740
sent here at a cyber conference and uh

262
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,420
set conference but

263
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,940
like I said the world of Open Source

264
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,580
intelligence or ocean is one that you've

265
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,920
been in for probably decades and you

266
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
didn't even know it many of you use the

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,440
same skills to find things to research

268
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,320
people to research products to look up

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,080
who's doing what and what we do like

270
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Griffin said is we find people

271
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,120
and we do that with a certain goal in

272
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,160
mind hey this person is exploiting other

273
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,260
people let's find where they live where

274
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,500
they work what they do oh this attacker

275
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,019
is hacking somebody let's research that

276
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,420
domain that their their uh their

277
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,300
information calls back to so there's

278
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,240
lots of ways that we actually use

279
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,040
um ocean skills in the world of cyber

280
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,200
and really I mean as an offensive

281
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,600
security person I used to do I used to

282
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,260
love doing recon on my targets and and

283
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,660
when I did I was amazed at what I found

284
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,820
one of part of our process before we'd

285
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,980
hack a website for a customer is we

286
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,620
would Google the name of the website and

287
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,940
when we Google the name of the website

288
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,399
you never knew what came back but if you

289
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,019
Google properly you could find some

290
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,899
really cool stuff like one time I found

291
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,140
this this help document who here reads

292
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,260
help documents yeah oh look at you all

293
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,540
reading the manual yeah yeah the funny

294
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,360
manual um yeah so you read the help

295
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,740
document and I'm reading the help

296
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,480
document and my buddies are telling me

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,980
hey Micah we need to be scanning this

298
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,600
host we need to be exploiting I'm like

299
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,060
whoa whoa whoa there Cowboy let's just

300
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
read the manual so I read the manual

301
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
sure enough on like page three it said

302
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,620
if you want to log in to the application

303
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,079
that we were testing enter a username

304
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,260
like this and a password like that

305
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,019
so I went and I entered that username

306
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,540
entered that password and I was in my

307
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,220
buddies were like what exploit did you

308
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,579
use I'm like Google so there's a lot of

309
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,940
power in these tools we are sharing so

310
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,399
much data intentionally and

311
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,680
unintentionally on the internet those of

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,660
us that know how to actually find that

313
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,440
are quite successful in our work now as

314
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,380
I mentioned you probably have done some

315
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,279
Googling or some mapping to get here

316
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,620
right how do you find out where to park

317
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,240
how do you find out where this location

318
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,839
is pictures of Mark Baggett looking like

319
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,180
a boss I mean these are things that

320
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,240
people are looking for and they

321
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,480
correlate to Ocean skills

322
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
I was looking to see if anybody would

323
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,779
take a picture of that no please don't

324
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,459
please

325
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,680
it is it is being tweeted to baguette

326
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,959
probably yes okay so let's talk about

327
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,380
gamification the science of gamification

328
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,320
you probably experienced gamification

329
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,180
all throughout your lives in different

330
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,860
ways and we want to talk about

331
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,959
gamification as it relates to learning

332
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,820
there's a number of different reasons

333
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,279
why it makes learning experiences better

334
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,160
how many people in here as part of their

335
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,839
job are tasked with training other

336
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,760
people

337
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,459
a lot of hands right so the traditional

338
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,320
way of training people is you prepare

339
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,820
your materials maybe you get some

340
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,139
walkthroughs you put everything together

341
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,260
in a logical order you uh lay it all out

342
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,180
in slides and you go and you present the

343
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,639
material okay and that's fine for some

344
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,079
people and they can learn that way and

345
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,399
they can see it and depending on your

346
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,720
presentation they might be able to

347
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,700
absorb that but other people just don't

348
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,279
quite learn that way okay some other

349
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,560
people might need a little bit more

350
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
Hands-On or they might need a little bit

351
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,579
more mental motivation maybe they need

352
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,180
some type of reward or uh you know the

353
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
motivation of achievement or things like

354
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,500
that gamification brings that into your

355
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,959
teaching so if you teach I would

356
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,339
encourage you to think about how to

357
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,440
gamify your learning we just taught all

358
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,480
of you how to find what three words and

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,760
use that to make a location that was fun

360
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,279
right okay better than us showing a

361
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,200
slide has what three words website on it

362
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,060
and telling you what it is it was a

363
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,339
challenge okay and everybody had that

364
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,260
experience together and when you

365
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,360
incorporate gamification into to your

366
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,700
teaching style or if you know that it's

367
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,260
part of a learning style that helps you

368
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,360
learn and you look for resources that

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,680
give that to you

370
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,899
you're resilient to failure because

371
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,600
failure in a gamified setting doesn't

372
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,700
feel as finite as failure in your day

373
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,940
job right it doesn't feel as as finite

374
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,560
as I just got out of that training class

375
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
and walked back over to my desk and I

376
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,380
couldn't do the thing that I was just

377
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,480
supposed to learn okay gamification

378
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,300
helps you fail forward

379
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,339
games can create an emotional connection

380
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,959
I'm going to show you an image here and

381
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,519
I want to know how many people have an

382
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,100
emotional connection to this image

383
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,980
a lot of people in the world right it's

384
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,240
Candy Crush

385
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
a lot of people have an emotional

386
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,779
connection to that game they have to get

387
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,100
in there they have to play it they have

388
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,260
to have the daily achievements okay

389
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,079
gamification hooks people in it makes it

390
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,420
fun and entertaining something like this

391
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,120
takes advantage of it and becomes a

392
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,220
worldwide sensation

393
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,480
okay

394
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,180
think about the psychological aspects of

395
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,519
gamification and how tangible it can

396
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,500
make the learning for you but then think

397
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,019
about your kids how many people in here

398
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,940
have children

399
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,399
okay how many of your children have a

400
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,220
tablet or a device with games okay right

401
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,500
and the kids love those things if

402
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
they're like my kid my four-year-old

403
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,339
would literally starve to death if I

404
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,600
gave him a tablet that was plugged in

405
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,420
and just walked away okay he wants to do

406
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,399
nothing but play those games and he's

407
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,260
learning I mean they learn colors they

408
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,760
learn shapes they learn how to do things

409
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,040
because that that learning is gamified

410
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,380
it's fun okay who would have thought

411
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,339
that learning could be fun

412
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,220
also from many many years of being in

413
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,380
the cyber world I know that there's lots

414
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,760
of different types of ways to learn

415
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,519
right we have captured the flags that

416
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,560
I've played at Derby con if you remember

417
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,579
Derby con at Defcon at other places and

418
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,880
I have almost not showered for three

419
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,639
days as I've been intensely focused on

420
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,380
getting the most points in a certain

421
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,240
game but I know that not everybody

422
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,399
learns that way and that's really not

423
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
motivated some people if you have a

424
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,699
crisis situation or you have one hour or

425
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,180
60 seconds to do something people rise

426
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,399
to the occasion especially if they're

427
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,019
bringing their existing knowledge to

428
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,540
Bear if you know about what three words

429
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,040
and we say we're going to give you three

430
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,839
words that represent the geographic

431
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,940
location you are going to be able to

432
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,920
better perform the tasks that we're

433
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,139
going to give you and so what we find is

434
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,060
that some of the educational experiences

435
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,800
some of those capture the flags that are

436
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,019
out there the people that are performing

437
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,180
best are the ones that are already

438
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,019
qualified to do those tasks the people

439
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,540
that like to take their time like to

440
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,940
make their notes like to go over their

441
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,860
forms and processes

442
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,199
those people are learning but are not

443
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,079
necessarily going to be as successful on

444
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,300
some kind of scoreboard

445
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,600
also pressure I've seen situations uh so

446
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,540
before cyber I was in medicine for a

447
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,459
little bit and I've seen people just

448
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,799
crumble under the pressure of a very

449
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,859
stressful life and death situation

450
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,380
have seen other people that just hop in

451
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,980
and know exactly what to do also some of

452
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,679
you probably do really well if you can

453
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,199
just kind of relax you like your

454
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,720
lavender candle you have your hacking

455
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,880
glow lights on in the background right

456
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,900
you set the mood now you're ready to go

457
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,080
you got your Tic Tac yeah I mean these

458
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,780
types of situations can be tailored

459
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,220
these learning experiences can be

460
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,260
tailored whether you love to compete

461
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,600
show your name on a scoreboard get the

462
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,240
high score get a perfect score get that

463
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,299
recognition or whether you're a solo

464
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,500
performer

465
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,539
everybody should be able to learn the

466
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,100
way that they want and imagine how how

467
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,960
discouraging it would be if you are new

468
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,080
to a field New to a topic and we're like

469
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
hey look all these people have already

470
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,980
gotten perfect scores and it only took

471
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,840
them like two hours and you get to

472
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,940
question one you're like I have no idea

473
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,640
what even what three words is

474
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,440
a little discouraging there would that

475
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,539
make you want to continue learning

476
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,480
maybe for some of you most of you maybe

477
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,860
not

478
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,160
also some people like working as a team

479
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,679
some people need to play as a team and

480
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,020
other people are more of those lone

481
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,360
performers either way is absolutely fine

482
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,220
and there are certain situations where

483
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,840
one might be more beneficial to the

484
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,700
other working as a team can be great

485
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,679
because you can parse out things hey you

486
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,419
cover this you cover this you cover this

487
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm going to focus on that and then

488
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,140
we'll all come together and we'll win

489
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,200
the challenge versus you being

490
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,960
responsible for everything I know a lot

491
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,179
of people that love being responsible

492
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,919
for everything because they know that

493
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,780
they can count on themselves they know

494
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,039
that they're not going to take that two

495
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
hour break after lunch because they're

496
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,820
tired and the team will suffer

497
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,880
so competition can be good

498
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,520
also there are a lot of resources out

499
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,260
there in cyber security there are a

500
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,660
bazillion capture the flags that are

501
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,120
free it people just giving it away there

502
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,160
are also some that maybe have some type

503
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,919
of donation associated with them or some

504
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,280
other a monetary type of investment in

505
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,620
the ocean World same thing we've got

506
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,140
free ones out there we've got paid ones

507
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,840
and and really you there's a there's a

508
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,480
great mix you can choose which one works

509
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,580
for you

510
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,559

511
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,440

right now in your daily lives some of

514
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,080
you may be interested in Ocean maybe

515
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
like Micah and they want to make the

516
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,919
jump into just doing that full-time uh

517
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,480
it's one of those things that just

518
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,000
catches certain people it's fun right

519
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,460
it's if you have the bug you have the

520
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,620
bug and if you're one of those people

521
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,080
like Micah and myself who really really

522
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,880
love open source intelligence or you

523
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,080
want to learn and you're fascinated

524
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,480
we've got some resources for you I have

525
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,580
a start me page that I'm a bit of an

526
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,160
information hoarder okay I love

527
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,799
knowledge I love to read people's blogs

528
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,720
I love reading articles I like watching

529
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,940
videos I like being in communities where

530
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,160
I can learn from other people that's fun

531
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
for me

532
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,280
but it gets a little bit overwhelming

533
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,860
okay so a long time ago I created a

534
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,260
start me page and I used it to organize

535
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,720
my own thoughts I have a section on my

536
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,880
favorite blogs I have a section on my

537
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,740
favorite open source intelligence tool

538
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,440
sets there's like 50 different places in

539
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,840
there just in the tool set section and

540
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,580
each one of them might have two thousand

541
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,840
three thousand different tools

542
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,580
categorized based on what you're trying

543
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,460
to do in ocent okay I don't have to

544
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,200
think about where my resources are now I

545
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
can go to one place and for those of you

546
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,559
that are not familiar with what a start

547
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,260
me is it's just a bookmark page of URLs

548
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,140
these icons up here represent a website

549
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,660
so each of those websites may have

550
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,700
different types of challenge content on

551
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,919
it in the ocean World lots of people

552
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,260
love sharing their URLs their bookmarks

553
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,740
via these start me Pages yeah

554
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,559
great so let's talk through some of the

555
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,320
discriminating factors for how you can

556
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,980
actually choose the best CTF for you or

557
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,720
the best learning challenge Hands-On

558
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,240
learning challenge in ocent we're going

559
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,280
to focus specifically the first one is

560
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,380
one one shots I don't know if any of you

561
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,120
look at Twitter and you see somebody

562
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,460
posting a picture hey I'm on vacation

563
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,620
and here's a picture out my window I bet

564
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,020
nobody can figure out where I am okay

565
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,240
those are one shots you figure it out

566
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,419
you're done and sometimes those one

567
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,640
shots help you learn something or

568
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,400
practice is skill they're very low

569
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
stress you work on it by yourself or you

570
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,260
can work on it as a team but you do it

571
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,600
in your own time if there's no like

572
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,299
limit on when you need to submit your

573
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,059
response also there's no cost involved

574
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,940
so very low barrier to entry

575
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,220
the bad part is you got to wait for the

576
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,220
next one to uh in the next post or the

577
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,260
next time somebody put or uh sends one

578
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,000
of these out there are some people out

579
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,700
there that work and put these type of

580
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,440
Open Source intelligence quizzes out

581
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,500
every single day and it's at hashtag or

582
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,620
not hashtag at quiztime on Twitter there

583
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,299
are different people and the cool thing

584
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,299
is is that they give you different uh

585
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,039
targets different subjects sometimes

586
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,140
they'll say hey I'm on a train right now

587
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,880
and they show you a picture they don't

588
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,559
tell you anything about it there's no

589
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,780
words and they're like what train is am

590
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,299
I on and what is three stops from here

591
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,799
what is the name of that town and you're

592
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,240
like I don't even know what part of the

593
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
world you're in but you work on it or

594
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
you read the Twitter replies and you see

595
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
how other people are solving this and

596
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,658
you get smarter

597
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,740
okay

598
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,440
so this next format is the learning CTF

599
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,600
and this is the one that's specifically

600
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,640
designed to allow you to progress your

601
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,140
learning along the way maybe not

602
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,380
necessarily just test your skills okay

603
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,700
in this case we're highlighting the

604
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,340
ocean dojo and osun Dojo is an amazing

605
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,580
uh resource uh kind of an ecosystem now

606
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,679
created by a friend of ours named

607
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,620
cindwindy online and the ocent dojo

608
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,860
allows you to not only go and learn and

609
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,860
challenge your skills it also allows you

610
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,380
to participate in the community so they

611
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,240
have a rank system within the ocean Dojo

612
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,980
where you can achieve higher ranks by

613
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,539
completing different things and that can

614
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,640
be giving a talk writing a blog post

615
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,159
getting involved in a community so it

616
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,600
really helps to build that sense of

617
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,760
community and at the same time they also

618
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,220
release challenges they also release

619
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,840
videos and things like that designed to

620
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,919
help you learn

621
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,780
and this specific one that's on the

622
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,419
slide is from the try hack me site which

623
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,520
some of you probably have been to free

624
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,100
site you go there sin Wendy has created

625
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,020
these challenges you go answer the

626
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,880
questions have some fun learn some

627
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,740
things the best part about it is like

628
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,140
Griffin said this is about learning so

629
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,880
there are hints in there and other

630
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,580
things to help you learn and grow

631
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,100
anybody ever play geoguessr here yeah

632
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,780
this is one of my favorite favorite

633
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,640
things geoguess are for those of you

634
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,140
that don't know it we're going to see a

635
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,880
little example of it later on but

636
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,220
essentially this is a website that's

637
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,919
made a game out of Google Street View

638
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
imagery you ever go to Google Street

639
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,580
View and you're like hey let me see

640
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,340
what's in this area well with geoguessr

641
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,679
the idea is is that they put you down in

642
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,780
a certain town city part of the world

643
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,299
and you have to figure out based upon

644
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,760
what you see around you where you are

645
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,860
sometimes you have to get it right to

646
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,900
the country level sometimes to the city

647
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,960
level sometimes to the meter and it's

648
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,760
actually kind of fun the the best part

649
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,580
about it is the variety of games you

650
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,799
like competing they've got Battle Royale

651
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,419
where you're going to go up against the

652
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,679
people on the other side of the world

653
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,380
that have nothing else to do but play

654
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,559
Geo guesser 24 7 and beat your butt and

655
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,700
it's fun

656
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,919
sometimes if you're somebody like me

657
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,960
that doesn't like to compete because you

658
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
don't like some 12 year old on the other

659
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,140
side of the world beating your butt then

660
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,840
they have a co-op mode that you can play

661
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,299
with your kids my kids are a little bit

662
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,159
older than Griffin's and are in college

663
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
and so you know on Friday nights or

664
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,880
Saturday nights when things are going

665
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,500
slow they want some time off they'll say

666
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,600
hey Dad you want to play geoguessr and

667
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,820
we could play together and figure out

668
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,279
where in the world we are in fact we we

669
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,080
shifted from watching The Great British

670
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,179
Bake Off once it it finished its season

671
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,279
last year from doing that on Friday

672
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,279
nights we started playing geoguessr and

673
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,500
you'd be amazed at the other skills that

674
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,020
your kids and you pick up and we'll talk

675
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,779
about those in a little bit

676
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,100
okay

677
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,799
now we have ctfs with missions okay has

678
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,539
anybody in here ever participated in a

679
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,640
tracelab CTF

680
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,860
just a couple of people okay so what

681
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,840
Trace Labs has done is they created an

682
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,659
entire organization around kind of

683
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,600
gamifying the research of missing

684
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,700
persons cases around the world

685
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,279
so what they do is periodically maybe

686
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,720
once a month or every couple of months

687
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,640
depending on how things are going they

688
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,799
will hold an event and it's got a static

689
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,200
amount of time it'll be you know five

690
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,960
six hours on a Sunday afternoon and you

691
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,539
can participate alone or in teams and

692
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,580
what you do is you sign up and they give

693
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,400
you at the beginning of the CTF event

694
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,559
the targets there might be four five six

695
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,720
different actual real missing persons

696
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,059
cases from anywhere in the world

697
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,400
and you get to start with whatever's

698
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,679
available on that missing person's case

699
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,960
and you go out with yourself or with

700
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,179
your team and you gather up as much open

701
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,039
source intelligence as you can that

702
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,720
might generate leads about that person's

703
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,940
whereabouts and you submit it and they

704
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,919
have a point system a scoring system and

705
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,299
you can achieve you can win a black

706
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,220
badge like we're all accustomed to in

707
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,039
other types of CTF challenges but more

708
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,020
importantly you're contributing to

709
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,659
something big okay I was a volunteer for

710
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,159
them a couple of years ago working on

711
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,140
the reporting team in the background and

712
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,940
after those events myself and a handful

713
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,980
of other people took those tips compiled

714
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,419
reports and sent them off to the law

715
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,159
enforcement agent that's in charge of

716
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,200
that missing person case and we help

717
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,559
generate those leads CTS with a mission

718
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,539
not only that but you see on the slide

719
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,640
there's the at myosin training short URL

720
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,039
that's just a short URL thing like bitly

721
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,320
or owly or whatever because we save you

722
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,080
time typing in the long URLs there

723
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,580
um here's another one and this is

724
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,860
actually really deep type of challenges

725
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,380
that that require you to invest a

726
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,960
significant amount of your time learning

727
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,539
exploring figuring stuff out

728
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,900
um this is one from sector 035 who's a

729
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,140
person over in Europe what he does is he

730
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,900
makes these simple uh these simple

731
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,419
challenges you just send an email off to

732
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,940
a certain email address and what will

733
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,260
happen is you'll get a reply back

734
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,299
that'll start you on your journey then

735
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,100
it'll tell you to do something when you

736
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,440
do something you have to then submit it

737
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,260
it will give you something else back and

738
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,480
so each time you solve a challenge it'll

739
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,820
give you your next mission it's actually

740
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,220
kind of cool and I know people that

741
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,679
spend literally the entire year working

742
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,539
through these really really hard

743
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,779
challenges it's free you can do it

744
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,360
however long you want and you you

745
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,799
there's actually a lot of learning and

746
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,120
growth that happens as well

747
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,320
okay and just for you because you're our

748
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,059
favorite audience this week as Michael

749
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,100
likes to say we have a short favorite

750
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,080
second favorite all right sorry if you

751
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,820
took our training class earlier this

752
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,100
week you guys are our favorite people

753
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,480
these are the second favorite second

754
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,679
favorite you guys are a very close

755
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
second we created a very short example

756
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,360
CTF with a handful of challenges in it

757
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,179
short URL uh or a QR code up there

758
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,159
that'll be up for probably a long time

759
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,919
but no pressure right the stress factor

760
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,059
is really low you're not competing

761
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,620
against anybody you can work it alone

762
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,140
it's free it's just an example and an

763
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,580
opportunity for you to come and try out

764
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,320
a couple of challenges of your own yeah

765
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,640
if you've never done an open source

766
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,820
intelligent CTF or any CTF sometimes

767
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,919
that first step that first barrier of oh

768
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,720
my gosh other people are going to see

769
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
what I'm posting oh my gosh I don't know

770
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,340
what I'm doing we wanted to remove all

771
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,159
that so all this is is a Google form and

772
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,080
there's things that you submit to it

773
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
things that cyber security people would

774
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,520
probably have a a pretty good handle on

775
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,740
and if not well we've got some hints

776
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,779
just submit your your answers and you'll

777
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,360
learn exactly what uh what to do

778
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,620
okay

779
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,980
the idea is that ocean learning and

780
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,559
Hands-On learning in general is a is an

781
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,000
opportunity for you to Choose Your Own

782
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,880
Adventure right you set the pace you

783
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,059
choose what you do and some of the the

784
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,460
offerings are absolutely incredible and

785
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,620
when you match how you learn with what

786
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,260
is out there you can do some amazing

787
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,460
things

788
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,520
you also get out of it what you put in

789
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,140
this sounds kind of simple but the

790
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,840
reality is a lot of people they will not

791
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,320
they will they will not try very hard we

792
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,880
have people that have done some of our

793
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,340
ctfs that get in there and all they're

794
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,840
doing is they're brute forcing the

795
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,120
answers we say something like the middle

796
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,279
name of this person is six letters and

797
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,520
they're like AAA

798
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,919
b b b b b b c and they're just brute

799
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,020
forcing it they're not even trying to go

800
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,320
answer the challenge so if that's what

801
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,480
you're doing fine but you're not

802
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
actually learning from the engagement

803
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,179
also try multiple platforms because what

804
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,860
you'll find is that the way that Griffin

805
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,500
and I create ctfs might be perfect for

806
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
the way that you work but you also might

807
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,260
find that sin windy or sector 035 or the

808
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,179
people at hacktoria actually have

809
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,360
something that's more engaging or fits

810
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,799
you the way that you like to do things

811
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,380
with your team and you can you can go

812
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,080
ahead and do a CTF with your team

813
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,059
if you are concerned about being

814
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,720
embarrassed about your low score or how

815
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,039
slowly you're doing things on the

816
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,260
scoreboard most of these ctfs allow you

817
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,960
to create a pseudonym a name

818
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,000
and if they require you to register with

819
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,899
an email go and create a CTF email for

820
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,880
you to use in these things that doesn't

821
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,240
have your name in it so I might create

822
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,520
you know John Doe one one three eight

823
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,820
five at hotmail.com and that's what I'm

824
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,559
using to register these so nothing's

825
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,240
going to come back to Michael Hoffman so

826
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,279
if I screw up in one of these ctfs so

827
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,380
what it doesn't matter

828
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,059
well Griffin and I have found also is

829
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,460
that the more you do this with friends

830
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,020
the more you sit at the table like all

831
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,520
right we're all going to do this CTF

832
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,559
what did you get oh the more you work on

833
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,600
that the bet the faster you actually

834
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,279
learn yeah you'll get through the CTF

835
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,960
better but you're tapping into the

836
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,779
people around you skills experiences and

837
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,299
knowledge and you'll actually do uh do

838
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,720
some faster learning

839
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,419
the first step is always the hardest one

840
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,640
and so all we ask you to do is give it a

841
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,980
try that example CTF nobody sees the

842
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,539
results except for Griffin and I so if

843
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,520
you've never done a capture the flag

844
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,980
give it a try that you have absolutely

845
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,440
nothing to lose

846
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,480
the other thing that you should think

847
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,500
about is

848
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
if you are working in some job cyber oh

849
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,260
since whatever and you have to learn

850
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,720
things on the job if you mess up then

851
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,399
guess what the database might get

852
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,460
corrupted or some hacker might get past

853
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,919
your Yara rules or whatever I think I

854
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,539
use that properly

855
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,000
um or you know other things might happen

856
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,299
that are bad in these ctfs the idea is

857
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,919
is that you're training in a safe

858
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,740
environment you mess up nothing happens

859
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,480
you maybe get a little bit deduction on

860
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,940
your points and that can be really

861
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,399
really helpful to just allow you to

862
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,740
continue to learn and you decide you

863
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,260
want to learn or compete this is from uh

864
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,020
geoguessr I've played literally hundreds

865
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,760
if not thousands probably hundreds of

866
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,620
hours of Geo guesser

867
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,720
um something I am proud of and I can

868
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,399
tell you this there's sometimes I want

869
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,980
to get the perfect 25

870
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,279
000 point value for five rounds of

871
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,980
geoguessr and so I will work literally

872
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,279
for hours trying to find out what this

873
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,980
shape of somebody's mailbox in Sweden

874
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,380
looks like and what street it can be

875
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,299
found on because I want to be that

876
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,220
precise other times I'm like yeah it's

877
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,140
close enough to this oh look I got over

878
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,960
20 000 points you're not always going to

879
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,059
want to compete sometimes you just want

880
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,640
to play and that's okay

881
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,240
I gave a talk back in 2017 2018 on

882
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,700
imposter syndrome a big mental health

883
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,200
issue for a lot of people in cyber

884
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,480
security and in other places as well and

885
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,000
I talked about one of the ways to defeat

886
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,340
or to Tamp down some of those feelings

887
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,679
that I have about imposter syndrome

888
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,159
are to track my progress learn a little

889
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,260
bit each day see how fast you can do

890
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,059
things see how much better you are than

891
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,620
before and so when you're doing

892
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,620
geogaster track your scores track how

893
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,600
fast it took you to find things oh I'm

894
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,179
really good over in Israel because they

895
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,460
have Hebrew on all their signs

896
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,440
um I'm really good over there but I need

897
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,899
to work over here and I can note my own

898
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,418
progress so now we're not just learning

899
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,239
we're working on our mental health and

900
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,300
really helping ourselves get better

901
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,280
okay so there's a bunch of other

902
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,020
intangible benefits that comes with

903
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,520
solving these challenges and Micah has

904
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,560
talked about some of these things but

905
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
they can bleed over into other parts of

906
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,399
your life your approach to this type of

907
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,260
learning or maybe your approach to

908
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,879
developing this type of learning for

909
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,918
your own team can help people build

910
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,619
other skills the organizational skills

911
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,060
how they keep track of the information

912
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,460
how they document it their attention to

913
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,800
detail all of that stuff matters when

914
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,719
you're solving a challenge and like

915
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,159
we've talked about already it might

916
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,780
matter because you compete against

917
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,820
yourself it might matter because you're

918
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,320
in front of a team and everybody can see

919
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,820
what you're doing it might matter

920
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,980
because you are results driven and you

921
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,839
have to have the top score all of that's

922
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,880
fine but the idea is that it's

923
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,160
motivating those skills to come out okay

924
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,500
it keeps you on task it helps you learn

925
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,839
and it helps you get better

926
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,700
so let's talk about this let me walk

927
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,260
through a little example of how this

928
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,540
might work and this here we're going to

929
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,740
be working on persistence and

930
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,720
determination because I know when you

931
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,460
are doing your cyber threat intelligence

932
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,260
and you're trying to find out who's

933
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,540
behind this IP address that's sending

934
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,940
the whatever towards our systems or when

935
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,099
you're looking at hey who's actually

936
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,680
going to be hired for our company I want

937
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,300
to learn about them and their skills and

938
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
where they're coming from you are

939
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,160
actually going through more than just a

940
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,079
cursory look at the data that's out

941
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,920
there

942
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,380
this is from geoguessr

943
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,079
um that that Google uh street view based

944
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,500
game and sometimes in geoguessr you get

945
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,440
put into a city and you can just you can

946
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,540
literally scroll around and you can see

947
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,300
like phone numbers and license plates

948
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,660
and signs that say Micah's hot dog joint

949
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,640
you go to Google and you type in Micah's

950
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,140
hot dog joint and there's only one in

951
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,060
the entire world and you know exactly

952
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,800
where you are

953
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,780
and other times you're on a dirt road

954
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,660
out in the middle of who knows where but

955
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,460
the cool thing about geoguessr is that

956
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,400
you can turn around and see that the

957
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,740
road continues the other direction and

958
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,140
there's nothing to go on but you know

959
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,660
what by playing this game by realizing

960
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,359
that I want to learn I start work going

961
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,180
down the road and for this exercise I

962
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,040
will just let you know I actually got

963
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,440
like tendonitis in my elbow because it

964
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,079
was it was kilometers of just clicking

965
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,599
and clicking and clicking this is what I

966
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,940
do for you all you see this hurting

967
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,020
myself

968
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,640
um and so sometimes you see Signs Now

969
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,380
signs and Geo guess are awesome because

970
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,540
there's language there's shape there's

971
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,480
color there's even things like how it's

972
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,520
How the sign is strapped to the pole

973
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,859
there are websites out there like Geo

974
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,859
hints and Geo tips where you can

975
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,839
actually look up hey for a sign with

976
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,760
these two straps on the back that's

977
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,920
probably over in Hungary versus Chile

978
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,140
it's amazing so you look at the sign

979
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,880
you're like

980
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,700
um okay I I can't make that out

981
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,560
so you get a little bit sad right but

982
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,359
you keep working and you keep going down

983
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,760
that road and another 15 minutes go by

984
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,980
and I finally find this and I'm like yes

985
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,780
people and I've got Hogs and horses now

986
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,440
I know nothing about Hogs horses foliage

987
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,560
nothing like that so if I did know that

988
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,720
that was a certain type of hog that is

989
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,220
only raised in a certain part of the

990
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,220
world I would be golden but this is just

991
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,520
extra data and I don't know that what I

992
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,859
can do is look at the people I can look

993
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,660
at the color of their skin I can look at

994
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,579
their clothing I can look at other

995
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,260
things like hey there are they smoking

996
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,839
cigarettes are they holding things what

997
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,700
color are their clothing and then I note

998
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,040
those in my I put that in my notes

999
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,540
just like if you're doing a pen test

1000
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,940
you're recording all the services that a

1001
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,160
system has open and then you'll come

1002
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,420
back to it

1003
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,740
you never know what you're going to need

1004
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,140
so I note these things down and I go

1005
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,820
down the road and you know what after

1006
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,220
about a half hour of going down this

1007
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,220
road just clicking you start seeing the

1008
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,040
Matrix like you see there's water

1009
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,900
there's like mud on the road there in

1010
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,839
the center tire tracks is this in the

1011
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,780
desert part of the world nope we also

1012
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,820
see certain vegetation up there Lush

1013
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,560
vegetation I mean there's probably a lot

1014
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,599
of water okay you know that that's

1015
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,280
something

1016
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,260
um we can we can kind of make those

1017
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,599
assumptions in our heads and then and

1018
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,960
then you see a sign with words and you

1019
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,240
hear the angels singing and and you're

1020
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,720
like yes finally it's it says uh

1021
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,160
territorio

1022
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,260
um all right well I'm not exactly sure

1023
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,420
what that means

1024
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,119
but I go to Google Translate and I

1025
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,160
translate I'm like okay I'm getting some

1026
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,440
things now maybe we're in a certain

1027
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,599
place also there's standing water on

1028
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,280
that road means they'll probably get

1029
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,500
more water than they can than they can

1030
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,200
use all right so maybe rainforest if I

1031
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,060
translate this with Google lens on my

1032
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,339
mobile or on a device it says territory

1033
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:11,760
with community property Canada law

1034
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,460
all right but we also see the language

1035
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,079
the language where the number three is

1036
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,760
this quechua

1037
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,400
I don't know what that is maybe some of

1038
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,560
you do but I Google it and what happens

1039
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,960
is it comes up and says South African

1040
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,240
people of Peru parts of Bolivia Chile

1041
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,180
Colombia and Ecuador now I've localized

1042
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,579
it there are six continents I don't care

1043
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,700
about right now just focusing on one and

1044
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,320
we put that in our bag and then we keep

1045
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,880
going down the road and we see these

1046
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,700
people wearing very traditional very

1047
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,820
common clothing of people in that area

1048
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,560
of the world so now I have confirmation

1049
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,079
and I'm still persistent so 15 minutes

1050
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,400
later I'm going down the road even

1051
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
further and I see another sign and I'm

1052
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,280
like yes

1053
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,099
I can kind of make out that word and

1054
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,020
this is the problem with Google is that

1055
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,599
how many times you're like oh I'll just

1056
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,980
take that phone number off the building

1057
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,220
and it blurs it out redacts it here it's

1058
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,440
just low resolution but I I think that

1059
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,540
says tardigal and when you search on

1060
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,640
tardigal you find out that it's in

1061
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,680
Argentina and then when you look in

1062
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,440
Argentina and where tardigal is is it

1063
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,400
near Bolivia is it near Chile yes which

1064
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,200
really matches with that ketchup

1065
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,579
language right

1066
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,760
all right so now we start looking at

1067
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,200
roads that are going the same direction

1068
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,960
that we were going on that on geoguessr

1069
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,599
and when we find a road going Northeast

1070
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,359
and southwest that is in tardigal or

1071
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,820
near tardigal we can pick a place on

1072
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,920
that road and when I put that that

1073
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,960
number two down there pardon me is like

1074
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,060
oh you put it down in the wrong place

1075
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,640
you're 12 kilometers off but in the

1076
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,480
entire world I was 12 kilometers away

1077
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,359
from this random picture in some part of

1078
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,280
the world I've never been to

1079
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,560
I chalk that up as a win even though I

1080
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,540
only got

1081
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,220
4852 points because sometimes it comes

1082
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,599
it's the experience experience you get

1083
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,700
when

1084
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,579
that 12 kilometer result

1085
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,859
I know if I persist in my work I know if

1086
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,480
I persist in my learning

1087
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,060
I'll get to that end result eventually

1088
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,540
then I can put the ice packs on my arms

1089
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,740
okay

1090
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,540
so of course it's not all about winning

1091
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,940
right but some people the motivated by

1092
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,099
winning people don't have fun unless

1093
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,720
they win or have a chance to win and

1094
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,640
that's okay I throw this in here as a

1095
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,680
little bit of a jab because obviously we

1096
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,599
are the type of people that try to err

1097
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,040
on the side of letting people have the

1098
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,359
learning experience without the pressure

1099
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,400
of competition but that's not for

1100
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,520
everyone

1101
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,660
and that's our talk ladies and gentlemen

1102
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,520
you might have noticed two out of the

1103
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,400
three slashes uh have appeared in the in

1104
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,619
this talk uh there's another one maybe

1105
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,680
oh wait do we all three of them were

1106
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,960

1107

00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,859
location is yes dang you

1114
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
um this is our information up here uh

1115
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,359
this is the a link to the CTF does

1116
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,339
anybody have any questions for Griffin

1117
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:23,700
or I yes yes

1118
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,180
congratulations

1119
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,700
okay

1120
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,560
okay so the question is we got in the

1121
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,020
ocean world what do you get what do you

1122
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,359
do if you are looking up a person and

1123
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:37,560
they don't have a lot of information

1124
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,820
online

1125
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,280
they're almost a ghost so in the ocean

1126
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,800
world what we do is we look for that

1127
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,200
person any identifiers can't find it

1128
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,180
what we do is we know that sometimes the

1129
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,400
weakest links are the people around them

1130
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,680
so I'm going to Branch out to if it's in

1131
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,780
scope for my investigation and that's

1132
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,280
the thing is that Griffin and I do

1133
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,140
investigations we're not randomly

1134
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,880
stalking people we're not looking up

1135
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,800
people just to look into their lives

1136
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,560
we're doing it with a purpose so if my

1137
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,240
purpose is finding this person because

1138
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,740
they're in Jeopardy or they've gone

1139
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,300
missing I'm going to look at their

1140
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,319
friends I'm going to look at their

1141
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,960
family members because invariably

1142
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,520
there's going to be some family member

1143
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,040
taking a picture with my target even

1144
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,359
though my target doesn't have a Facebook

1145
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:21,060
account so I'll switch to them

1146
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,560
other questions about open source

1147
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,460
intelligence or training or ctfs sir

1148
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,680
how do you avoid what

1149
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,480
how do you avoid getting yourself in

1150
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,680
trouble

1151
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,220
I'm thinking that you probably mean can

1152
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,598
you tell me more about what you mean

1153
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,319
okay

1154
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,260
so uh the question is is how do you keep

1155
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,720
yourself safe when you might need to

1156
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,720
visit sites that has content that's not

1157
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,579
maybe legal or ethical for you to

1158
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,380
download would that be right Griffin go

1159
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,119
ahead and take this one sure so

1160
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,440
thanks

1161
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,720
how long can I stop

1162
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,839
um so I work in the world of uh crimes

1163
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,359
against children including child sexual

1164
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,579
exploitation material and things of that

1165
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,640
nature uh there are certain subsets of

1166
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,619
people with the legal authority to be

1167
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,680
able to handle and process that imagery

1168
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,619
there's also I mean we could spend the

1169
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:26,760
rest of the day talking about everything

1170
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,619
that runs alongside that from mental

1171
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:30,660
health to systems protection and

1172
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,720
everything else what I will say is when

1173
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,400
it comes to open source intelligence

1174
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,160
strictly know your legal boundaries know

1175
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,079
your company policy boundaries because

1176
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,119
those will oftentimes be more stringent

1177
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,700
than your legal boundaries

1178
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,040
and also know the ethics of what you're

1179
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,220
going to do ethics is something that is

1180
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,380
uh there is no black and white ethical

1181
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,900
line there's a lot of things that are

1182
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,119
hotly debated you know is it is it open

1183
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,560
source intelligence if I go password

1184
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,359
knock your account on Facebook so I can

1185
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,040
get a partially redacted version of your

1186
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,960
email address so that I can corroborate

1187
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,640
it with something else and then I know

1188
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,960
that your phone number is the same as

1189
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,700
those last two digits that I saw you

1190
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,640
know so there's there's gray areas in

1191
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,619
that regard when it comes to legality

1192
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,780
and it comes to the material literature

1193
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,640
I think that you're asking about there's

1194
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,680
no gray area okay if you're not

1195
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,119
authorized and you're not in law

1196
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,380
enforcement you don't go to those places

1197
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,339
you don't do those things

1198
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,160
yes

1199
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,200
yes yeah I mean there are saved so one

1200
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,819
of the other things that Griffin and I

1201
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,920
do much like many of you that maybe uh

1202
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,020
malware hunters or incident responders

1203
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,119
that have to investigate some site that

1204
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,520
is some callback or or hosting malware

1205
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,740
that your users might be going to there

1206
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,319
are ways of visiting websites pulling

1207
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,380
down data without pulling sensitive

1208
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,380
content like malicious documents or even

1209
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,359
images I don't know if any of you are

1210
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,760
from the past like I am but I used to

1211
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,339
browse the internet using links which is

1212
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,680
a terminal based yeah we laugh about it

1213
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,660
but think about it if you have sensitive

1214
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,839
content like kids being exploited and

1215
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,819
that's absolutely legal for you to even

1216
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:11,220
see or put on your computer in your web

1217
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,780
browser's cache

1218
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,000
don't even bring it down use a

1219
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,160
text-based web browser to get the text

1220
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,099
but not the images if there's other

1221
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,599
things that are illegal

1222
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,760
um that you that we didn't cover just

1223
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,740
talk to Griffin afterwards yes sir

1224
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,640
so oh I can do this let me do it yeah so

1225
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,960
so the question is about synthetic

1226
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,060
personas which some of you might know as

1227
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,680
sock puppets some of you might know them

1228
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,960
as research accounts or alternative

1229
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,960
identities and they're these these uh

1230
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,900
false Persona they're people on social

1231
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,940
media that aren't really real people

1232
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,099
people are using them to put distance

1233
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,099
between their real accounts and whatever

1234
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,619
it is they're looking for so if I want

1235
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,900
to gain access to some organization I

1236
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,720
might on Facebook get a very attractive

1237
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,540
young woman's picture and make a very

1238
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,240
attractive uh maybe a Young Person's

1239
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,579
LinkedIn saying hey I just graduated

1240
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,859
with a cyber security degree in this

1241
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,680
place I'm studying for my a plus and I'm

1242
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,720
really looking to get into cyber

1243
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,420
security and start connecting her to

1244
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,400
different places that's more catfishing

1245
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,280
that's the operationalizing of that of

1246
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,200
that sock puppet account but how do we

1247
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,060
figure this out well we verify and

1248
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,099
validate that's that's the first thing

1249
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:36,960
you look at that Pro profiling Griffin

1250
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,720
has done this two billion times taking

1251
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,540
scammer informations from Reddit and

1252
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,520
other things you you research those

1253
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,079
phone numbers to those emails those

1254
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,540
pictures is that picture reused

1255
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,339
somewhere else is it a model on some

1256
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,440
stock photo site yeah and if you're

1257
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,579
interested in learning how to do that

1258
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,880
myosin training has a class on

1259
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,099
it's a good one yeah so the the people

1260
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,180
that

1261
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,619
um the people that are very careful and

1262
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,300
have great operational security and hide

1263
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,099
all of their details and stuff that can

1264
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:06,960
be very time consuming and maybe require

1265
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,839
some level of Engagement to uncover uh

1266
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,520
the folks that are doing this at scale

1267
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,640
the shotgun approach you know uh scam

1268
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,500
website that goes up for 48 hours until

1269
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,000
it gets knocked down and stuff those

1270
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,619
people are recycling elements because

1271
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,300
they don't have the luxury of time right

1272
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,619
they're recycling imagery they're

1273
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,079
recycling text from other places you can

1274
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,180
find uh you know you could find that

1275
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,920
text being repeated on the next scam

1276
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,319
website as soon as they send it up or uh

1277
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:32,819
you know maybe you find it referenced in

1278
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,619
Prior research material and like there's

1279
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,119
things that you can do to exploit those

1280
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,980
unfortunately the really good one-on-one

1281
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,140
actors that only have their own time to

1282
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,540
to deal with that can like I said that

1283
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,339
can require engagement

1284
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,619
yeah you break apart that what's that

1285
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,359
fish

1286
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,800
ing fishing versus wind right if

1287
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,839
somebody takes the time to put in make a

1288
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,300
really good Persona you're not going to

1289
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,619
be able to discern the different I mean

1290
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,420
the personas that we use in our work

1291
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,640
you'll never be able to see them we're

1292
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,500
already connected to all of you hashtag

1293
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,760
besides Augusta yes sir

1294
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,500
the question is what's the best way to

1295
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,300
create your own sock puppet so we're

1296
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,099
going to defer that because we teach

1297
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,380
classes that take 45 minutes to just

1298
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,420
teach part of that so

1299
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,980
um there are training courses out there

1300
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,200
that can help you create those and the

1301
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,119
idea with sock puppets good people use

1302
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,859
them because I don't want to go on

1303
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,740
Facebook looking you up and you see hey

1304
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,800
look Michael Hoffman ocean person is

1305
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,260
looking me up that might spook you or

1306
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,300
otherwise so we create sock puppet
