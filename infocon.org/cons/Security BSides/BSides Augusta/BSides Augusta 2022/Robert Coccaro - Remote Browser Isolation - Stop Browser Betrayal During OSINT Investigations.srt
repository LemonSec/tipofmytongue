1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,160
jeopardize that uh investigation right

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,260
okay so what I'm going to cover is like

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,820
you know

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,699
um how online research can compromise

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,039
those investigations the cautions of

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,660
using these things that we get

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,420
comfortable using like incognito mode

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,760
private mode and all those things and

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
hey and a VPN and then we're going to

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,780
talk about the differences between

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,540
non-attribution misattribution and

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,000
managed attribution and any time during

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,160
this thing of mine please if you have a

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,680
question uh raise my raise your hand

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,620
we'll address it also my boss is in the

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,700
background to make sure I don't say

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,440
anything stupid so

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,379
um he he's there for the the QC part of

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,399
this

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,059
um

21
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,719
so let's talk about uh open source right

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,360
so if you've been around you know in the

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,640
last 10 years or so and and been paying

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,199
attention to like open source

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,180
intelligence and and investigations

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,820
right it used to just be like

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,979
um if you were like a maybe if you

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,380
worked in law enforcement or you were

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,820
just some guy that creeped on your

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,439
neighbor or something like that right

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,900
people would always get online and just

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,400
do some research right they didn't know

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,960
they were doing open source research

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,240
they just called it creeping Right But

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,200
as time has evolved and and more the

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,479
complexities that have have uh you know

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,299
grown along with us these are some of

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,759
the industries that now open source has

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,460
become a day-to-day part of right uh

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,259
brand reputation companies want to say

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,540
hey who's uh who's trying to tarnish our

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,700
brand who's trying to make us look not

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,380
as good as we are

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,960
um fraud investigations right trust and

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,540
safety teams what about companies that

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,259
um

47
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,540
um you know

48
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,040
knockoffs of iPhones and things like

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,740
that knock off of electronics you know

50
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,040
overseas Alibaba not to be calling

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,560
anyone out but you know are known for

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,340
selling fraud uh you know

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,239
knockoffs of other Hardware

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,860
um so

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,480
specifically we're going to talk about

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,140
you know the common online research

57
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,239
resources which are here right not all

58
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,160
of them obviously this is a very very

59
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,400
short list but these are not just the

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,459
only areas for osent work right you can

61
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,300
also newspapers

62
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,480
news your nosy neighbor who's always

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,879
gossiping right that's open source

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,160
research right but specifically we want

65
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,980
to talk about this and the aspect of

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,359
doing it online

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,879
I was making sure I did there were some

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,379
transitions in here earlier that were

69
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,420
really bugging me and my boss got those

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,920
out for me so

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,200
um so here's what we need to do and then

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,720
these are the challenges right A lot of

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,340
times maybe many of you are very

74
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,340
familiar familiar with this exact

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,459
um scenario where you're at work and you

76
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,500
need to get some information you really

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,060
need to go somewhere and get something

78
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,280
but you're blocked by your corporate

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,680
firewall or I can't get anywhere because

80
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,260
I'm not allowed to go so you want me to

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,000
do something but you don't give me the

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,900
access to go there and do it right as we

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,060
do investigations right protecting our

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,879
identity protecting our methods and

85
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,840
protecting our reputations is very

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
important but like I said the challenges

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,300
there on the other side you know risk of

88
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,420
retaliation if you're doing uh research

89
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,680
on a particular apt a particular you

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,860
know nefarious individual you don't want

91
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,040
to tip them that you might be

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,940
um

93
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,980
you know looking into to what they're

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,959
doing on their day-to-day so that was a

95
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,760
big Challenge and a concern that we have

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,340
okay

97
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,519
browsers we have to use them right they

98
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,159
are useful and they serve a great

99
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,099
purpose but they do betray us right

100
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,320
websites collect

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,139
all of this information about us every

102
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,820
time you go online think about the

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,639
amount of time that you spend online on

104
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,720
a day-to-day basis over weeks years and

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,180
months and you've always used the same

106
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,600
browser and how much are you telling all

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,639
of these organizations these companies

108
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,460
the the personal things about yourself

109
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,940
what TVs I like what I like to eat where

110
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,860
what am I doing for entertainment right

111
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,020
and if you take all of that information

112
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,639
and then compare it with the little

113
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,620
things we walk around with our pocket on

114
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,259
with our location data on with our

115
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,180
Bluetooth on connecting to see how much

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,919
my heart rate beats right

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,780
25 years ago if I walked up to you and

118
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,660
said hey uh I need you to let me know

119
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,860
how many times you go to the bathroom

120
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,440
Okay uh what'd you eat for dinner and

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
what are you gonna do tomorrow oh and

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,860
every time you make a friend let me know

123
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
I need to know that right

124
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,419
no one would do that but we voluntarily

125
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,180
do that these days and so while we do

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,919
that and then we take that same

127
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
information in the same place where we

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,539
conduct an investigation what are we

129
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,639
saying right we're really giving up a

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
lot of information about what we say

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,919
about ourselves online and now if we try

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,780
to do an investigation

133
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,080
using those same methods then we are

134
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,400
seriously convoluting the two

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,560
I don't know if anybody some of you may

136
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,259
not even been born in the 90s but back

137
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,240
in those days if you ever went online

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
with your AOL CD or you know dropped it

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,680
in and had the nice little uh you know

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,100
faxing type sound back then this is the

141
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,199
way Amazon looked right I mean it's just

142
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,479
like says texting some images some

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,120
animated gifs because it was designed

144
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,840
for Speed right we there was not too

145
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,639
much just text in there so and and our

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,340
bandwidth back then is not near what it

147
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,039
is today right it's man you've got gig

148
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,000
speed sometimes even more so because of

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,780
those enhancements right we have come a

150
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,539
long way now look what we do on site

151
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,660
right feature Rich you know

152
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,860
um real time scrolling codex JavaScript

153
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,860
um you know just videos within the page

154
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,620
right it's just so Dynamic right there's

155
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,479
so much you can do on a website these

156
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,419
days because of the amount of bandwidth

157
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,639
and the technology there's a lot more

158
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,600
that we can do right

159
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,240
but because of all those enhanced

160
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,280
features and all of those things that we

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,860
can now do with these websites we pay a

162
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,600
price right

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,300
the price is we give up a lot of this

164
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,819
information about what we're doing now I

165
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,620
know everybody in this room knows what a

166
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,940
cookie is Right putting little

167
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,979
information on your browser at the

168
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,919
request of a web server so that it can

169
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,720
uh you know uh

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,539
possibly track you from from location to

171
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,460
location

172
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,560
across the internet not all cookies are

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,360
bad right we're really concerned about

174
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,360
third-party cookies third party referral

175
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,819
cookies because we didn't have them you

176
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,680
might not be able to remember in two

177
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,620
weeks of what I put in my Amazon cart

178
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,319
today so it's not necessarily cookies

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
are bad it's just the type of cookies

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
that we're concerned about and because

181
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,180
of this increased technology and

182
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,039
bandwidth and all the things we can do

183
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,039
there's other places where we can store

184
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,319
information as you go about your

185
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,780
day-to-day right the web Dom right

186
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,360
basically it's just a bigger place to

187
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,400
store more information right that's all

188
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,680
it is at the request of the website

189
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,160
right so cookies

190
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,400
webs Dom storage right all of these

191
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,099
things are going to help in building a

192
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,699
fingerprint about us right so through

193
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,280
targeted advertising techniques browsing

194
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,740
websites sensitive to investigations can

195
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,960
lead fingerprints that it's expose the

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,060
investigator right and then in addition

197
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,419
to those things of cookies and and the

198
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,879
cash and the web storage and all of

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
those things these are some other areas

200
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
of concern

201
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,539
right canvas fingerprinting right

202
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,320
there's one sole purpose for canvas

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,779
fingerprinting and that is just to track

204
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,620
your activity across the internet and if

205
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,600
you read what this is right basically

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
this one sums it up right here instructs

207
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,459
a web browser to draw specific text or

208
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,860
shape on a screen examine it and then it

209
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,940
looks for uniqueness as you go about

210
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,040
your day to day so basically it just

211
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,019
draws this little thing that you can't

212
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,060
see a little speck somewhere and they're

213
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,339
able to compare that with like a hash

214
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,080
value and they see that hash value

215
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,779
somewhere else that's obviously you I'm

216
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,640
going to keep going where you go and

217
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,200
just staying on your tail to see what

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,279
you're doing

219
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,459
okay also these are the other things

220
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,800
that are you know uh

221
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,620
tracked as we do our day-to-day

222
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,300
investigations and even your just

223
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,940
day-to-day work and browsing right

224
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,860
websites have to know what exact type

225
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,380
audio you have so they can render that

226
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,019
content to you so you can make use of it

227
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,399
so they have to know that you're looking

228
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,459
listening through airpods or beats or

229
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,380
whatever it is and then they create the

230
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,899
audio fingerprint for you so we're just

231
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,540
building building building building

232
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,459
uh to create a unique profile and

233
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,760
fingerprint about users right

234
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,339
plugins we'll talk about some plugins

235
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,279
here but hey plugins are great right and

236
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,720
there's a you know some for

237
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,640
screenshotting some for you know

238
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
changing my user agent and we'll get

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,720
into that in a little bit as well but

240
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,120
the more plugins that you add to a

241
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,820
browser the more unique you become right

242
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,440
because now you're adding something

243
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,620
different to your browser that somebody

244
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,160
else may not so you create uniqueness so

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,620
you know we always say in in cyber

246
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,779
security you've got Security on this

247
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,580
side and you got convenience on this

248
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,740
side and you have this slider in the

249
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,600
middle and you just find your comfort

250
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,459
level of where you want to be between

251
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,860
comfort and security right and so that's

252
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,060
kind of what we're going to do we're

253
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,680
going to try to get to a comfort level

254
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,019
manage our risk but we think everything

255
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,140
is going to work for us

256
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,300
attribution

257
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,360
concerns mitigated through uh different

258
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,160
types of browser attribution that's what

259
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,200
we're going to talk about non-miss and

260
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,620
managed right whoa that's two I'm trying

261
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,240
to fly through this so I can get on the

262
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,300
the keys and show a couple of things and

263
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,860
hopefully the demo gods are going to

264
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,440
work with me today right non-attribution

265
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,940
right provides a degree of anonymity

266
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,579
very difficult to accomplish right vpns

267
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,320
kind of give us a little this and we'll

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
show but you know if you have poor

269
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
tradecraft while you're connected to a

270
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,560
VPN you can totally blow your cover I

271
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,640
thought this was a little funny thing

272
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,200
remember on the internet when nobody

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,240
knew who you were right

274
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,920
um that's really not the case anymore

275
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,339
now is it

276
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,079
misattribution is providing false

277
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,240
information

278
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
manipulating certain things about the

279
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,860
browser or about our habits so that

280
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,680
people really don't know who we are I'm

281
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,140
providing false information some might

282
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,880
even call it lying but it depends on the

283
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,279
scope of work right on what I'm trying

284
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,880
to do right so in the browser these are

285
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,740
some of the attributes that I kind of

286
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,800
want to be concerned about and look at

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,740
providing misinformation about these

288
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,360
things so that instead of my concern

289
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,120
about people tracking what I'm doing

290
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,100
across the internet

291
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,579
I am leading them to a place I want them

292
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,820
to go and giving them information I want

293
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
them to see that doesn't tie back to me

294
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,100
right so it's not so much about like I

295
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,240
don't want them to track me here I don't

296
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,459
want to do that no no no you're giving

297
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,640
them the information you want them to

298
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,339
have right and it doesn't come back to

299
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,100
you

300
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,779
managed attribution is exactly that

301
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,779
thing right where we control what we

302
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,019
want right we are setting the the

303
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,060
playing field we start from the

304
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,100
beginning and like okay I'm starting

305
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,540
with a fresh clean slate here and from

306
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,120
this point forward this is how I want

307
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,279
you to see me this is where I want you

308
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,620
to see me live this is how I want you to

309
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,260
see me work this is the language that I

310
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,440
speak right and now none of that might

311
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,899
be true but they don't know that

312
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,000
hopefully right nothing's impossible

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,820
right

314
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,620
so this is where I'll wait a little bit

315
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,240
now good I'll just do a whole demo at

316
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,560
the end but don't let me forget this

317
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
right so browser fingerprinting maybe

318
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
you guys who's heard you know a cover

319
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,660
Your Tracks anyone right awesome no one

320
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,459
nobody's saying oh awesome hey okay

321
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,600
sweet

322
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,820
um at least you learned one thing

323
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,240
um am I unique browser leaks right these

324
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
are some of these sites that you can go

325
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,260
to to um

326
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,959
see what you look like out on the

327
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,519
internet right and I'll do a couple I'll

328
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,620
do probably most of these here in a

329
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,700
second right

330
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,519
is that 10 minutes to go until I'm done

331
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,160
I thought I had an hour

332
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
it said I had a full hour that's what

333
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,979
they told me

334
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,720
all right reset

335
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,279
okay trying to kick me out of here

336
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,420
already I know I know everybody wants to

337
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,860
get home watch college football I got

338
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,800
you I know Roll Tide I got it uh anyway

339
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,260
actually he loves me back there anyway

340
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,440
so these things are some places that you

341
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,459
can go and uh see how you look out on

342
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,079
the internet what you're saying to the

343
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,180
world and so there's an example right

344
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,800
there but we'll do a real world example

345
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,120
here in just a second okay so

346
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,639
no this is where I go into the real demo

347
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,260
and then I'll come back here and want

348
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,300
you to remember these things okay so I'm

349
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,500
going to stand here

350
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,040
and I'm going to get out of this

351
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
um I need like a

352
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,880
I need a real guy there okay there we go

353
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
Okay so

354
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,000
this is an example of my I guess you

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,199
guys can see that right is that okay

356
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,380
I'll make that be good maybe no okay

357
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,459
anyway this is an example of my uh

358
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,699
virtual machine setup right so what I

359
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,440
have done let's go and make that a

360
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,500
little bigger well I'll just explain it

361
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,079
so you can see up here I have my virtual

362
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
machines right and then the number one

363
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,500
folder is my base images right so with

364
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,360
these base images whether it's Cali

365
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,579
Ubuntu whatever your Gen 2 whatever your

366
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:12,240
distribution Windows of choice I create

367
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,260
a base image this base image is where I

368
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,600
add my new tools where I do my pseudo

369
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,540
app updates and upgrades I keep it patch

370
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,420
I do everything to that base image that

371
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,519
I want to take with me on an

372
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,160
investigation right

373
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,120
from that base image I clone it I

374
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
snapshot it I back it up I do all of

375
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,260
these things and now I'm talking about

376
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,000
doing this kind of locally right maybe

377
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,579
on your local machine maybe your local

378
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,139
network or something but then we're

379
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,660
going to bring this up into maybe a

380
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,459
cloud environment and the two things

381
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,620
that we really want to be concerned with

382
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,220
while we do this is isolation and

383
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,320
anonymity right that's what we want to

384
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,480
achieve as we start these investigations

385
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,940
right okay so I have a couple images

386
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,339
here all right I've updated them I've

387
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,800
made clones everything is good I haven't

388
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,220
done anything but update those and keep

389
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,320
them active with the tools that I use on

390
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,360
a day-to-day basis right

391
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,320
so now I say okay somebody says hey uh

392
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,860
we need to go find that guy who uh

393
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,079
let's grab that purse the other day so

394
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm like okay I will clone it and I will

395
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,579
say hey clone this image and then I drag

396
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,120
it into my active case now in my active

397
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,339
case that's where I'm gonna go okay I'm

398
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,899
going to create a sock puppet I got my

399
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,139
burner phone I got my uh profile that

400
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,959
I'm like this surfer dude uh you know

401
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,759
who just loves to be out on the waves

402
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,040
I've done all these things that I am

403
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,380
establishing the Persona that I want

404
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,060
people to think who I am in the place

405
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,820
where I want it done with the languages

406
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,920
that I speak it'll all make much more

407
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,279
sense here in just a second then once I

408
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,819
am done with that one I will just drag

409
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,859
it into my archive and then I created

410
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,140
one just to test my theory and that's

411
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,780
the one that I'm basically uh working

412
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,459
off of

413
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,260
so that

414
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,319
investigation is over it's been archived

415
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,220
right

416
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,980
the way things are done today that we

417
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,599
have seen in the industry with

418
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,660
especially with local law enforcement

419
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,740
even Even in our own government agencies

420
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,660
is they might do step one uh

421
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,160
but they'll just stay right there

422
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
they'll be like okay that case is over

423
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,020
and they'll say okay that's okay we

424
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,340
we're going to continue to do other

425
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,460
investigations but they never reset the

426
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,059
playing field so the uh

427
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,340
environment of which they did the

428
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,940
investigation will carry some

429
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,120
um residual

430
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,100
residuals into the next investigation

431
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,140
because now you've established a profile

432
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,600
and this profile likes to do this right

433
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,080
and now you go into this other thing

434
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,280
completely different

435
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,039
that these agencies and the sites that

436
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,799
you get are still aggregating all of

437
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
that stuff because you've never reset it

438
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,280
right and you don't want it to give you

439
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,059
skewed content as you go up there and uh

440
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,340
you know conduct the investigation so if

441
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
I'm going to start a new investigation I

442
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,840
will grab it again from the base image

443
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,100
right even if I use the same Persona at

444
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,760
least I am not bringing the residue of

445
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,980
the places I went and the things that I

446
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,100
did ideally if you can afford the budget

447
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,200
or have the means of the resources you

448
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,299
would start with new personas each time

449
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,700
if that's possible Right

450
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,799
Okay so

451
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,260
start clean

452
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,360
investigate archive rinse and repeat

453
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,860
right

454
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,760
um then oh hey there it is

455
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,700
they got a lot smaller when you hooked

456
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,559
me up into this thing here okay so here

457
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,660
I am I have a virtual machine here

458
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
remember my name

459
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,220
okay so I've opened up a web page here

460
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,440
right uh and I'm gonna do a couple of

461
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,220
things right I'm not going to do the uh

462
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,020
incognito mode or anything like that but

463
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,600
the next time you guys go to incognito

464
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,360
mode and private browsing read what it

465
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,100
says it says hey we'll delete your

466
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,840
history maybe get rid of some cookies

467
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,679
but your ISP can still track what you're

468
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,539
doing on the internet

469
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,520
um particularly like it'll say that

470
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,980
particular warning in Firefox Chrome has

471
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,080
something different but they all say the

472
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,179
same thing like hey this is not like

473
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:52,620
something that you should like you know

474
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,799
uh invest in that this is going to keep

475
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,820
you 100 Anonymous okay so I just use

476
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,980
start Pages my home page not a big deal

477
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,120
all right so an example of how sites

478
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,460
track US anybody heard of thunderbeam

479
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,919
Light Beam any of these this is a

480
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,799
browser extension free I encourage you

481
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,559
to download it use it and then in a week

482
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
come back and look at your activity and

483
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,100
see what happens we're going to do an

484
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,740
example right here so here I am

485
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,160
fresh new browser Clean Cash clean

486
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,700
cookies nothing just brand new VM and

487
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm like installed some extensions read

488
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,740
the extensions the descriptions where

489
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,780
they come from vet them a little bit see

490
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,100
if you're comfortable with adding those

491
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,340
in so this one here is called light beam

492
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,460
right so what light beam will do you see

493
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,960
there's nothing there right now right

494
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,240
what light beam will do

495
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
is show you all of the cookies that are

496
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,380
associated as you go along the internet

497
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,679
right and not only will they show you

498
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,480
the cookies but they'll show you the

499
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,000
cookie relations so let's take a look at

500
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,039
that right here all right so here's

501
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,080
Light Beam I'm going to open this up

502
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,059
remember Light Beam has nothing there

503
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,580
right I'm just going to go right here

504
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,940
um let's do uh let's go to hey we'll go

505
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,620
to Amazon we already talked about that

506
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,140
right so go to Amazon I'm hot spotting

507
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,820
off my phone because I just really don't

508
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,460
trust public Wi-Fi anywhere especially

509
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,640
at a hacker conference right okay so

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
here I am a couple of vpns on top of

511
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,799
this so yeah I'm really like slowing my

512
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,740
my speed but anyway I'm on Amazon cool

513
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,140
hey I'm gonna shop there all I did was

514
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,440
go to Amazon uh what if we go to I don't

515
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,740
know let's go to eBay right

516
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,860
um go to eBay let that thing load up

517
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,179
here

518
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,400
note to self next time I do this I have

519
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,039
a faster connection okay so that is

520
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,559
going there we're going to pull up eBay

521
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,380
um let's do uh how about Target how

522
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,440
about Target let's uh Target right

523
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,620
public typing is not a great skill of

524
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,299
mine

525
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,179
um Target expect more

526
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,559
um what's someone what's give me another

527
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,020
give throw a sight at me somebody give

528
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,919
me

529
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,860
Facebook all right

530
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,918
all right

531
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,600
foreign

532
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
okay so I've went to what foresight I

533
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,440
just went to four places right how bad

534
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,419
could that be let's just take a look and

535
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,940
see how bad that is I opened this up and

536
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,600
now okay this is really not as bad as I

537
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,140
had anticipated right so you see all of

538
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,840
the this is just Target so all of these

539
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,840
are third-party cookies associated with

540
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,480
Target man if we keep going let's let's

541
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,460
just throw another side in there that's

542
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,820
going to connect those dots uh eBay how

543
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,200
about Etsy right

544
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,460
Etsy

545
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,340
um that'll work let's see then we go

546
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,580
back into this guy

547
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,539
refresh right

548
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,220

549
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,500
Facebook's out there

550
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,059
oh

551
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,320
that's what happens when you try to

552
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,179
hurry

553
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,020
okay come back here well Etsy popped in

554
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,000
well that's cool we'll just come flying

555
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,280
in from the side right okay so you've

556
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,559
got these little triangles here these

557
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,020
are third party cookies right there's

558
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,000
third party cookies associated with

559
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,539
Amazon eBay Target

560
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,720
Etsy as I continue if we had time I

561
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,820
would just open up a few bro eventually

562
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,260
this thing is going to look like

563
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,240
spaghetti and it says right there I've

564
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,460
only went to eight sites but I have 24

565
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,460
third party requests what the heck does

566
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,260
that mean well that means every time

567
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,380
that I go to these sites right

568
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,480
that cookie is there and it's going to

569
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,340
continue to track me across the internet

570
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,159
right now the other thing is this one

571
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,960
doesn't really show but some of these

572
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
are third-party referral cookies and

573
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,700
what that means is

574
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,419
uh let's say Amazon and Google right did

575
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,659
I even go to Google if I go to Google

576
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,700
and Amazon let's say Amazon and Google

577
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,080
are friends right

578
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,419
come on gig you can do it

579
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,240
hmm

580
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm gonna get you there I am but let's

581
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
say that Google and Amazon are um I

582
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,840
don't know why it's hanging way out

583
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,880
there it should come in there and play

584
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,440
and be part of the game but this is part

585
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,419
of the whole demo thing right

586
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,159
so

587
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,260
um what what Google and Amazon let's

588
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,720
just say and we all go to Google every

589
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,760
day right so you're gonna have the this

590
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,860
Google tracking cookie the analytics and

591
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,600
all those things with Google but Amazon

592
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,280
you might go there maybe like once a

593
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,080
month or maybe like every day like my

594
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,240
wife or something but if you went to

595
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,460
Amazon every uh if you go to Google

596
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,500
every day but you don't go to Amazon and

597
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,539
I say hey uh

598
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm Amazon you're Google I'm going to

599
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,520
pay you some money so that when people

600
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,659
go to Google will you renew my tracking

601
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,539
cookie so I can also continue to monitor

602
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,580
this internet activity because they're

603
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,620
not going to get there within 30 days so

604
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,240
if they don't come back within 30 days

605
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,299
my tracking cookie is going to expire so

606
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,059
help me out here's some cash and so over

607
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,120
time that's what's going to happen right

608
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,220
okay so again I am in a uh local browser

609
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,440
so let's get rid of this guy for a

610
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,740
second let's go into no let's not do

611
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,600
Chrome let's do Brave right there's a

612
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,659
ton of browsers out there I'm sure right

613
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,240
everyone's familiar privacy browsers

614
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,460
epic Brave Vivaldi

615
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,960
um all of them there's a there's a bunch

616
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,760
right

617
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,000
make this guy a little bigger oh you

618
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,279
were supposed to be off for this I'm

619
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,740
going to restart you

620
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,500
and I'm going to turn you off don't you

621
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,919
come yeah so hey I'm glad somebody knows

622
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,080
windscribe okay so the first thing I'm

623
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,679
gonna do here I am I'm in my VM Brave

624
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,440
browser use Brave only because if you go

625
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,480
on everyone looks at the settings and

626
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,120
you go down every single setting Brave

627
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,960
has a few more options I like it but

628
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,760
you know nothing's a hundred percent

629
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
right so let's do this first let's do am

630
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,360
I unique remember I am on a

631
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,039
um Linux

632
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,059
VM here and I'm basically using a Chrome

633
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,640
browser right Brave is based off

634
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
chromium right and so I'm going to say

635
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,700
hey

636
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,039
I might not have time to do all three of

637
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,159
these but I'll do at least this one to

638
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,020
show you so we can get to some other

639
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,740
things right so here I am uh I go to am

640
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,960
I unique and it's going to give me my

641
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,620
browser fingerprint it's going to say

642
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,080
this is wow this is like that at least

643
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,659
I'm bringing you back to the 1990 speed

644
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,760
that was kind of the whole intent of

645
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,620
this thing uh from the beginning right

646
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,240
yeah modem sound effects

647
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
um

648
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,659
yeah

649
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,880
who's on the phone okay so hopefully

650
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,440
this is going to come up here in a

651
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,299
second if not I'll just go back to the

652
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,760
slide and then I'll show you what it uh

653
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,640
what it says so it's going to say hey

654
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,860
I can see your operating system oh we're

655
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,960
almost there I can see your operating

656
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,100
system I can see what time zone you're

657
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,059
in and I can see what language you speak

658
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,100
and all those other attributes that I

659
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,140
was talking about like here

660
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,700
um your

661
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,020
your audio fingerprint your time zone

662
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,200
which is there canvas fingerprinting all

663
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
of the fonts oh that's a lot of

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
information that they're like looking at

665
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,720
me right it makes me a little uh

666
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,220
uncomfortable

667
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,200
um but let's just oh hey work with me

668
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
here right

669
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,580
I'm on a Linux machine and it says I'm

670
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,820
on a chrome on a Windows machine because

671
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,159
I have this user agent switcher that

672
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,020
shouldn't be on it should be off right

673
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,480
um but that's part one okay so there's

674
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,940
the things that we want to manage when

675
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,000
we go out we want to set this ahead of

676
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,159
time even before we click on our first

677
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,520
Google link right we want to say hey

678
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,220
I'm using this operating system I'm

679
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,100
using this browser I want to be in this

680
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,480
time zone I don't want you to know that

681
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,059
I speak English if you do UTC minus four

682
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,980
that is the Eastern time zone right

683
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,400
what's funny about this I'm connected to

684
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,679
a uh a VPN in Washington DC but I go to

685
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,500
Mi unique but it knows that I'm in the

686
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,020
Eastern uh well not Washington DC and

687
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,720
San Francisco I connect through a VPN in

688
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,799
San Francisco which could probably

689
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,020
account for my speed as well

690
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,320
that's not UTC -4 in San Francisco right

691
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,059
so what the these services do they're

692
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,679
like oh you're pulling the time from

693
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,260
your host well this information is sent

694
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,419
in my headers when I go and visit sites

695
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,580
so if I'm investigating something in

696
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,500
Ukraine isn't it going to look weird

697
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,360
when I pass this stuff in the header

698
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,820
it's like you say you're in Ukraine but

699
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,460
why is your in your language English and

700
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,380
why are you in the Eastern time zone

701
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,659
right so these are the things that we

702
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,760
kind of want to manipulate before we

703
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
start any kind of investigation and so

704
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,860
again

705
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,240
adding these extensions will

706
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,940
contribute to our uniqueness right but

707
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,200
you've got to figure out what you're

708
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,500
comfortable with right so if I have this

709
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,880
guy here it looks like it says I'm

710
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,200
already uh in a Windows right I'm on a

711
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,299
Linux machine obviously you saw that I'm

712
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,580
uh on a Linux box right there I'm sure

713
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,279
everyone's familiar with that but now

714
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,279
let's say hey let's manipulate two other

715
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,440
things right it's fine I want to be a

716
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,120
Windows machine on Chrome that's cool

717
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,820
I'll do that but I don't want to be in

718
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,980
the time zone where I'm actually sitting

719
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,159
and doing this work I need to match my

720
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,580
targets time zone so that I blend in

721
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,640
with local traffic I'm inside the Geo

722
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,179
fence right so there's another extension

723
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,860
that allows us to do that one of the

724
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,440
guys said it over here winscribe so what

725
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,659
I'm going to do is I'm going to look

726
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,520
through my settings of when please go

727
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,700
ahead

728
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,799
well you can't really hide it you just

729
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,539
have to pick the one that you want

730
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,740
because

731
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,720
then the sites aren't going to know how

732
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,000
to render the content to you based off

733
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
that user agent so you got to have one

734
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,539
you're just not letting them know which

735
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,679
one you want it to be

736
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,260
yes yes it can be

737
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,760
exactly yes you had a question sir

738
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,080
that's yep exactly what I just did right

739
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,220
so

740
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,840
um and I'm in the process of also

741
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
spoofing my user agent my time zone and

742
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,340
my language as well so those are the

743
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,879
things yes sir

744
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,760
how much the question is how much is the

745
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,000
uniqueness of the VM

746
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,620
and

747
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't know where do you have the same

748
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,620
VM that you put that that did

749
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,279
correct

750
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,980
it will right I am cloning from a

751
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,220
sourced VM my main image right but I

752
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,320
haven't passed any information sure

753
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,539
maybe the hardware characteristics are

754
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,919
going to be passed like it's going to

755
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,260
say that you're on a Mac with this user

756
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,020
agent uh and have some Hardware details

757
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,380
about that I configured in the VM sure

758
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,179
but that's stuff that we're still

759
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,880
managing right I have that ability to

760
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,140
not uh say or say what I want it to

761
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,700
to give I hope that helps

762
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,719
okay

763
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,480
no it's not going to change but there is

764
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,159
some ways that we can manipulate some

765
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,940
JavaScript and have it turn on or off uh

766
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,520
as we go from site to site to not have

767
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,919
some of that come up I hope that helps

768
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,539
I should have thrown out my my biggest

769
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,240
disclaimer like I'm not like a

770
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,140
um

771
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,940
super nation state hacker or anything

772
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,919
I'm just like this guy that just likes

773
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,539
to Tinker right

774
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:07,860
um done some of this work I didn't even

775
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,020
give my intro but you guys read it you

776
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,640
can say I'm kind of a big deal

777
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,620
um no I'm just kidding I'm not

778
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,480
um okay so windscribe let's go through

779
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,580
uh some of the settings in windscribe

780
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,620
right so if I go here and I go to

781
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,360
privacy right what I'm going to do is

782
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,980
say Okay

783
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,039
um I am blocking third party cookies

784
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,140
okay good let's block those third-party

785
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,940
cookies so that when I go to those sites

786
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,559
and then you would have to make sure

787
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,480
that this is actually happening if you

788
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,240
went back into the other extension it's

789
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
probably not and then you just have to

790
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,159
again clear them out or bring the New

791
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,860
Image down and start over right

792
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,580
um

793
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,179
location warp says hey

794
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,340
um fakes the location to your actual

795
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,100
Target area and then also my language

796
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,460
warp so now I'm saying

797
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,940
um I want to manipulate the time and the

798
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,039
language so let's go back into winscribe

799
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,659
and let's set those things right now I

800
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,240
said hey I'm in I want to say I'm in

801
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,580
Frankfurt and I speak German so if I hit

802
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,040
that and I turn that on and back into

803
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,379
settings you have the ability to do that

804
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,940
you can see hey you're now connected

805
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,300
right and so what should happen is when

806
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,980
I refresh this and after about you know

807
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,619
hopefully not five ten minutes this will

808
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,199
refresh I'll still have Windows and

809
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,580
chrome but this should have a different

810
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,119
time zone and this should say d e for

811
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,800
you know German

812
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,379
let's just see it'll probably bring me

813
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,260
back to the main page and then there

814
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,719
well that was way faster than I could

815
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,859
have imagined that that would have done

816
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,820
so now you can see I'm UTC plus two and

817
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,000
my default language is German and UTC

818
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,460
plus two is central eastern European

819
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,418
Time right so now I am pretty much set

820
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,940
to go I have if I'm doing an

821
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,760
investigation in Germany let me be in

822
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,520
the German time zone let me say that I'm

823
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,820
speaking German right and let me pick

824
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,420
the operating system and the browser of

825
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,760
choice so now I'm manipulating these

826
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,579
things uh so that

827
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,640
I can get the information I want I don't

828
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,480
have to accept the default information

829
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,900
based off my browsing history what's in

830
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,540
my cash my cookies my dom my sound

831
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,520
fingerprint because all of that's

832
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,220
already going to skew that so if I

833
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,320
manipulate this type of thing then I

834
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,300
have a better chance of having a

835
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,720
successful investigation right okay so

836
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,579
let's just say now

837
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,060
um that I have been able to do all of

838
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,640
this locally somehow on my network right

839
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,740
I've kind of created my isolation with

840
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,680
my VM right I've done some anonymity

841
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,720
around

842
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,339
um you know manipulating these

843
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,000
attributes again if I want to take that

844
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,579
a step further if I did have concerns

845
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,940
like I'm not really this is good this is

846
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,160
really good it's way better than

847
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,760
um

848
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,339
what a lot of small medium-sized

849
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,599
organizations coming most of them we've

850
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,099
talked to some people will say hey how

851
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,180
are you doing your investigation today

852
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,380
well I'm blocked on the corporate

853
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,300
Network and uh basically I just get on

854
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,400
my iPad and you know I just go to town

855
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,040
that way oh that's perfect right well

856
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,420
how do you do you create any kind of

857
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,520
virtual Persona no just use my real

858
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,200
Facebook page and I just man I'm I'm

859
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,540
killing it I am killing it today right

860
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,540
and they are they are I mean but at what

861
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,760
cost right what cost so now I've got

862
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
kind of the isolation here right to

863
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,020
manage my how I'm looking but if I

864
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,300
wanted to take it a step further right

865
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,060
what could I do well I would get the

866
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,180
code that runs locally through my

867
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,660
network and executes on my endpoint now

868
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,940
let's take it to the cloud right and

869
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,079
then we're going to let the cloud

870
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,420
service kind of manage our backups our

871
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,040
cloning

872
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,260
um snapshots and all of those things

873
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,359
right so if I just go here now and and

874
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,280
let's just bring this guy up that's

875
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,960
really bad resolution but you know it'll

876
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,480
work I called it demo hope hoping this

877
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,680
demo would work

878
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,480
and uh

879
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,740
so far

880
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,160
I'd give it about a 90. percent here

881
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,579
okay so now oh it actually doesn't look

882
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,380
that bad up there it looks like it's

883
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,859
anyway yeah so now here I am I have a uh

884
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:38,040
digital ocean droplet spun up right just

885
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,880
to put a Ubuntu box up there 2204 Jimmy

886
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,560
Jammy right uh got all of that

887
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,720
basically you know stack overflowed how

888
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
to get it running and just copy and

889
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,859
pasted some commands and boom and there

890
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,920
I am I'm running away right so now I'm

891
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,820
gonna do the exact same things that I

892
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,960
was doing locally but I'm gonna do it in

893
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,180
the cloud I'm going to create snapshots

894
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,460
digital ocean I'm sure you guys know you

895
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,619
can create the snapshot use that

896
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,320
snapshot for this investigation snapshot

897
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,540
off the original it puts a new little

898
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,820
squares boom boom boom you just do the

899
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,560
same thing but now you're doing it in

900
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,440
the cloud and you're ensuring that you

901
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,720
have that isolation because nothing is

902
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,760
going to run locally on your machine

903
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,060
right so basically it's the same thing

904
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,339
I've created my snapshots I'm about to

905
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,560
do an investigation I'm going to just go

906
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,260
straight out to my browser uh and I'm

907
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,780
going to add those extensions I'm going

908
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,180
to get everything set to do this

909
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,020
investigation uh yeah this is also a

910
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,660
very minimal VM not a lot of ram going

911
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,599
on there but you can see when scribes

912
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,660
already uh connected right or as it says

913
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,540
you are so very much yeah okay cool here

914
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,460
activate that and take me take me to

915
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,920
Germany give me my user agent yeah okay

916
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,140
let's just see am I unique let's take a

917
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
quick look and see how I have set myself

918
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,320
this is an un Ubuntu machine right

919
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
running just like the other one

920
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,220
this should probably run a little

921
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,020
quicker because I'm running you know

922
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,540
from a cloud but you know I didn't put a

923
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,579
lot of a horsepower into this so there

924
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,260
we go right

925
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,520
I am speaking German I'm in just UTC

926
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,060
zero right GMT time I said I'm an apple

927
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,300
machine I am on Apple machine but I'm in

928
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,520
a Linux VM in the cloud so now this is

929
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,940
where this is my starting point this is

930
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,599
my sterile environment for me to start

931
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,740
right I can build a Persona I have my

932
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,859
burner phone I'm getting my two Factor

933
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:56,280
I'm integrating I'm uh you know

934
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,940
um

935
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,760
you know integrating interacting with

936
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,300
particular individuals right I can do

937
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,099
all of these things now because I've

938
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,020
started a clean environment and I

939
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,660
continue on with the investigation and

940
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,320
uh until it's complete and then we

941
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,180
archive it and we start completely over

942
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,740
again

943
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,140
um a lot of work to do this right could

944
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,780
you imagine having to do this for an

945
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,900
organization of a hundred people 300 a

946
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,960
thousand people right this solution is

947
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,420
good two or three people maybe at a

948
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,579
small law enforcement place right but

949
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,260
what if you had a thousand people like

950
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,460
this just doesn't necessarily scale that

951
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,380
well right it can be done

952
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,119
but it's just probably not the best way

953
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,640
to do it so this is my Shameless plug I

954
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,920
was listening to uh to Quaid over there

955
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,540
with his Shameless plug I was like you

956
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,040
know what Quaid had a good thing he had

957
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,240
a Shameless plug at the end I'm gonna

958
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,820
have to steal that well I work for

959
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,800
authenticate and what we do is we do

960
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
manage attribution uh with the network

961
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,320
as a service right so if you're

962
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,880
interested in that come up and talk to

963
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,680
me got some cards we basically just

964
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,359
automate this whole thing where you

965
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,940
click a button you select languages you

966
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,040
select your user agent you select uh

967
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
your time zone

968
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,839
some automated Tools in there as well

969
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,900
um but yes that's kind of what we do

970
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,280
um this is this is what I have I've got

971
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,140
about 15 minutes left which is exactly

972
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,619
where I wanted to be I

973
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,900
do have a couple of prizes to give up

974
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,599
they said I only have two so

975
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,260
um

976
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,119
the first one I'd give out is like okay

977
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,740
I'm going to ask the question it's

978
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,420
pretty simple and then this is your lock

979
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,000
pit kit who learned something today

980
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,400
right there saw this guy right here in

981
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,500
the red that was easy okay and uh okay

982
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,480
the other one is

983
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,460
somebody tell me

984
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,540
um

985
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,119
what was the most useful piece of

986
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,260
information that you learned today

987
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,140

990
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,820
um any other questions that we can

991
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,339
answer I know it's a Saturday people

992
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,140
want to watch some football

993
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,220
um

994
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,959
what do you have yes sir

995
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,579
yeah no I mean that's that's just kind

996
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,859
of yeah uh you know DuckDuckGo is just a

997
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,119
you know they say they're a privacy

998
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,040
browser there was some article not too

999
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,140
long ago that said what they they kind

1000
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,420
of leaked that's why I kind of

1001
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,740
um that's kind of why I just went to

1002
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,240
start page there's a bunch of these

1003
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,400
private search engines um you know I

1004
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,720
can't remember them off top of my head

1005
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,420
but start page duckduckgoer are kind of

1006
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,440
just better

1007
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,359
I'll say they're better but Google's an

1008
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,940
advertising company right I know but and

1009
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,680
how does an advertising company make

1010
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,160
money they sell your information so from

1011
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,740
an investigation point of view you might

1012
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,599
want to start with one of these others

1013
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,820
or not because you're not you're going

1014
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,619
to always start with a sterile

1015
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,680
environment I do like DuckDuckGo for

1016
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,500
when I need to Google something right

1017
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,420
because I will use a bang operator you

1018
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,000
guys know the bang operator right so in

1019
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,940
the DuckDuckGo page uh

1020
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,400
here let me just do it like this I'll go

1021
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,579
to a traditional browser don't judge

1022
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,099
right we're going to go here I'm going

1023
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,740
to go here uh let me do this real quick

1024
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,680
I'll do so there's DuckDuckGo right so

1025
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,740
if I do a exclamation or what they call

1026
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,099
a bang G right that's Google if I do a

1027
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,319
GM that's Google Maps and you can see

1028
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,119
all of them when you hit the exclamation

1029
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,660
point and so what that kind of does is

1030
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,680
instead of

1031
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,280
Bob looking for cars and searching it on

1032
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,339
Google DuckDuckGo would say or yeah

1033
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:51,240
Google would see DuckDuckGo is looking

1034
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,720
for cars somewhere right not not me or

1035
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,700
even cares you know something like that

1036
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,800
so I that's one thing I like to use is

1037
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,660
kind of like a duck duck go on instead

1038
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,700
of a Google but because Google is so

1039
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,859
robust and this searches are great I

1040
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,560
will just do a bang G and say hey

1041
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,599
Google thinks that goes it at least

1042
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,500
that's what I think yes sir

1043
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,480
I guess

1044
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,880
it's worse right and so that's I'm thank

1045
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,180
you for that so if you sign in to any of

1046
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,400
your socials and you just leave that

1047
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,960
open right especially like when you sign

1048
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,460
into your Gmail and then you go to

1049
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,319
YouTube it you know how it says you're

1050
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,380
automatically uh commenting as Bob right

1051
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,480
and then you're signed into Facebook and

1052
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,960
I was like you're your cookies are gonna

1053
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,040
uh

1054
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,440
they're gonna they're still gonna pursue

1055
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,700
I mean they're still gonna draw

1056
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,260
attention

1057
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,000
um with whether you're not signed in but

1058
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,339
when you're signed in now you're really

1059
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,980
you're giving the identity of who you

1060
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,280
are explicitly it's the way I see that

1061
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,240
right yes sir

1062
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,339
no not all uh yeah so

1063
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,140
um so

1064
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,060
all right there's obviously a lot of

1065
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,579
information out on on the internet right

1066
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,560
and you know like Mike bazelle I always

1067
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,240
quote this guy if you guys remember him

1068
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,339
he's like the OG of oscent back in the

1069
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:26,099
day right he's got a lot of good content

1070
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:29,760
he's got a great podcast uh a lot of uh

1071
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,359
Discord channels and slack but from a

1072
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,079
personal way it's like when I see uh if

1073
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,599
I'm searching for a particular function

1074
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,460
and I wonder if there's an extension

1075
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,380
that could give that to me then the

1076
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,359
first thing I do is I go and I read the

1077
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,260
developers you know uh description where

1078
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,300
are they based right you know if they're

1079
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,579
based in the U.S or even Canada I'm okay

1080
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,560
but maybe if it's based somewhere

1081
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,260
overseas in a location that I am not too

1082
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,599
comfortable with doing and then I will

1083
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,000
actually go into those Discord channels

1084
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,980
and go hey has anybody tested this

1085
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,599
winscribe thing does anybody really know

1086
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,220
about it and then people will come back

1087
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,380
and go oh yeah winscribe it's cool I've

1088
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,940
used it for about 10 years or whatever

1089
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,520
and so that's just kind of because the

1090
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,160
ocent open source Community that's we

1091
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,099
want to share tools and knowledge

1092
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,980
um you know like oscent Curious Trace

1093
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,900

1096
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,900
um oscent channels that are there but uh

1097
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,180

1098

just fun and like that's a good thing

1108
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,380
about like Trace Labs a good plug for

1109
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,819
them thank you for that

1110
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,560
um if you're not like really

1111
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,640
um

1112
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,740
comfortable in doing this or you you

1113
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,720
know don't have a lot of experience the

1114
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,240
trace Labs uh CTF that the whole I think

1115
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,740
it's once or twice a year they just put

1116
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,020
you in a team with people and you just

1117
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,079
say hey look I'm I'm new to all this I'm

1118
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,660
just here to learn uh most of the

1119
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,640
community is pretty receptive yeah hey

1120
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,339
I'm looking for a team to join

1121
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:31,140
um and before the actual CTF kicks off

1122
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,060
um you you find your team and then you

1123
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,000
you know kind of figure out what each of

1124
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,180
your strengths are going into it but

1125
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,619
I've done it for a couple of years in a

1126
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:41,819
row I just actually started doing it I

1127
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:43,680
had so much fun now you're probably not

1128
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,740
gonna win I never win but

1129
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,720
um but you gain a lot of experience and

1130
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,119
then you learn about other resources

1131
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,520
that people bring into the into the game

1132
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,000
for you

1133
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,020
anything else yes

1134
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,280
what are those

1135
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,200
so the question is how do you basically

1136
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,079
compare the anonymity of Tor versus the

1137
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,619
VPN a premier VPN service oh not just a

1138
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,300
Premiere

1139
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,000
um so Tor you know is uh the tour

1140
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,880
project a tour browser you know it was

1141
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,400
built with anonymity from the from day

1142
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,040
one you know the Navy guys had needed

1143
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,900
some way back in the day to communicate

1144
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,440
uh anonymously so they wouldn't know

1145
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,760
um

1146
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,819
tour is fine right but you don't want to

1147
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:42,119
use Tor to do anything obviously

1148
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,099
personal because of the activity that

1149
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,160
takes place on the dark web so

1150
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,839
um a good thing to do like is when you

1151
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:50,940
build a cloud VM

1152
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,780
um

1153
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,300
Brave has a way that you can just open

1154
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,160
onion links you hit the little hamburger

1155
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,020
menu and you know copy and paste the

1156
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,240
onion Link in there you could use it

1157
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,060
that way but yeah it's it's

1158
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,339
it provides Fair anyone please got more

1159
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:08,460
information on the tour provides a great

1160
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,400
degree of anonymity

1161
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,160
and a VPN it depends on the VPN service

1162
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,200
right if you guys probably know like it

1163
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,460
depends on what

1164
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,500
what they log some of them say that on

1165
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,180
an even log but

1166
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,599
here's my issue with vpns is that vpns

1167
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,339
are associated with data centers right

1168
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,160
so what takes place on vpns is like a

1169
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,960
lot of Nefarious activity right that's

1170
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,819
why you get hit with catches all the

1171
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,500
time right because you're connected to

1172
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,839
the VPN and it'll say something looks

1173
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,160
weird once you rotate this elephant

1174
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,560
until he stands on his feet can you find

1175
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,660
all the ladders or is this a bike right

1176
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,960
so there are good vpns out there like

1177
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,140
proton VPN I would just research the

1178
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,460
vpns but how do you compare them I just

1179
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,220
think they're kind of two different

1180
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,660
um

1181
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,819
places right I don't know how to state

1182
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:03,800
that but if I yeah please go ahead

1183
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,119
ah yes

1184
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,339
so when I did the uniqueness thank you

1185
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,800
when I did the uniqueness test on one of

1186
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,560
these Pages it'll identify it as a Tor

1187
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,319
exit node and you don't know that you're

1188
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,020
on that tour exit node and then you get

1189
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,359
flagged that's why sometimes with a with

1190
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,940
these particular Services you get you

1191
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,460
get all these harassments of just trying

1192
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:41,060
to you know remember your anniversary

1193
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,800
no the Shameless plug again yes

1194
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,460
yeah

1195
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,280
so he said your VPN one thing you might

1196
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,859
notice is that it's a sketchy data

1197
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:00,839
center where it's hosted which is not

1198
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:02,579
even gonna you know

1199
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:05,880
it's not helping you at all so uh anyway

1200
