1
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,200
it's amazing my dress has pockets I'm so

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,059
glad

3
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,460
all right as I said before but now that

4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,899
you can actually hear me my name is

5
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,280
Rachel Jones

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,079
um I wanted to introduce myself a little

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,300
bit because this uh topic is really near

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,800
and dear to my heart and has really

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
followed my career these past 10 years

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,559
yes I'm old I know it's sad but um the

11
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,120
reason I put this slide up here I'm

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,680
currently a cyber Analyst at Savannah

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,739
River National Lab I'm getting a my PhD

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,620
in Aerospace science I'm very excited

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,619
and focused about uh satellite cyber

16
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,479
security which is a subject I don't

17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,420
think we talk about enough of but uh

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,040
before we get into that I kind of want

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
to take you guys 10 years ago when I

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,979
first heard of satellite cyber security

21
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,659
I was actually a

22
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,280
I was at the International Space

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,799
University yes I know such a university

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,140
exists it's for a bunch of space nerds

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,659
uh it's in Strasbourg France we had

26
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,600
about 47 students from 45 different

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,259
nations it was great and one of those I

28
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,820
was one of the eight selected for the

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
U.S to go to this University I felt

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,860
really excited and I was going to use my

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,840
powers to really influence the space

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,460
world

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,860
and that's when I heard about this this

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,900
is probably one of the coolest things uh

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,060
if you guys ever like for fun read uh

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,759
economic papers on us and China you

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,159
might have came across this oh if you

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,960
don't don't worry

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,420
um a lot of people didn't so this was uh

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,759
the first time I'd ever heard about a

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,860
satellite being hacked and not just one

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,020
satellite this was two satellites

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,720
getting hacked four different times and

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,640
the first time this actually appeared in

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,340
public was in this U.S to China report

46
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,000
to Congress it was published in 2011 but

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,520
supposedly the hacks happened about 2007

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,580
and 2008 and for those that don't know a

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,739
lot about satellites there's there's two

50
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,580
different types of hacking let's say in

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,680
this article it tries to distinguish the

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,959
landsat 7 which is a weather satellite

53
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,200
from NASA and the Terra am satellite

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,780
which is also a weather satellite I know

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,180
Minor Details but in one case with the

56
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,400
Terra they actually were able to take

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,680
over command and control

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,200
for that satellite which means in theory

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,780
that the attackers were able to actually

60
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,879
move the satellite and could reposition

61
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,459
it for their needs now this is 10 years

62
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,040
ago me so please forgive me

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
um I'm like oh my God this is the

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,340
coolest thing ever I can't believe they

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,260
can do that for satellites I didn't

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,700
really think about some of the questions

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,760
that my classmates had like well how'd

68
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,680
they do that I'm like I don't know but

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,440
this report said it happened yes

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
that's all we needed to know

71
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,819
but there was a lot of questions back

72
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,459
then no one knew how it was accomplished

73
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,280
no one knew if it was accomplished uh

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,620
we'd have a lot of conflicting ideas on

75
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,440
this and from those ideas we kind of

76
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,640
looked at

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,680
I decided Well what do space

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,659
professionals believe you know the

79
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,159
people that are actually building the

80
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,099
satellites controlling the satellites I

81
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,200
mean do they think the cyber security of

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,480
satellites is a risk and this is back in

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,180
2012 so it's not modern day and all

84
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,340
these ugly wonderful things I'll get

85
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,739
into hadn't happened yet and one of my

86
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,840
questions was is it's an international

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
environment if you think about moving

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,620
the command and control of one satellite

89
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,599
you could actually Ram it into another

90
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,140
ones yes uh that would create an

91
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,599
international issue in this environment

92
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,239
means that one thing being insecure

93
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,480
would affect other things around it so

94
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,400
you really want to have like all the

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,739
things be secure this isn't just make

96
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,139
sure your company is good but imagine if

97
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,519
you're another company that you have to

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,560
make sure all the other companies are

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,660
good too so that your things aren't

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,180
damaged so with satellites that are very

101
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,979
Dynamic different ways of looking at

102
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,860
their security needs so I wanted to do a

103
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
survey of the space professionals and

104
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,620
really look at what do they believe

105
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,479
I mean you can have all the policies in

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,860
the world but if you don't actually have

107
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,540
people that believe in those policies

108
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,300
and are willing to actually follow the

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
policies it doesn't mean much so my

110
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,440
survey back when in 2012 looked at

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,419
things like

112
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,400
what do they actually think the threats

113
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,280
were so the first and yes I know this is

114
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,160
an eye test so I hope you can see so I

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,780
first wanted to know what did they

116
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,280
actually think were the three biggest

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,740
threats to satellites in orbit this is

118
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,400
2012 I surveyed about 135 different

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,660
people in 22 different countries and

120
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,479
most of my results were from Europe and

121
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,759
North America but I did get a good

122
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
represented at least like five percent

123
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,780
from other nations and I divided them

124
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,080
geographically to be Asia South

125
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
South America and Africa kind of make

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
sure I got the little bit of everyone

127
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,139
and these were the three things that

128
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,780
they thought were the most important

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,220
risk to satellite so space debris

130
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,199
Collision space weather mechanical

131
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,080
failure now you notice I'll have a lot

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,479
of other things up here lasers from the

133
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,539
ground uh asteroid Collision uh what

134
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,240
actually got pretty high up there 11

135
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,660
computer failure due to user error

136
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,479
I like that one

137
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,800
um and then I asked a couple other

138
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,240
questions

139
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
space professionals do you think a

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
satellite you could actually get data

141
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,660
from it yes I know I wish I could have

142
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,220
rewarded those questions I would have

143
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,199
done it a little bit different but I

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,699
asked them do they think that a

145
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,639
satellite could be hacked likely 34

146
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,500
percent all right

147
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,240
do you think someone could get command

148
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,039
and control of a satellite like I told

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,039
about earlier most of them didn't think

150
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,840
that was likely I'm like the government

151
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,300
report said so

152
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
but no they still didn't believe it uh

153
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm not going to share all the questions

154
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,300
with you I just kind of picked out six

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,580
that I thought were most interesting so

156
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,699
I thought attribution do you think you

157
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,560
could prove one person actually hacked

158
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
it

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,620
yeah

160
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,819
we kind of got no on that one

161
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,500
and then three other questions I was

162
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,120
going to share with you

163
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,180
um if an attack on a satellite happened

164
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,220
uh do you think it should be announced

165
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,720
publicly you have this commercial

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
satellite that was attacked should they

167
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
actually have some announcement in the

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,259
public that it was attacked

169
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,120
I don't want to say 50 50 because it's

170
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,660
not but it was pretty close here 45 to

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,600
41. who should investigate if a

172
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,220
satellite gets an attack

173
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,139
most people thought the country of

174
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,060
registration but you can see it's

175
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,259
closely followed by an international

176
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,800
organization and then my favorite

177
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,020
should there be security minimums for

178
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,099
satellites 68 said yes

179
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,440
all right since then

180
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,139
what has happened today I'm going to go

181
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,020
over probably the four biggest we got

182
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,900
three papers and one course that kind of

183
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,639
really describes the modern literature

184
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,259
coming from about 2019 to to current

185
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,840
and these really go over kind of what is

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,180
going on in this satellite cyber

187
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,000
security field uh this first paper I

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,740
recommend it just because it's a really

189
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,539
good basic and primer for people that

190
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,220
might not know satellite cyber security

191
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,620
and what we're talking about here and I

192
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,300
bring this up because I really want to

193
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,860
explain you you have different

194
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,680
components when you talk about where the

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,000
weaknesses is and where the

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
vulnerabilities are I like to say my

197
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,139
professor says if you really want to

198
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,819
work the cyber security of satellites

199
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,340
you have to know the space side and the

200
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,099
Cyber side almost equally that's why I'm

201
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,740
getting my PhD in Aerospace science and

202
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,319
others are getting their phds in cyber

203
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,720
so really here this breaks down the

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,900
segments um space segment ground segment

205
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,360
user segment they don't spell it out but

206
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,039
there's also a link segment how the

207
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,899
satellites and ground actually talk to

208
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,779
each other in this paper here spells out

209
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,080
a new trend they say in the past mostly

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,820
it has been like jamming attacks from

211
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,919
the ground to the satellite but now

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,140
we've actually seen more space basic

213
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,180
attacks so we're going from satellite to

214
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,399
attacking other satellites and that's

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,560
the rising Trend but this paper also

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,180
calls out some really good things about

217
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,580
what we're doing to protect Satellites

218
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,620
with the new use of software-defined

219
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,720
radios and other methodologies that

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,760
we're going in to harden the Cyber

221
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,279
Electronics aboard them

222
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,680
so moving on

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,899
this next paper I don't know if you know

224
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,240
Aerospace Corporation but they're kind

225
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,060
of like a think tank for the dod and

226
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,880
they produce this paper was really nice

227
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,800
um

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,180
kind of explains the Gambit of things

229
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,339
and if you notice in this paper it

230
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,019
actually breaks out the different types

231
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,360
of attacks used in each segment of the

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,820
space infrastructure so you got attacks

233
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,620
that are common to the space segment the

234
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,660
user segment the link segment and the

235
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,760
ground segment so what's going after

236
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
these guys

237
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000
foreign

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,060
and now yeah this is an eye chart I just

239
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,740
wanted to throw you what it looks like

240
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,800
in the paper but this paper really goes

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,740
good to lay out the policies and the

242
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,959
guidelines that are being developed for

243
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,480
the space cyber security field so if you

244
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,580
want more this is the paper that's the

245
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,760
chart

246
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,899
now this paper is probably one of my

247
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,420
favorites okay

248
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,920
so

249
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,080
a lot of attacks have been said in the

250
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,200
media going against satellites anyone

251
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
ever heard of any of these attacks right

252
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839
here you got the compromise of the NASA

253
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,720
jet propulsion lab uh remember I talked

254
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
about the landsat seven up there the

255
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
NOAA observation

256
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,100
this paper makes claim that none of the

257
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,500
attacks ever happened

258
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,320
I know it's really fun um I I don't want

259
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,180
to say this is a great conspiracy paper

260
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,060
read but it shows you the other side of

261
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,480
what to think about so most of the

262
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,339
reporting for various instances

263
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,440
reference classified documents that

264
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,660
people don't have access to they

265
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,240
reference things that are disputed so

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,459
when I talk about the landsat 7

267
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,700
it was actually supposedly done by a

268
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,459
compromise of a ground station and what

269
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,079
this author did was they actually talked

270
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,220
to the ground station the ground

271
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,100
station's like no that didn't happen

272
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,660
and they're like we don't know what the

273
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,760
government's talking about and it just

274
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,860
kind of shows you the other side when

275
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,720
you're investigating instances like this

276
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,079
did it really happen it's hard to know

277
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,880
because not a lot of people want to talk

278
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,360
about it

279
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,620
and uh the final thing I'll mention here

280
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,060
is this uh this is a Class by aiaa and

281
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,160
they give a good breakdown and one of

282
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
the good things that they actually

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
developed is the space domain cyber

284
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,500
security framework that kind of lists

285
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,660
the various segments and the different

286
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,060
tacts that correlate to those segments

287
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,220
and what you're going to be targeting

288
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,839
they're a different way of laying out

289
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
the framework and kind of going at it

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,500
and these are some of their good case

291
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,740
studies of cyber attacks to satellites

292
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,440
there might be some overlap between the

293
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,060
last slide and this side

294
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,880
but it's really interesting and I call

295
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,040
this out particularly because when

296
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,660
you're dealing with a space environment

297
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,940
which is an environment that's not here

298
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,019
terrestrally you have a different

299
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,760
outside influences that you might not

300
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,339
have with computers here yes it's

301
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,200
possible statistically a lot of things

302
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,540
but when you're dealing with radiation

303
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,440
impacts to non-hardened cyber materials

304
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,380
you have a component called bit flip so

305
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,660
I don't know if how familiar with you

306
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,019
guys but if you hit a a bit it actually

307
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,600
flips the zero to a one or vice versa

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,420
for some reason coders tell me that that

309
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,000
messes up with their code or something I

310
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,180
don't know why they can't just like deal

311
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,579
with that but there's environmental

312
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,779
impacts of being an extreme cold hot you

313
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,880
know radiation inducing environment that

314
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,680
we just don't have here on Earth and

315
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,079
these make it really hard I mean I know

316
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,940
there's a lot of blue teamers forensics

317
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,579
analysts in here well do you know if

318
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,260
that's an attacker or is that just an

319
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,079
environmental bit flip did they did

320
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,060
someone purposely go into that or did

321
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,000
something else happen and I like this

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,620
publication and what they put out

323
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,720
because they really analyzed what does

324
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,180
those other things look like where do we

325
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,120
need to go and what can or how we can

326
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,820
just stimulate between the two

327
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,399
but you know I I really wanted to see

328
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,480
hey

329
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
it's been 10 years I wonder what space

330
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,079
profession

331
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,940
now that we have all these lovely

332
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,279
documents and we've had new case studies

333
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,380
like you know the bias act that just

334
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,420
happened we had the you know Defcon

335
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,060
presentation of the SDR going on taking

336
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,160
over the Canadian decommissioned

337
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,180
satellite

338
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,220
I wonder what space professionals think

339
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,519
now

340
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,899
well

341
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,760
I can tell you one thing

342
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,740
cyber's up on the list

343
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,860
looking back we now have the the top

344
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,560
three threats to satellites

345
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,779
cyber is actually number three

346
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,760
and just because I don't think you'd

347
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,220
remember what the you know random bar

348
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,260
charts I showed you two seconds or five

349
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,820
minutes ago looks like I have them

350
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,160
compared up here

351
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,160
um so with this survey it went out to

352
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,040
space professionals I got a total of 130

353
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
respondents it was done anonymously so I

354
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,019
don't know who the respondents are I can

355
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,120
tell you most of them about 50 percent

356
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,880
were from North America

357
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,920
Europe and South America were the the

358
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,420
second leading contributors and um

359
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,940
because uh my survey skills have

360
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,880
improved from SurveyMonkey I I was now

361
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,220
able to also add some other categories

362
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,060
which is really nice because I got some

363
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,980
great responses in the other categories

364
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,100
one of which I'm pretty sure if I had

365
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,680
included it it would have dramatically

366
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,560
changed my entire survey they said the

367
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,360
best way to kill a satellite is to

368
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,579
destroy its funding

369
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,920
um

370
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,199
I uh I think they won but I was talking

371
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,880
about once this satellite was actually

372
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,760
in orbit and successful

373
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,940
not that it can't be killed by funding

374
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,500
moving on

375
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,300
um

376
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,459
the first question you know we went a

377
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,440
little bit of change uh whenever you do

378
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,139
statistics and study numbers uh we use

379
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,600
the word significant to actually mean

380
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
something uh it's greater than one

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,920
standard deviation away

382
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,459
and uh I also like to look at like what

383
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,279
the the shape it makes

384
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,440
so you see this one is actually a little

385
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,519
bit more than the others because the the

386
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,440
other options were a little bit less

387
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,959
here but if you look down here

388
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,660
kind of get like two bumps now

389
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,060
that's because

390
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,940
before when everyone said not likely if

391
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,100
you notice all the other choices yeah

392
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,519
all of them were below 20 well now we

393
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,800
have 32 and 33 that actually like almost

394
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,680
half and half yes or no they're a little

395
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,320
bit torn here and you can see the space

396
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
professionals don't know

397
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,459
uh they they think they could have but

398
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,420
more likely

399
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,120
moving on to the next few questions if

400
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,940
we look at it here we we still have the

401
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,880
same about half and half yes and no but

402
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,100
uh mandatory reporting has actually

403
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,860
increased a little bit

404
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,360
if you compare it to our 45 yes 41 no we

405
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,899
now have 52 yes and 34 no if you do the

406
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,899
math it's not a significant change but

407
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,180
it does does show that there is change

408
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,040
in the market and there is change in the

409
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,759
ideas and that they might be receptive

410
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,360
um to policy implications

411
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,279
here um

412
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,040
it's I promise this has been 10 years

413
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,620
but it does look almost similar to the

414
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,139
one done in

415
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,779
2012 for the which country or which

416
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,839
entity should be

417
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,699
investigating a possible hack to a

418
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,199
satellite

419
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
but the biggest change is the the number

420
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,339
of people that actually thinks a

421
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,199
mandatory security minimum should be

422
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,579
implicated

423
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,500
so we go from a 68 to an 84 percent

424
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,780
big numbers and I'm really glad they

425
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,660
feel that way

426
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,439
because

427
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,579
there is

428
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,919
current policy in the work that is

429
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,080
looking towards

430
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,140
um creating better communication and

431
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,299
better guidance for cyber security of

432
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,460
satellites so

433
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,440
I brought this up for these are the most

434
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,080
relevant policy documents that deal with

435
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,320
the cyber security of satellites

436
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,940
spd5 and then there's actually an

437
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,039
upcoming nist framework that's

438
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,200
specifically going to address it it's in

439
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
draft two

440
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,539
um

441
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,059
it closed for comments in early spring

442
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,460
so I'm not sure what we're waiting on

443
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,200
but I'm hoping that it'll come out soon

444
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
for a fullness document or another draft

445
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,480
and I've also included some wonderful

446
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
sayings of people that will say things

447
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,799
firmer than I will

448
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,380
uh because I'm glad they said it and can

449
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,419
be attributed and I don't have to be

450
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,500
all right

451
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,080
now uh if you want to study this

452
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
yourself

453
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,980
I uh I actually have a lot of references

454
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,080
up here I know you guys are so excited

455
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,600
for your Academia work

456
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,380
and then even more whoo

457
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,440
but uh I I figured I went through that a

458
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,539
little fast just because I know we were

459
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,520
trying to make up on time

460
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,379
um but I'm open for questions

461
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,419
and I have some giveaways for good

462
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,720
questions

463
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,020
uh how

464
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,419
can we apply our current things like

465
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,419
agents to the satellites and what limits

466
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,740
or issues would go along with that

467
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
okay uh when you say agents do you mean

468
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,780
operators builders

469
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,860
security agents

470
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,720
well that's an interesting question

471
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,559
uh

472
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,559
you can

473
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,660
it depends on which component you're

474
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,660
trying to verify for example uh nowadays

475
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,700
ground stations which are the devices

476
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,440
that are actually used to control the

477
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,539
satellite or monitor the satellite can

478
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,120
be made by a local high schooler anyone

479
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,799
can make a ground station to actually

480
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,380
look at the footprint of a satellite but

481
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,880
ground stations that are used to command

482
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,000
and control are completely different

483
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,500
those ground stations are supposedly

484
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,100
more secure but they're also on the

485
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,880
cloud

486
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,940
uh there are Amazon web services that

487
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,179
offers uh ground stations for satellites

488
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,000
that you can do from anywhere

489
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,580
so the same applications that you would

490
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,280
use for creating a secure Cloud

491
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,260
infrastructure could be utilized in the

492
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,120
ground station for that but really it's

493
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,919
building it with security in mind from

494
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,140
the beginning

495
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,700
many satellites are created by

496
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,539
universities by other countries they're

497
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,440
created by anyone that really can afford

498
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,720
to put it up there I mean I think you

499
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,360
could you as an individual wanted to put

500
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,220
up a satellite and you had a spare I

501
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,620
don't know thirty thousand dollars you

502
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,299
could

503
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,020
um and right now it's not limited to

504
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,000
what you could put up there except by

505
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,580
the launch provider

506
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,100
that's it so you pay enough money and

507
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,860
you can make it happen

508
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,600
I know doesn't that make you feel warm

509
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,080
and fuzzy

510
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,260
like

511
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,940
they're putting up a lot more satellites

512
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,940
to cover internet is that proliferation

513
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,580
going to have other impacts as well it's

514
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,679
a really broad question sorry

515
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,059
no that that's a

516
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,780
lot it is and and you're really dealing

517
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,000
with two different issues here so the

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,500
number of satellites and the different

519
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
orbits in space that that's one issue

520
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,980
that's actually delegated by the um itu

521
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,539
International telecommunications Union

522
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,760
they they monitor what orbits they can

523
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
be there and when you're talking about

524
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
Leo satellites which is where we're

525
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,039
finding the large

526
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,380
constellations you're you're looking at

527
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,100
um

528
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,039
most of those they now have a mandated

529
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
de-orbit period so they're really

530
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,520
getting up there quickly and they're

531
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,840
really hopefully

532
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,880
coming down quickly or at least with a

533
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,360
plan but uh your very limited orbits are

534
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
your Geo satellites in a very special

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
geosynchronous range and that's actually

536
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,059
a political nightmare because uh the

537
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,860
allocation for those are very

538
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,440
competitive and getting them up there

539
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,740
and making sure they come down is a huge

540
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,659
ordeal

541
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,280
um so but then you're also dealing with

542
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,020
frequency Wars I don't know if you've

543
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,820
heard that uh but the frequency

544
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,980
allocation here in the U.S I'm actually

545
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,200
getting some popcorn I'm enjoying

546
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,059
watching the debates uh every now and

547
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,679
then they'll have an auction I'm just

548
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,419
like ooh is starlink gonna lose

549
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,320
everything

550
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,900
is our 5G gonna lose everything let's

551
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,840
see who wins so you're dealing with a

552
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,140
very congested environment and um the

553
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,120
first come first serve doesn't really

554
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,500
always hold true there

555
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,220
kind of crowd sourcing

556
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,440
your hand test security because I know

557
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,659
there's been open competitions like

558
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,820
Hackensack and

559
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,880
swap my Society

560
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,679
are they

561
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,480
interested in the results of those kinds

562
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,340
of things to integrate that in or is

563
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,960
I have to say it really depends on the

564
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,980
company

565
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,900
um some of my my classmates actually

566
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
went on to found Spire which is a

567
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,360
cubesat company and I I know from my

568
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,100
research and me telling them about the

569
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,900
dangers that they probably integrated it

570
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,539
in but other companies might not see it

571
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,840
that way imagine if you are let's say a

572
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,179
new country launching your very first

573
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,539
satellite you just want it to work

574
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,940
like it getting up there without blowing

575
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,299
up it's responding when it needs to

576
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,980
um you really don't think about security

577
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,799
when you're at that level so

578
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,179
it's one of those things where security

579
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,580
is more as an afterthought than from the

580
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,460
beginning because when we talk about the

581
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,679
landsat 7 one of the biggest things that

582
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,720
I heard from my fellow classmates were

583
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,200
why would they hack a science experiment

584
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,299
I mean don't they know that that science

585
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,059
is for mankind no one would ever ever

586
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,980
hack my precious satellite that I'm

587
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,080
doing precious science with

588
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,780
what good would it come so you you have

589
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,440
to kind of overcome that mindset of why

590
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,960
would someone do this to they'll

591
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,080
probably do it if they can and you what

592
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,580
you need to do is make it a little bit

593
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,740
difficult for them so they're not just

594
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,780
the average person can do it

595
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,080
I think that's also being attributed to

596
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,659
more cots

597
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,280
secure kind of I don't want to say

598
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,620
modular builds of satellites that are

599
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,080
kind of developing so nowadays instead

600
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,120
of developing your own power source or

601
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,220
your own this and that component you can

602
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,440
buy one off the shelf and hopefully

603
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
those on the Shelf components have a

604
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,379
little bit more Security in them

605
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,679
so what do we do then for existing

606
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,720
satellite infrastructure it's it's much

607
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,520
easier for me to take a satellite and

608
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,960
build it now and build it with security

609
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,940
in mind but what about like GPS

610
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,320
satellites that have been up there for

611
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,059
25 30 years what about some of these

612
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,860
other satellites that are just kind of

613
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,840
Legacy equipment that still has to be

614
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,400
maintained it's still there we still

615
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,179
have to know about it and

616
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,039
I am really am glad you asked that

617
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,740
question I think it it needs to be asked

618
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,919
more often I can tell you that with

619
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,900
modern satellites how they're trying to

620
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
overcome that uh

621
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,760
inevitability that the technology and

622
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,679
the material that you put out into space

623
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,200
is going to be outdated very quickly

624
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,720
especially with the rapid involvement of

625
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,500
chips and components here on Earth is

626
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,539
they're using software to find radios

627
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:06,600
where they can modularly update the the

628
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,980
hardware to you know patching basically

629
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,779
and that has made a huge difference in

630
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,620
our space industry

631
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,640
so a secure encryption key is 256 bits

632
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,039
which like is small enough you could

633
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,260
physically build that into a circuit to

634
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,840
not worry about stuff being

635
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,059
this being over

636
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,860
it so what are the design constraints

637
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,600
for satellites that make the naive

638
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,500
approach

639
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,840
build in your key

640
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,860
attending everything

641
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,840
so you only have trust

642
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,940
ing a ground station going to your C2

643
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,100
what are the design constraints that

644
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,580
don't make that

645
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,120
you did not

646
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,039
solution

647
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,039
I I like how One industry might think

648
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,260
one thing and another industry will

649
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,140
think something else I don't know the

650
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,120
specific answer to your question but I

651
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,220
will give you a scenario that's often

652
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,640
posed to cyber security I guess people

653
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,500
in the when we're drinking after hours

654
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,159
is let's say you have a group on Mars

655
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,440
and they have a medical emergency and

656
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
you really need to talk to them right

657
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
then and there well whenever you design

658
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,440
that packet of communications if you

659
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,419
encrypt it it's already going to take

660
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,279
more than seven minutes to get there

661
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,760
maybe even longer you're adding in a

662
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,500
larger file which is going to increase

663
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,260
the time and you're also adding into the

664
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,260
complexity of that communication Network

665
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,200
so it's more how do you design something

666
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,779
that's encrypted and small and can be

667
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,020
communicated quickly

668
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,120
that whole physics thing it gets in the

669
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,659
way it's horrible I I hate it

670
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,380
sometimes

671
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,960
you know a lot of like Star Lincoln's

672
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,820
other things

673
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,980
are Telecom base

674
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,159
is

675
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,340
hope or perceive that there might be

676
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,620
competitive government guidelines for

677
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,340
these telecom companies for

678
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,059
um

679
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,400
their satellites that they put in space

680
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,799
but there could be concerns about

681
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,600
somebody

682
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,720
going from their consumer Network to the

683
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,940
OT size of that satellite when they're

684
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,840
getting

685
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,940
access

686
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,039
to remain in control of other satellites

687
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,200
but something is being thought about or

688
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,039
well that that is

689
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,600
that is something that's being thought

690
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,700
about I can tell you that one of the

691
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,440
things that I'm looking forward to is is

692
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,960
next year I just got funding we're going

693
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,020
to build a cyber security of satellites

694
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,419
Lab at Savannah River National Lab and

695
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:10,740
we're going to integrate a Hardware in

696
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,779
the loop satellite design so that we can

697
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,539
look at some of those issues

698
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:17,039
I think it's particularly important that

699
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,899
those issues are looked at especially

700
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,880
with the the new policy move for

701
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
government instead of launching their

702
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,880
own individual satellites they're

703
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,700
thinking of more taking on payloads of

704
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,500
other satellites or other commercial

705
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,620
entities and you always wonder if you're

706
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,179
plugging in this payload and you don't

707
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,919
know what it is and you're plugging it

708
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,779
into your Hardware is not going to

709
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,980
interfere with something on your

710
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,380
Hardware how do you create the the

711
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,720
diodes that you need to make sure that

712
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,360
information isn't spread to places that

713
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,279
it shouldn't be

714
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,919
um it's a major concern right now

715
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,140
um if you have an answer or a solution I

716
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,640
would love to talk to you afterwards

717
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
that's it for this talk
