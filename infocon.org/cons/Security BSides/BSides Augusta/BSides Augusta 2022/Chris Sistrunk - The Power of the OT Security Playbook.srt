1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,500
all right thanks so much uh test test I

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,370
think you can hear me okay awesome

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,740
[Applause]

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,800
so uh we've had great weather uh we used

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,380
to be expecting a hurricane so we got to

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,539
think about that but how many people

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,039
here have

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,039
OT or work with OT or have it in

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,380
somewhere and where you work okay a

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,140
pretty good many of you okay hopefully

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,059
this talk will resonate with you and if

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,980
you're an I.T

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,140
um background you can kind of hopefully

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,300
get this message across to the folks

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,620
that do

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,280
OT where you work or your colleagues

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,460
and that's kind of the uh and since it's

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,620
football season right A lot of people

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,199
love football I kind of want to tie

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
those two subjects together so my name

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,420
is Chris sistrunk I'm a technical

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,820
manager at mandiant for the last almost

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,060
nine years I'm on the ICS OT Consulting

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,299
team and done assessments and critical

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,880
infrastructure around the world but

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,560
before that I was a power engineer for

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,260
Entergy over in uh

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,659
and Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and

29
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,460
Texas that's where that company's based

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,540
out of they've probably sent all their

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,659
linemen over here and towards Florida

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,320
and the East Coast there but I was in

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,560
scada and substation automation also was

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,659
the founder and I ran besides Jackson in

35
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,680
Mississippi for about six years and it's

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
still continuing on hope not

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,159
unfortunately not this year hopefully

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,900
next year they'll start besides Jackson

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,140
back up and beer eye sack napcon dad

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,960
joke says a service so

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,619
and then now Mandy and we're kind of

42
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,420
becoming Google so I'll probably get one

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,119
of these hats here in the next month

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,560
um

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
so I want to start off with some wisdom

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,040
I like sharing

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,100
um good nuggets that kind of help tie

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,220
the idea together so Mike Tyson anybody

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,060
a fan of Sports boxing he has a really

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,400
great quote about having a plan everyone

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,500
has a plan until they get punched in the

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,080
mouth

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,300
and then you know throw your plans out

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,120
well the the the guy that interviewed

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,720
him Mike Bernardino or berardino

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,739
um

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,500
was got his quote and he asked them for

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,540
some context around that and his

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,819
response to that was it's how you react

60
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,459
to that adversity that defines you not

61
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,620
the adversity itself

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,480
so that's something really to think

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
about as we're doing for those of us who

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,800
are in instant response cyber security

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
infosec any of these things even

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,780
Engineers we're trying to defend what we

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,019
have and make them better and that's

68
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,000
kind of that adversity is what we're

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,280
going to be responding to

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,000
the last quote is from

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,459
my senior safety guy when I started the

72
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,459
power company he had a quote that he

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,860
told everyone even the linemen safety

74
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,780
rules are Written in Blood

75
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,060
and so think about that something bad

76
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,940
happens we've got to write that as a

77
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,140
safety rule

78
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,120
so it's the same thing with cyber

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
security if you do something bad that's

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,099
going to be a check or a mitigation that

81
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,640
we're going to implement

82
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,720
so response plans and playbooks aren't

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,239
aren't new right sports teams have been

84
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,819
using playbooks to win games with great

85
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,140
success

86
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,260
you know government entities have been

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,360
using structured instant response like

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,099
FEMA started in the 1970s from wildfires

89
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,220
you know deal responding to that there's

90
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,959
a

91
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,659
part under FEMA called Nims National

92
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,640
Incident Management System that's a

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,580
little screenshot there of that so

94
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,920
anytime there's a disaster of any kind

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,260
now just about the government

96
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,500
spins up FEMA spins up Nims

97
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,239
and there's a whole bunch of different

98
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,358
parts under Nims now National Incident

99
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,478
Management System

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,419
the CDC used it in responding to Coba

101
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,820
19.

102
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,300
we also have playbooks

103
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,960
for Disaster Recovery

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,580
incident response playbooks are already

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,759
invaluable tool to win or not prevent

106
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,600
them or minimize an impact but in the

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,540
case of a cyber security incident or Foe

108
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,820
here industrial processes like this one

109
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,180
from

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,100
um but a BP you know they had the big

111
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,280
rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico

112
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,759
I believe was it 2012 that was the uh

113
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,699
yeah the deep water Horizon right that

114
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,060
was really something that they had to

115
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,300
write playbooks around and that's a an

116
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,520
example from one of their instant

117
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
response playbooks and then of course we

118
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,620
have the the the nist standards for

119
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,320
instant response right

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,740
so basically we want to say is they're

121
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,460
not new how can we apply them to

122
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,440
OT environments with cyber security in

123
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,560
mind

124
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,080
so there's an incident there should be a

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,300
plan right not just someone going help

126
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,600
help

127
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,720
so we have these instant response plans

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,500
and playbooks like nist SBA 161 standard

129
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,259
right and this is a standards that

130
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,500
they've been publishing around that

131
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,120
vulnerability response playbooks

132
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,000
there's also this incident command

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,220
system structure from FEMA that I talked

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,160
about which is in use right now

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,699
uh after a hurricane in

136
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,860
and this is kind of I want to dedicate

137
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,720
dedicate this talk to all of the

138
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,820
incident responders

139
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,680
this is a screenshot from just a few

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
days ago in Tallahassee

141
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,460
of just one Cadre of line trucks

142
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,380
uh lineman

143
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,660
and think about it there I think I read

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,900
on Twitter some say there's over 30 000

145
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,440
line Crews incident responders going to

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
help restore the power after the the

147
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,520
hurricane hit but also you have you see

148
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,020
all the the buses there you have

149
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,400
Logistics

150
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,979
you have porta-potties they're all lined

151
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,080
up on on the bottom left there

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,860
you have the feed and house all these

153
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,440
people you have your your First

154
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,900
Responders like your medical and

155
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,380
ambulances you have tree trimmers

156
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,039
you have cable TV and internet service

157
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,680
providers going to restore so all of

158
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,440
that stuff follows this incident command

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
structure

160
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,479
um that is really something to behold I

161
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,280
got to experience this when I worked at

162
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,699
Entergy doing hurricane instant response

163
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,479
we had a tabletop Playbook that was

164
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,520
about this thick you know four inch

165
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,060
three ring binder that would take two to

166
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,580
three hundred people to practice during

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,280
a whole week we would have fake storms

168
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,039
coming from The Weather Channel or

169
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,800
whatever they would email us the updates

170
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,660
and then we would practice it all the

171
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,220
way down to which power lines were going

172
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,340
out what was our triage how do we get

173
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,819
the quickest power on the fastest and

174
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,919
get the most people's lives back on

175
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,720
so I really want to dedicate this talk

176
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,419
and this idea uh to what's going on now

177
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,840
here's an uh a screenshot from last

178
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,780
night at the beginning Florida when they

179
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,220
were hit they had over two and a half

180
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,639
million out last night they were down a

181
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,199
million they had got a million lights

182
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,340
back on

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,639
but Puerto Rico that whole island was

184
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,740
out they've got half of about half the

185
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,280
island back on and now we see North

186
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,240
Carolina

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,819
and South Carolina and Virginia affected

188
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,280
as well so this is from the website

189
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,560
poweroutage.us

190
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,780
and it collects all the outage data from

191
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,280
all the power companies and you can

192
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,020
actually go watch it on Twitter as well

193
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,399
if you keep up with Twitter

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,940
uh earlier last two years ago I'm sorry

195
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,700
two years ago we had this talk at a

196
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,860
cyber security conference called S4 it's

197
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,480
in Miami every

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,700
um spring or a late winter it's in

199
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,700
February generally and that this idea of

200
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,339
taking this incident command system ICS

201
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,080
and then applying it for instant

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,140
response for control system environments

203
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,440
which is a great idea and so we we

204
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
created this group I don't say me it was

205
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,040
led by Megan Samford and she grabbed all

206
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,320
of her incident command background got

207
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,560
all of her folks involved got the ISA

208
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,360
which is international Society of

209
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,300
automation involved we got Global people

210
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,920
involved there's over a thousand people

211
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,260
involved in this now and you can

212
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,140
actually become credentialed and be an

213
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,300
Incident Commander you can go take the

214
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,760
trainings online and become

215
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,680
as part of the FEMA process you can be

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,200
credentialed in this now which is really

217
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,500
great uh organization change so well the

218
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,720
idea of that was is using an existing

219
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,260
system and then adding cyber uh instant

220
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,920
response to that so back to

221
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,959
uh Playbook idea right this is some

222
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,260
playbooks from

223
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,420
usafootball.com and it talks about

224
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,140
playbooks that if you want to have for

225
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,760
your team like if you're a high school

226
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,740
coach or something like that

227
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,860
basically you have to know your role and

228
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,220
what you are playing as a team if you're

229
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,019
on offense you've got to know your role

230
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,000
in what plays that you can do

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,360
to take advantage of the opponent

232
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,040
in defense you have the same thing

233
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,500
you've got to know which plays that

234
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,360
you're going to play when you see the

235
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,459
offense have a vulnerability and we can

236
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,100
take advantage of that right so we think

237
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,980
about it in that way

238
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,779
as the sports teams do we do that in

239
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,779
cyber security instant response

240
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,079
so part of that knowing your role for

241
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,120
Control Systems let's say this is The

242
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,820
Incident Commander this is from Nims

243
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,980
you have your like I said before you

244
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,160
have your different planning Logistics

245
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,500
Finance who's going to pay for all this

246
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,180
incident response who's going to pay for

247
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,940
all these hotels

248
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,519
same with OT

249
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,980
who do we call and when when an incident

250
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,620
happens do you call mandiant well great

251
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,100
if you don't that's fine call somebody

252
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,720
um but you're also going to have to deal

253
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,480
with folks instead of just normal I.T

254
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,420
Security in your sock team there since

255
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,000
it's an incident perhaps involving

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,760
control system and physical environments

257
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,380
you're going to have to call the subject

258
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,060
matter experts that are like Engineers

259
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,339
operators

260
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,940
the safety department because if there's

261
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,279
like for instance if you had malware

262
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,220
infecting a

263
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,019
aluminum

264
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,820
smelting line or aluminum pot line where

265
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,279
they're producing ingots of molten

266
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,540
aluminum

267
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,700
you have to act fast you don't want that

268
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
aluminum to to freeze otherwise you're

269
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,320
going to have to throw out your entire

270
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,959
operation

271
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,640
so you have to act quickly think about

272
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,360
safety and also one thing I do want to

273
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,700
highlight here in addition to your other

274
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,600
things like legal hrpr you also want to

275
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,940
talk to your vendors because

276
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,019
a lot of times in control systems

277
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,820
the control system equipment is very

278
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,040
specialized it's not windows it's not

279
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
Linux it's going to be some real-time

280
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,800
operating system that's maybe custom and

281
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,100
so you have to use their expertise

282
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,980
and call them and have them help you

283
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,800
like from Siemens GE ABB whoever it may

284
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,640
be even health care we can even consider

285
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,380
Health Care kind of like

286
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,800
uh related to OT in some cases so we've

287
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,200
got hospitals all around us right so

288
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,760
you're gonna have to call the GE folks

289
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
when you have something

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
dealing with maybe malware that's

291
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,839
impacting these Health Care Systems

292
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,220
so I want to review a talk that a I did

293
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,399
several years ago at Defcon and a few

294
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,380
other places

295
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,360
and that talk was called what's the

296
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,260
difference between I uh for for what's

297
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,700
the difference for

298
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,540
OT and that's a dad joke uh so

299
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,220
if you like Dad jokes follow me on

300
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,000
Twitter

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,700
uh so we have the seven steps of instant

302
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,360
response so the first step uh at least

303
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,399
from Mandy's point of view is assess the

304
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,880
situation triage where how is this

305
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,339
affected it's similar to when you have

306
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,959
an I.T incident you're going to have to

307
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,700
do the same triage it's going to be the

308
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,220
same as a hurricane response what's

309
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,760
damaged what's effective what's not who

310
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,920
do we have available to help us respond

311
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,920
to that that's going to be similar

312
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,579
the next defined objectives is going to

313
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,560
be what's a little bit different we've

314
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,380
got to return the control system or the

315
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,540
manufacturing plan or the hospital back

316
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,740
to normal

317
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,660
as quickly and safely as possible

318
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,540
sometimes safety is the key driver there

319
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,380
not confidentiality

320
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,820
you're going to have to get things back

321
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,399
safe where people are okay and the

322
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
equipment is okay so just remember there

323
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,880
may be physical processes involved

324
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,339
the next step is collect evidence so you

325
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,380
got to collect your evidence to do the

326
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,380
proper scoping and get the indicators of

327
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,040
compromise as you're going through that

328
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,380
remember that control system devices and

329
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,000
embedded devices have real-time

330
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
operating systems and you know protocols

331
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,820
that are not you that are not used in

332
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,339
I.T so you have things like modbus

333
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,019
and dmp3 and other protocols profinet

334
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,120
that the it tools that you're used to

335
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,639
when you do instant response those tools

336
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,100
don't understand those protocols and so

337
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,480
you may have to collect these things

338
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,680
manually

339
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,560
unless you have one of the recent

340
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,060
companies there's several companies out

341
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,260
there that do network security

342
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,260
monitoring for ICS

343
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,240
so you can leverage that if you have

344
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,100
that

345
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,560
now the next step is performing analysis

346
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
on that collected data

347
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,079
and to verify anomalies or finding evil

348
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,660
like we say at mandian and there's no

349
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,480
ICS specific dfir tools out there you're

350
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
going to have to use

351
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,980
the tools that maybe the vendor has so

352
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,260
one like when when we did the instant

353
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,920
response for the Triton malware in 2017

354
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,560
it targeted the safety instrumented

355
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,139
systems that were from Schneider

356
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,540
Electric that's one of the vendors we

357
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,519
had to partner with them

358
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,399
to use their lab and their tools and

359
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,459
their memory analysis with their

360
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,959
software developers and their Hardware

361
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,940
developers to to understand what was

362
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
going on

363
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,920
that was really important to have as a

364
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,480
partner

365
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,959
communicating what's happening that that

366
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,360
constant uh

367
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,760
call that conference call every day or

368
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,139
the Roll-Ups that's going to happen

369
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,560
every day twice a day

370
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,940
it's going to be similar to where you do

371
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,260
regular instant response and then lastly

372
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,019
developing the remediation plan when to

373
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,940
kick the bad guys out and regain control

374
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,820
remember control system devices may have

375
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,459
constraints like hard-coded backdoor

376
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,500
passwords you can't change and you can't

377
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,199
just re-image like a PLC like you can a

378
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,439
laptop

379
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,199
the lastly the uh after action report is

380
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,519
going to be the same thing you just got

381
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
to document that the same way so this IR

382
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,100
plan objective

383
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,399
they're made be no right way to do it it

384
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
may be dependent upon your control

385
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,000
system how it's designed how it's

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,339
engineered

387
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:59,279
and the safety may be number one the

388
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,500
incident response plan and play books

389
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,779
are going to be different probably for

390
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,160
each type of network you have

391
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
so since we're talking about coaches and

392
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,059
playbooks this is a screenshot of coach

393
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,500
Sean Payne who used to be the coach of

394
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,260
the Saints my favorite team

395
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,619
and you can see it he's got quite a bit

396
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,480
there on his Playbook there you can see

397
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
you know third and long third and short

398
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,059
on offense when to pass when to you know

399
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,160
what the defense looks like they're

400
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,780
going to each of these plays are

401
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,640
designed for

402
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,740
particular part of the game and using

403
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,380
the strengths of his players and taking

404
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,000
advantage of the opponent's weaknesses

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,059
so that's the whole idea about having

406
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,940
these playbooks for OT

407
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,460
so we break down the incident response

408
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,700
plan into use cases or playbooks or run

409
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,660
books

410
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,520
and hopefully you're all familiar with

411
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,559
those and now we want to do the same

412
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,620
thing for OT

413
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,600
that whole step-by-step instructions

414
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,679
that maybe the IR teams used to but also

415
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,380
the engineers they may not be familiar

416
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,600
with some of these things so or they may

417
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,059
be they may know more than the I.T

418
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,679
security folks so they have to work

419
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,200
together to write these playbooks down

420
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,640
and and have that custom tailored

421
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,340
instant response playbook for what's

422
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,820
happening

423
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,520
some example use cases that I highly

424
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,780
recommend that the control system half

425
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,480
is these four commodity malware what do

426
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,400
you do if commodity malware's in your OT

427
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,340
environment

428
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,720
often it's just finding where it's

429
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,360
coming from and cleaning it with some

430
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,100
kind of malware cleaner because a lot of

431
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,740
times

432
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,940
these Control Systems may not even have

433
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,500
antivirus so you're gonna have to deal

434
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,820
with that

435
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,740
the second one is this credential

436
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,200
compromise what if your OT credentials

437
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,520
are compromised like the operator

438
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,440
credentials that's what happened in the

439
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,900
first Ukraine attack in 2015 the

440
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,520
attacker stole all their operator

441
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,200
credentials

442
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,020
and you have to be able to to know what

443
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,480
to do if that happens and sometimes you

444
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,039
can't change the password sometimes

445
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,500
there's hard-coded backdoor passwords so

446
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,360
you have to have other mitigations in

447
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,919
place

448
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,679
another one is if there's some kind of

449
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,120
destructive attack

450
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,520
like kill disc

451
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,880
you know not payche uh want to cry any

452
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
type of ransomware we've been seeing a

453
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,020
lot more of that impacting control

454
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,840
systems in the last several years and so

455
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,020
you have to have a a plan to you know

456
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,440
emergency segment that Network or have

457
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,840
restore from backups is a critical

458
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,160
response

459
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,860
the last one is the ICS protocol attack

460
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,460
if someone's using ICS protocols to do

461
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,100
bad things to your control system what

462
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,260
do you do in that case

463
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,080
so we have like stuxnet drink and

464
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,620
Destroyer one Triton and Destroyer 2

465
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,020
which was discovered this year in

466
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,940
advance

467
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,880
actually Ukraine cert caught industry or

468
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,380
two before it was dropped

469
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,140
and then this also one from this year's

470
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,000
ink controller that we wrote a blog post

471
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
about and I believe several others wrote

472
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,340
blog posts about I think dragos called

473
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,440
it something else they called it pipe

474
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,480
dream

475
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,860
there's a lot of good things that we

476
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,200
caught it wasn't ever found in a victims

477
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,620
network but another use case of a

478
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,360
control system protocol is being used

479
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,919
for evil

480
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,039
so having these redeem remediations for

481
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,860
each play restoring backups resetting

482
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,380
passwords sever or isolating the OT

483
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,140
network with the emergency red button

484
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,220
script to to segment the network

485
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,679
utilizing critical spares that's really

486
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,100
important

487
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
review the tape

488
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,059
so like we said tabletops like with the

489
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,840
power companies we practice that

490
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,760
emergency plan for Hurricane response

491
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,020
every year

492
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,280
so God will take those exercises and do

493
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,320
them in your OT environments

494
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,140
because often they may not have one very

495
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,539
often and may not have an incident they

496
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,220
may have an honest mistake more often

497
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,460
than a malware incident

498
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,500
so take those Lessons Learned take the

499
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,419
Past

500
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,880
aars after action reports doing threat

501
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,760
modeling reviewing what real world

502
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,760
events have been happening

503
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,880
to drive your preparation for the next

504
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
thing right

505
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,880
here's an example of a free Playbook

506
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
that's out there from Power industry so

507
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
APPA I'll post these slides so you can

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,039
get the link later if you can't take a

509
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,799
picture of it now but Public Power has

510
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,559
this really great Playbook about how to

511
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,480
do instant response

512
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,179
for like the mom and pop electric

513
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,580
company that's out there that's not like

514
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,440
part of the big one like here would be

515
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,919
Georgia power and others they already

516
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,140
have playbooks but the one the smaller

517
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
power companies they don't and so this

518
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,220
is why they wrote this one

519
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,500
good free resource so

520
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,240
all right stop

521
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
gotta collaborate with your ICS vendors

522
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,100
like I mentioned before they have those

523
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,720
steps documented that you could probably

524
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,419
use in your response playbooks they may

525
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,740
have it in their manuals they may not

526
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,720
you may have to work on them together

527
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,240
with your vendors but we really highly

528
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,400
recommend you work with your customized

529
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,520
equipment vendors

530
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,700
to design your response to if something

531
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,159
bad happens

532
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:57,780
and if there's an incident more likely

533
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,700
they're going to have to be involved

534
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,919
because your engineers and operators

535
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,320
won't have time to learn what that

536
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,820
system does under the hood

537
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,860
we don't want to over complicate things

538
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm getting close to the end of my talk

539
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,700
here

540
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,559
so more wisdom from football the best

541
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
defense against any offense is your

542
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,840
defensive playbook no one else's do what

543
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,640
you do best this is from

544
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,559
joedanielfootball.com

545
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,919
it's really great quote do what you do

546
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,179
best

547
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,240
have that good defensive playbook you

548
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,280
don't need every coverage every coverage

549
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,720
has a weakness

550
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,000
so choose complementary coverage that

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,039
takes away that weakness

552
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,000
so have a set of five playbooks that

553
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,760
cover most of your things I had four

554
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,039
there listen if you have two of those

555
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,960
that's even great

556
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,580
a complicated Playbook won't win

557
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,440
football games for you if the players

558
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,240
can't execute you should strive to keep

559
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,679
your playbook as simple as you can

560
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,380
now run the Playbook you've got those

561
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,419
designed for each phase you got your

562
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,480
player strengths and exploiting your

563
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,400
attacker's weaknesses remember that what

564
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,080
you practiced and react to that

565
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,320
adversity so anybody recognize these

566
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,299
players here there's quite a difference

567
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,980
in size you know David and Goliath right

568
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,559
yeah that's it's really something is

569
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,820
sometimes the smaller Defenders can

570
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,240
win against what would be a scary vote

571
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,539
right

572
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,299
knowledge in preparation are powerful

573
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,039
so I'm not going to read everything here

574
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,500
just the three main points create an OT

575
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,240
incident response plan if you don't

576
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,620
already

577
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,500
Define use cases for each of your

578
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,260
different scenarios like I said like

579
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,260
those four have commodity malware

580
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,000
playbook for OT

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,280
what if your passwords are stolen or

582
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,360
compromised and destructive malware in

583
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
your OT environment those three is

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,679
really important to have one about the

585
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,659
ICS security protocol I mean ICS

586
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,140
protocol one is a good one to have

587
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,659
and then practice

588
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,760
we want you to redefine the wind so

589
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,799
since I'm kind of close to Atlanta I've

590
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,240
got a dog on the Falcons a little bit

591
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,520
with this play here uh minimize the

592
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,640
impact by preparing early detection and

593
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,860
response so this is the lineman from the

594
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,779
Saints he was able to catch that

595
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,419
football and return it to almost a

596
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,980
touchdown in that that particular

597
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,640
instance and he just wipes out uh Matt

598
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,299
their their quarterback right

599
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:47,520
that was due to his preparation

600
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,559
halting the attacker somewhere in the

601
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,779
cycle stops them from achieving their

602
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,299
objective and transparency in

603
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,279
information sharing within your own

604
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,299
company will help targeted orgs and even

605
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,919
other Prudential victims within your own

606
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,200
company and with others that you are

607
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,880
partners with

608
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,039
with that do I have any questions

609
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,240
and oh yes

610
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,419
yeah it's it's important with hurricane

611
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,299
response it's a regular practice in the

612
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,240
South right and that's why our Playbook

613
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,120
was so thick because we had so many

614
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,799
injects and variables that we could

615
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,000
throw at what we've seen

616
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,360
same with instant response of any type

617
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,820
on your cyber security insulin response

618
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,520
plans it's good to have a practice

619
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,159
across teams every year you had a

620
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,760
question yes

621
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,600
so the the best tool is having

622
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,279
people

623
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,400
to even start using what you have but if

624
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,900
you give them a tool that has that

625
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,600
knowledge I mean even Wireshark

626
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,039
understands 30 different control systems

627
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,480
and protocols uh and bro now Zeke has a

628
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,220
whole bunch of different parsers for

629
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,500
control system stuff so even if you

630
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,779
don't have those tools that cost a lot

631
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,320
of money right and there's a lot of

632
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,840
Market competition out there

633
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,000
um you can start somewhere with free

634
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
tools but if you do get one they're all

635
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,520
have strengths I would suggest that you

636
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,320
look at differ the different tools and

637
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,700
do a Bake Off

638
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,159
and for your environment this particular

639
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,260
tool like a nozomi Clarity dragos

640
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,080
whatever cyberx which is now Microsoft

641
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,360
Defender for iot they all may have

642
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,340
different strengths for what your

643
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,200
network is like

644
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,419
so I would I would test them and Hammer

645
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,539
them

646
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,559
um before I answer any more questions

647
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll do some trivia

648
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,740
so anybody uh

649
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,440
this is a practical iot hacking so can

650
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,220
someone name a one of the uh recent

651
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,520
control system malwares

652
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,279
in Destroyer okay

653
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,020
who was that

654
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,100
yeah all right

655
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,659
I'll just leave this here

656
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,779
all right uh second one

657
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,679
does anybody know which protocol

658
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,620
industry are you used there and I'll say

659
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,080
industry or two the one that was revised

660
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,860
this year

661
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,840
does anybody know what a protocol

662
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,039
control system protocol

663
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,820
modbus no

664
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,020
no not close uh so this is I'll give you

665
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,120
a hand it's European Standard protocols

666
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,340
they're not what's used in U.S even

667
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,960
though modbus is used everywhere any

668
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,860
other guesses

669
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,140
that's the winner all right you get that

670
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
uh this little uh

671
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,880
Alpha network wireless adapter there so

672
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,200
any other questions before time

673
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,240
okay one question here

674
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,039
okay so how I transitioned is uh stuxnet

675
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,760
um I I was doing some cyber security uh

676
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,419
back in 2008 because of nerkship

677
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,460
regulations

678
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,039
but then when the news about stuxnet

679
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,059
came in 2010 it was

680
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,260
simultaneously scary

681
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,539
and sexy at the same time

682
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,039
and so

683
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,980
I was like oh this is terrible wow this

684
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,080
is really cool you know kind of deal and

685
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,600
so that really sucked my brain and then

686
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,840
I got sucked backwards into doing some

687
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,580
research on my own I was on the dmp3

688
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,559
technical committee someone one of my

689
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,899
friends wrote a fuzzer for it and we

690
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,240
tested it out and I told him immediately

691
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,340
to take all of his fuzzer tools off of

692
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,500
GitHub immediately because we broke like

693
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,659
30 different things

694
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,360
and then I got an offer to come work at

695
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,539
mandian so I actually wrote I gave a

696
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,419
talk back at besides 2015 of how to get

697
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,860
into ICS security so if you're

698
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,200
interested in how to do that even though

699
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,640
some of the links are probably outdated

700
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,980
