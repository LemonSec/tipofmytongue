1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,540
Augusta are you ready to rock

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,480
all right you wanted the best they got

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
stuck in Florida so you got me so

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,180
uh so hopefully you're in the right

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,220
place by saboteurs and Scoundrels again

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,900
my name is Brian contest a little

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,820
background I've been in cyber security

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,840
way too long about 25 years I've been

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,820
building companies most of my career I

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,380
started with disa and then later Bell

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,940
Labs I lived in Brazil for a couple

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,800
years but then just started building

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,860
startups rip Tech Arc site imperva solar

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,559
networks verden a couple IPOs couple

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,620
Acquisitions I wrote a couple books my

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,879
last book was with the director of the

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,160
NSA and then I recently did a

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,199
documentary for HBO and cyber warfare

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,120
with General Michael Hayden so I've been

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,559
doing this for a little while so I've

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,420
learned a lot of ways of not to do

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,879
things certainly lots of great Lessons

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
Learned but this presentation is really

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,380
about X iot

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,979
or what we sometimes call extended iot

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,500
now X iot is really three General

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,260
categories the first one I think most of

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,520
you are familiar with it's Enterprise

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
iot or Enterprise Internet of Things

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,640
printers KVM switches lights out

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,280
management

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,119
HVAC systems security cameras

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,659
UPS racks things of this nature

34
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,520
the other portion are OT and there's

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,500
been a couple talks in OT today but

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,540
scada devices industrial control systems

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,600
plcs that genre things that are digital

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,460
equipment that controls physics so

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,079
temperature flow mixtures volume things

40
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,140
of this nature the third one are network

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,740
devices these are specific to switches

42
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,340
and routers network attached storage

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,200
load balancers wireless access points

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
and so on so collectively these groups

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,640
have a few things in common the first

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,660
one is their purpose-built hardware and

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,000
firmware so they might be just as

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,860
powerful as a laptop or in some cases

49
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,260
even more powerful but they have a very

50
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,420
finite use case

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,920
the other portion is they're Network

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,140
connected there's some OT devices that

53
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,520
are actually not Network connected and

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,140
there's some iots that actually aren't

55
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,239
as well but in this conversation we're

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,200
talking about things that are network

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,599
connected it's usually TCP but it could

58
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,900
be modbus dnp3 other Pro other protocols

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,620
Etc

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,480
and the last thing is and probably most

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,980
important for today's conversation is

62
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,300
you can't put any kind of endpoint

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,040
Security on these devices

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,860
so while they're running Linux or

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,680
Android or BSD or VX works or other

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,540
relatively common operating systems or

67
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
real-time operating systems and they

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,640
have all the same power and storage and

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,500
capabilities and ports and protocols as

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,599
those systems you can't put any Security

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,000
on them there's no anti-malware there's

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
no host based IDs or IPS most of them

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
don't have runtime protection

74
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,599
they're just there and they're just

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,640
vulnerable so that's kind of a perfect

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,280
storm for attackers hence this whole

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,379
presentation so I think most of you are

78
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,000
probably familiar with Showdown

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
if you're not it's just like doing a

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Google search to show me what kind of

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,180
devices are internet accessible within

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,159
certain categories so I did a very

83
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,019
scientific study and I typed in words

84
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,159
like camera UPS voice over IP just to

85
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,560
see what might come up in these but look

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,140
at cameras there's almost five million

87
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,239
cameras and there's probably a

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,680
percentage of these that are honey pots

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,019
but even if it's five percent which is

90
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,360
probably less than that but look at

91
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,420
UPS's uninterrupted power supplies what

92
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,580
would be the use case of having your UPS

93
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,099
internet accessible probably not

94
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,980
something that was done on purpose a

95
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,019
quick question

96
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,239
sure the audience here what do you think

97
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,459
is the most common UPS vendor out there

98
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,659
I'm sure you've heard the name before

99
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,620
but

100
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,299
APC

101
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,000
so I did some more scientific research I

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,099
said I wonder how hard it would be to

103
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,739
find out what the default username and

104
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,379
password is to a

105
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,738
APC UPS does anybody want a hazard to

106
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,000
guess what the default username and

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
password is

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,100
not even that hard

109
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,780
so using this hacker tool called Google

110
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,800
I said default password APC UPS and it's

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,560
APC APC in lowercase

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,680
now just to give you some feedback so my

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,660
company phosphorus we focus on X iot

114
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,400
stuff we've been doing this for years

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,139
and years

116
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,960
we have a bet and that's we if we ever

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,380
find an APC UPS system that does not

118
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,440
have the default password APC with the

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,139
default username APC will buy everybody

120
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,940
in the office a steak dinner

121
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,280
we've been eating a lot of chicken

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,199
nobody ever changes these so you've got

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,139
about 13 000 plus devices that are

124
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,060
internet accessible which are probably

125
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,680
pretty important and they probably have

126
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,780
important things plugged into them and

127
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,540
there's about a 99.99 chance the

128
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,840
username and passwords APC APC so use

129
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,759
that however you like

130
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,280
uh so here are some stories about these

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,560
devices has anybody heard of a Russian X

132
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,380
iot hacking 2 called fronten

133
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,660
okay this is kind of a unique tool so

134
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,060
the Russian FSB

135
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,060
had a Consulting Group build an X iot

136
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,639
hacking tool for them specifically to do

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,940
the following find xiot devices like we

138
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,340
just did with Showdown compromise those

139
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,479
devices

140
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,180
control those devices use those devices

141
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,759
then to attack it Assets in those

142
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,680
environments and then exfiltrate

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,080
sensitive data It's actually an

144
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,120
extremely extremely powerful tool

145
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
unfortunately for the Russian FSB it got

146
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,680
stolen by the digital Revolution hacking

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
group that said this is way too powerful

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,940
for one nation to have so if you go to

149
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,740
your favorite Torrance and other

150
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,940
locations where you like to download

151
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,820
malware and hacking tools and if you can

152
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,520
read Russian this is a really really

153
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,259
powerful tool that you can leverage

154
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,000
today and by the way it's not just

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Russia that builds tools like this

156
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,539
everyone's building tools like this now

157
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,180
because hacking X iot is the the new new

158
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,060
and we'll talk about why that is

159
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,919
China takes a little bit of a different

160
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,780
approach to this China says well that

161
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,160
seems like a lot of work to hack

162
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,199
something after the fact why don't we

163
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,580
just ship it with the malware already

164
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,500
installed we'll just skip the middleman

165
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,539
it's a huge Time Saver it's very

166
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,220
efficient It's very effective

167
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,020
so the U.S House of Representatives

168
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,479
actually passed a bill Banning certain

169
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,620
vendors things like ZTE Huawei

170
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,520
hickvision which is one of my favorite

171
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,800
that's a camera up there it actually

172
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,680
ships with the malware already installed

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,620
um it's it's pretty interesting how

174
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,199
blatant is as well so essentially when

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,000
the camera is recording audio and video

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,639
there's a light that's green

177
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,280
and if you say hey camera stop recording

178
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,319
audio and video it says okay I'm going

179
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,300
to turn that green light to red but

180
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,460
guess what it's still recording audio

181
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,740
and video and it's still streaming that

182
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,660
information back to a location that

183
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,220
eventually makes its way back to China

184
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,080
where they're doing temporal analysis

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,180
volumetric analysis pattern Discovery

186
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,400
anomaly detection to correlate massive

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,380
amounts of data so you can think of some

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,819
of these cameras are probably in very

189
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,380
sensitive areas Financial Services

190
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,240
critical infrastructure boardrooms

191
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,940
things like this so that's the hick

192
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,160
Vision it's not to slam this particular

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,660
company I'm sure they have some products

194
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,160
that are very good that aren't Laden

195
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,560
with malware but they happen to be so

196
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,120
high profile that they are banned by the

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,860
US in government use and with government

198
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,020
contractors yet we see them all the time

199
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,039
and fun fact the most common camera on

200
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,039
Amazon the last few years with the

201
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,840
highest number of reviews came

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,180
pre-loaded with malware as well so this

203
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,699
is a very common occurrence for security

204
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,099
cameras now this Hikvision camera

205
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,599
something else this happened very

206
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,419
recently so August 23rd this year

207
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,759
it was announced that there was over 80

208
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,880
000 exploitable Hikvision cameras and

209
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,099
that number actually I think is way

210
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,620
lower probably by an order of magnitude

211
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,020
but a patch came out for this exploit

212
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,900
back in September 2021 it doesn't

213
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,400
surprise me that it wasn't applied

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,620
though because nobody ever patches these

215
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,960
devices when these devices get deployed

216
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,819
they're pretty much the same way as day

217
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,060
one as they are you know year 20 when

218
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,139
they get ripped out of the office

219
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,200
building so no one's fixing these so

220
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,299
it's kind of a sad State of Affair for

221
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,440
hickvision

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,440
that they ship with malware and if

223
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,179
that's not good enough for you here's a

224
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,799
bunch of exploits you can use against it

225
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,740
as well it's not very fair but I guess

226
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,300
life's not fair

227
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,800
it's not fair that carbs make you fat

228
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,660
but I'm Italian I love pasta and there

229
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,899
you go

230
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,580
so who's heard of Mirai the Mariah

231
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,860
botnet quite a few of you this is like

232
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860
the poster child for xiot attacks this

233
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,740
is way back in 2016 which in the xiot

234
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,080
world is ancient history but this is

235
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,540
pretty interesting so the attackers

236
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,279
started off by searching for cameras

237
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,980
just like we did with Showdown further

238
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,540
they refine the search to say hey is

239
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,180
tone net running so Port 23. okay I

240
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,220
found a camera it's got telnet open

241
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,800
third thing does it have the default

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
password well most of them do and if it

243
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,540
doesn't let's try one of about eight or

244
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,820
ten different password combinations and

245
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,459
sure enough that gave this botnet enough

246
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,640
power to take down Sony Reddit Netflix

247
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,220
Twitter PayPal GitHub major telecoms

248
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,560
there's just a few security cameras

249
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,440
had more aggregate processing power and

250
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
bandwidth than Google and Amazon

251
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,700
combined so it just goes to show you how

252
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,279
powerful some of these botnets are but

253
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,600
the plot thickens

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,640
in the xiot world there's a lot of

255
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,500
shared libraries and there's a lot of

256
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,200
white labeling which means I have a

257
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,300
security camera and it's got this build

258
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,459
but hey this guy over here is building a

259
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,500
printer and he doesn't want to use all

260
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
his original code so he's going to grab

261
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,740
the shared Library this bit of white

262
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,959
labeling this and that so now this

263
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,160
printer has the exact same

264
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,800
vulnerabilities it's running telnet it's

265
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,959
running default passwords as the camera

266
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,180
and so is this AV Equipment and so is

267
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,399
this Voiceover IP phone so now you're

268
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,200
seeing that this spreads to multiple X

269
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,480
iot devices and this is indicative of

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,700
this space all the time because a lot of

271
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,019
these companies aren't tech companies

272
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,700
that build this equipment some of them

273
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,680
are some of them aren't HP they build

274
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,600
printers they're a technical technical

275
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,880
company there's agricultural companies

276
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,140
there's companies that focus on

277
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,880
Healthcare and other things this isn't

278
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
their daytime job so they bring in

279
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,600
contractors Consultants that don't have

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
any type of security development life

281
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,440
cycle they've never heard of a sdlc they

282
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,579
just want to make the Blinky lights

283
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,800
blink make everything work and then they

284
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,019
move on to the next job

285
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,660
so we go into organizations today and

286
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,360
again this is back in 2016. that their

287
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
devices are still vulnerable to Mirai

288
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
in fact we still see organizations today

289
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,200
that their devices have already been

290
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
infected by Mirai and they're still

291
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,760
being controlled but as long as they're

292
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,800
printing or the Voiceover IP phones

293
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
working or the security camera is doing

294
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,040
its thing no one's paying a lot of

295
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,320
attention now this was kind of the first

296
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,079
generation of X iot attacks which were

297
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,540
opportunistic let me just add you to my

298
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,399
botna and then with that botnet I'll do

299
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,980
black hat search engine optimization

300
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,420
phishing attacks malware distribution

301
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,839
DDOS so on and so forth but this has

302
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,100
evolved

303
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,800
the next generation is lateral movement

304
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
and this is the big one so when I think

305
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,060
of the the whole world of xit attacks

306
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,680
it's really three areas it's that

307
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,140
opportunistic botnet stuff it's using

308
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,720
xiot to attack it assets which we're

309
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,820
going to talk about here and it's that

310
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,320
physical world stuff we talked about

311
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,140
like spying unlocking doors shutting

312
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,880
down the power things of this nature

313
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,740
those are the three big categories but

314
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,360
this one's called quiet exit and this

315
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,100
was released by mandian earlier this

316
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,279
year so the way this worked is the

317
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,720
attackers got in through traditional

318
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,940
fishing techniques on it assets like a

319
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,100
laptop through social media through

320
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,200
messaging through email I'm going to go

321
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,600
ahead and get some malware on your

322
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,579
laptop but I know you've got network

323
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,500
security and application security and

324
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,120
endpoint security encryption and all

325
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,560
these things you're spending all this

326
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,079
money on so I don't want to stay there I

327
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,820
want to quickly look for xiot devices

328
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,740
that you're not paying attention to and

329
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,000
in this particular case they were

330
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,940
looking for network attached storage

331
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,800
security cameras load balancers wireless

332
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,959
access points voice over IP phones

333
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,940
things like this again on the network

334
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,000
side it's all BSD and on the iot side

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,260
that they were looking at it was all

336
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
pretty much Linux and a little bit of

337
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,040
Android so they weren't like crazy

338
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
unknown operating systems so they got

339
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,779
access to these devices and once they

340
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,060
were there they installed uh drop bear

341
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,880
which is just a reverse SSH tunnel so

342
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,980
once that was recompiled to be loaded on

343
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,540
these network devices or these iot

344
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,600
devices they could control them remotely

345
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,899
so I got in through it I pivoted to xiot

346
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,060
and now I can control that xiot device

347
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,420
once there they were making AP API calls

348
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,120
to local Exchange Server and Office 365

349
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,680
in the cloud

350
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,720
they started extracting emails email

351
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
attachments all the messages going back

352
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,260
and forth especially for executives

353
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,600
security teams M A groups so on and so

354
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,500
forth

355
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,019
the reason they moved here was because

356
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,480
they could evade detection

357
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,959
and they could avoid any type of sort of

358
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,339
security tools that might have been in

359
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,200
place had they looked at an I.T

360
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
perspective so I'm going to maintain

361
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,800
that persistence I'm going to evade a

362
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,480
detection I'm going to continue to make

363
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,579
these calls and exfiltrate data and

364
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,260
almost every case they were there for

365
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,060
over 18 months

366
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,700
over 18 months of making API calls and

367
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,260
grabbing every single organizational

368
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,339
email

369
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,740
and they did it from some X iot devices

370
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,040
and the fun part is why compromise One X

371
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,720
iot device when you could compromise

372
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,680
thousands it gives you a much better way

373
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,540
to maintain that persistence in your

374
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,980
network

375
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,440
so here's a recent takedown this was a

376
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,200
Russian botnet called our socks and what

377
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,760
was really interesting about this in

378
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,019
fact the only really interesting thing

379
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,300
about it it was such a successful botnet

380
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,820
actually it was so uh well constructed

381
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,560
that they were renting it out for about

382
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,180
thirty dollars a day so people could use

383
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,220
it for DDOS attacks for a hundred

384
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,660
dollars a day you could rent it out and

385
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,120
you had full 24x7 technical support as

386
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,399
well so they were running running this

387
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,600
like a real company

388
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,579
but what I think is interesting about

389
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,740
this one is the primary target where

390
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,600
industrial Control Systems which were

391
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,639
mostly real-time operating systems now

392
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,260
industrial Control Systems sometimes are

393
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,240
Linux sometimes there's windows but

394
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
usually VX works and other things of

395
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,959
this nature but they didn't do it so

396
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,060
they could blow something up or you know

397
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,699
change voltage on something or screw up

398
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,440
some mixture in a batch manufacturing

399
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,300
plant they just did it to add it to a

400
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,860
bot and there were some network devices

401
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,660
there were some iot devices but it was

402
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,339
mostly industrial control systems but it

403
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,160
was very very powerful that takedown as

404
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
you know most takedowns the way they

405
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,459
work think of it like DNS you know

406
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,019
you've got all these subsections

407
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,300
reporting finally up to a Master if you

408
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,160
can take that out you can kind of take

409
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,079
the botnet down at least for a few weeks

410
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,860
until they rebuilt someplace else

411
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,000
Siemens had an attack that came out

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
pretty recently with a horrible name the

413
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,519
S7 plus crash attack uh this kind of

414
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,199
tells you how easy some of these attacks

415
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,579
are on the industrial control system

416
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,279
side so essentially think of a device

417
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,380
like this that controls temperature and

418
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,660
in in the OT world we call these set

419
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,600
points so the temperature can go as slow

420
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,940
as 70 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as

421
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,560
80 degrees Fahrenheit if it goes lower

422
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
or higher I'm going to send an alarm to

423
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
escape device it's going to alert me

424
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,019
something bad has happened okay so it's

425
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,720
there so let's say I log in and I change

426
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,220
it and I say hey I want to increase the

427
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,800
temperature now to 120 degrees which

428
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,019
should be way past that point But as

429
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,519
soon as I do that I start sending

430
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,440
packets and I can use something as

431
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,959
simple as netcat to send a packet on TCP

432
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,839
to Port 102 by simply sending packets on

433
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,880
Port 102 to the Siemens device it does a

434
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,279
Dos attack it can't communicate it says

435
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,660
oh something bad's happening the

436
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,060
temperature is going way over the point

437
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,399
it should be going on my set point but I

438
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,779
can't tell anybody because somebody said

439
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,519
me a packet on Port 102 and I'm still

440
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,360
trying to figure out what that thing

441
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,980
means because I wasn't designed to

442
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,320
understand that so it's important about

443
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
this particular attack was Siemens came

444
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,380
out and says look guys we have some

445
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,600
great security fixes for you the first

446
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,880
thing is patch your system

447
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,199
so we think you should update your

448
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,480
firmware the second one is enable

449
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,339
password control a lot of these devices

450
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,440
don't even come with password control

451
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,959
enabled that's a checkbox third thing

452
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,899
once you do that set a password

453
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,820
and then the fourth thing is turn off

454
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,459
Services you don't need like clear text

455
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,500
clear text protocols Bluetooth low low

456
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,959
energy things of this nature

457
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,699
these are pretty basic things right

458
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,560
these aren't things that in the IT world

459
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,180
that we think of as very groundbreaking

460
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,940
in fact I like to say this that xiot

461
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,699
security today is like I.T security was

462
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,720
in in 1995 and I made this slide before

463
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,880
Coolio we all know he recently died so

464
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,079
rest in peace Coolio but in 1995 that's

465
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,900
about when I got started working in I.T

466
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,699
Security in my very first project this

467
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,220
was at disa I had to go around and find

468
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,079
all these U.S robotics modems that were

469
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,280
plugged in and nobody was tracking

470
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,839
because that was the great evil of the

471
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,640
world at that point hackers were going

472
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,199
to get in through dial-up modems and

473
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,000
take over the world and launch nuclear

474
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,679
weapons and all that stuff so I

475
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
downloaded this tool that ran on dos

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,080
called Tone Loc written by Minor Threat

477
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,299
and mucho Moss all it was was a war

478
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,880
dialer and the PBX guys hated me on all

479
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,740
these bases because it would ring every

480
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,600
single number so Queen sequentially

481
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,419
within the entire base looking for the

482
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,340
response of a dial-up modem and then

483
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,660
once I found that modem I had to figure

484
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,340
out to have an owner if it doesn't I put

485
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,919
it in a bucket I had many many buckets

486
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,960
filled with these U.S robotics modems

487
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,059
the next thing I got into in that time

488
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,440
frame was there was this tool called

489
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
Satan I don't know if any of you ever

490
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,380
used it but it was one of the first

491
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,820
vulnerability scanners it was before

492
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,640
iss's freeware version I think it stood

493
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,500
for Security administrator tool for

494
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,200
analyzing networks I had it loaded on my

495
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
son pizza box I think it was Solaris

496
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,419
2.51 is what I was running and I was

497
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,679
using this for vulnerability scanning

498
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,760
and somebody said hey we want to install

499
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,140
this new thing called the firewall

500
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,760
what's a firewall nobody had really

501
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,900
talked about it too much at that point

502
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,600
it was all ACLS so the device that I was

503
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,820
doing my vulnerability scanning on we

504
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,620
actually had set up as a firewall

505
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,780
because I was the only person that had a

506
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,460
workstation that had two Nicks so we

507
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,039
could have internet facing and internal

508
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,200
facing so it just goes to show you how

509
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
basic things were back then so password

510
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,900
management discovery of your devices

511
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,840
firmware and Patch management these

512
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,840
things were in the early early days and

513
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,260
it's the same way for X iot today for

514
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,700
those of you who are just starting to

515
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,100
get into cyber security take a serious

516
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,020
look at this being the new new because

517
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,580
this will probably carry your career for

518
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,320
at least the next two decades this is

519
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
what everybody is talking about this is

520
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,520
what all the buzz is now on the dark net

521
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,140
this is where a lot of nation state

522
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,000
Investments are going right now cyber

523
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,500
criminals are going after this in a big

524
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,620
way if you're new to this space or you

525
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,919
have more time left in the space

526
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,260
consider this as an area of focus

527
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,460
so

528
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,440
we have a lot of interesting research

529
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,419
stats that we've discovered over the

530
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,179
last five years looking into X iot we've

531
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,380
looked at millions and millions of

532
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,620
devices across all geographies uh

533
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,419
private sector public sector so on and

534
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:37,679
so forth so here's some interesting

535
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,179
stats

536
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,520
what we've discovered is there's roughly

537
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,320
three to five x iot devices per employee

538
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,380
for every company so a company of 10 000

539
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,280
people has roughly between 30 to 50

540
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,860
000 X iot devices

541
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,780
that's a lot it's a lot more than you'd

542
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,580
think and in fact it's so much more than

543
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,440
you'd think that on average when we go

544
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,240
into a company and I say hey guys guess

545
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,100
how many devices you think you have if

546
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,320
they tell me 50 000 I know in the back

547
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,940
of my head okay they got about a hundred

548
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,380
thousand because they're always off by

549
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,140
40 to 60 percent because oh I forgot

550
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,299
about all the door locks oh I forgot we

551
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,460
had that many security cameras Oh I

552
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,500
forgot about KVM switches and lights out

553
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,539
management we forget about all these

554
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:22,740
things because no one's ever managed

555
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,179
them because there was never a way to do

556
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,679
it before so they're just sitting there

557
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,380
vulnerable open exposed now there's a

558
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,100
bit of a bell curve to this law firms

559
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,299
have a little bit less than three to

560
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,720
five uh retail has quite a bit more in

561
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,460
industrial manufacturing both batch and

562
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,220
discrete have a lot lot more so but on

563
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,500
average again three to five devices per

564
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,660
employee

565
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,000
um so audience participation what

566
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,340
percentage of X iot devices do you think

567
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,280
operate with default passwords

568
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,260
95

569
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,580
see

570
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,500
you're also pessimistic so 50 roughly

571
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,600
now again there's a curve to that too

572
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,120
audio video equipment is closer to about

573
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,940
99. if you have like we talked about

574
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,820
before in APC UPS system

575
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,020
good luck

576
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,900
right now when we talk about this also

577
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,980
what you find out is when those

578
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,620
passwords were changed

579
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,419
maybe they were changed once at the time

580
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,039
of implementation because it required a

581
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,179
password change

582
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,840
rotation frequency every 90 days

583
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,700
complexity probably a four digit PIN

584
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,460
and length again probably a four digit

585
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,580
PIN so not really good password policy

586
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,480
because how are you going to do it

587
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
you're going to send somebody around

588
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,000
with a paper clip to reset every single

589
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,280
video camera in a casino probably not

590
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,900
right so there was no way to do it at

591
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,159
scale

592
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,500
so what percentage of X iot devices

593
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,280
operate with end of life firmware

594
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,399
okay

595
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,559
70. okay

596
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:01,020
26 so 26 end of life however

597
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,020
on average six years old

598
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,760
so imagine trying to operate that

599
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,020
smartphone that's sitting in front of

600
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,340
all of you right now with an operating

601
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,380
system or any app on there that was six

602
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,720
years old it probably just wouldn't work

603
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,620
right

604
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,059
but these are the devices that are

605
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,760
controlling critical things and a lot of

606
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,460
these devices help manage other devices

607
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,860
UPS racks KVM lights out management so

608
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,720
on and so forth so if this is a big

609
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,380
problem and with old firmware comes

610
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,940
vulnerabilities now this one when we

611
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,260
started researching it we had to go

612
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,340
through the data a few more times

613
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,080
because this is really sad

614
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,260
68 percent had CVSs scores so CBE

615
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,120
ratings you know 1 to 10 10 being the

616
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,600
worst of 8 9 and 10. almost 70 percent

617
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,179
had eight nine or ten which means a

618
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,000
hacker with very little to no skill in

619
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
fact we would even call him a hacker

620
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,000
we'll just say a person with a laptop

621
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,740
that can access the device that

622
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,179
for some reason it doesn't have the

623
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,799
default password oh my gosh how will I

624
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,640
get in

625
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,500
well at this level it attack you can get

626
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,120
administrative access with little to no

627
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,880
effort and little to no skill right so

628
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,980
that's a that's a huge power if I told

629
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,960
you this was on your it assets today

630
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,419
you'd get up and go fix this right away

631
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,820
this is Earth shattering but again these

632
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,200
are Linux devices these are Android

633
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,900
devices these are BSD devices they're

634
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,820
being compromised they're being taken

635
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,620
over the only difference is we're not

636
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,000
monitoring them we're not protecting

637
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,100
them like we used to or like we should

638
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,320
be so who are the biggest offenders this

639
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,400
is fun

640
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,940
so we went through and there's actually

641
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,440
a very large list we have that are the

642
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,880
biggest offenders I can't spend the

643
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,380
whole presentation talking about it so I

644
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,320
limited it just to a handful but um

645
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,299
we'll start off with this one KVM so

646
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,760
keyboard video Mouse so KVM switches

647
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,380
suck

648
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,020
and this is why you can have a KVM

649
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,340
switch and I think most of you are

650
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,380
familiar but if you're not think of a

651
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,960
rack with a KVM switch one Mouse One

652
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,419
keyboard one monitor plugged into a

653
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,460
dozen two dozen three dozen servers okay

654
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,500
it's that simple

655
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,539
the problem is a lot of these guys are

656
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,000
running Ubuntu version 10 which is about

657
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,039
a decade old I guess you find something

658
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,740
that works and you just stick with it

659
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,299
the issue with this is that's filled

660
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,100
with vulnerabilities but you don't need

661
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,539
to really worry about that because it's

662
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,100
always a default password nobody ever

663
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,600
changes the passwords on their KVM

664
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,640
switches so if you can get access to the

665
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,100
KVM switch you have direct access to the

666
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
servers it's connected to without

667
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,039
worrying about all the other pesky

668
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,440
details so this is a really really

669
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,539
powerful capability so if you can get

670
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,880
access to the KVM switch you can access

671
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
everything else

672
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,320
next one help me out here lights out

673
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,059
management controls

674
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,440
suck

675
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,179
and this is why they suck

676
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,740
so lightsab Management's actually even

677
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,600
more powerful than kbm they're usually

678
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,860
installed into the back of your most

679
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,600
critical devices you might have heard

680
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,580
terms like ipmi ILO idrac these are just

681
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,220
little Linux servers that's all they are

682
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,840
little Linux servers that are connected

683
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,100
to the network that allow you to do

684
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,780
things like

685
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,000
turn the power on and off

686
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
you can change network settings you can

687
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,320
open up a shell you can spawn a virtual

688
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,659
terminal you can upload software so you

689
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,720
have very rich capabilities people

690
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,340
always forget that these things are

691
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,720
there and this is one of the areas that

692
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,159
we say guess how many devices that you

693
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,299
have that are connected that we can

694
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,880
discover oh we forgot all about our

695
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
lights out management devices is that

696
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,480
really a problem it's a huge problem

697
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,640
right so if you're not tracking these

698
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,760
devices it's really opening you up

699
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,000
okay server cabinets and racks

700
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,480
suck and this is why just like you so

701
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
these things have uh Cable Management

702
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,580
they have tamper management they have

703
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,220
ups and power supply capability

704
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,440
which means that if I'm going to reboot

705
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,820
this device because I do a firmware

706
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,559
update it means everything connected to

707
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,640
that is going to be have to be power

708
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,220
cycled as well which means nobody ever

709
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,179
does it

710
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,039
these things once they're installed

711
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,720
they're their default configuration

712
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,400
which leaves them vulnerable in

713
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,779
everything that's within those devices

714
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:03,299
vulnerable as well so this is one that

715
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,880
people really often look over so I like

716
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,440
to call these devices that manage other

717
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,480
devices the KVM switches the lights out

718
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,120
the server cabinets and racks

719
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,500
okay physical access controllers suck so

720
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,240
this now you guys are getting it so this

721
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,260
is the thing

722
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,120
we we went into a financial services

723
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,640
organization and said hey let's let's

724
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,500
find out what kind of xiot devices you

725
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,120
have oh we see you have a lot of digital

726
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,880
door locks in fact he had 6400 of them

727
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,279
within about I want to say 10 seconds

728
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,900
but it was probably closer to five but

729
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,820
we'll go ahead and say 10. we're able to

730
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,100
show them how we could lock and unlock

731
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,320
any doors in the building at will with

732
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,080
no hacking required including things

733
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,059
like the front door which is probably a

734
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,100
pretty big deal

735
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,480
and they said wow that's really a

736
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
problem that we have all these digital

737
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,659
door locks that no one's actually paying

738
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,220
attention to I believe these guys are

739
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,919
all running Linux as well there's a very

740
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,539
popular company called nordex security

741
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:01,020
that ships with uh level 9.8 out of 10

742
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,820
and level 10 out of 10 vulnerabilities

743
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,279
in their default systems and it's not to

744
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,559
say this is a bad company it's just

745
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,059
again to explain to you there is no

746
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,740
security development life cycle for many

747
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,480
of these companies they're not looking

748
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,400
at this from a cyber perspective at all

749
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
they only look at this as a network

750
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,900
device that's there but it's doing a

751
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,279
physical thing so we're not really doing

752
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,900
any cyber security checking on these

753
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,720
devices so big big vulnerabilities when

754
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,159
it comes to door locks and this could be

755
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,860
CAC right this could be badge readers

756
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,799
this could be digital keypads anything

757
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,600
of that nature

758
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,539
okay printers suck

759
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,340
printers suck primarily because they're

760
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,200
super promiscuous oh Brian what do you

761
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,520
mean they're super promiscuous well I'll

762
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,559
tell you they want to connect and talk

763
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,179
to you on every single port and protocol

764
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,039
possible because they want to be easy to

765
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,380
use they're wired they're wired lists

766
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,140
they've got talent open SSH HTTP https

767
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,360
and everything else in between they want

768
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,520
to be easy to use

769
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,500
the problem with these guys is most of

770
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,059
them ship with about an 80 gig hard

771
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,100
drive the Enterprise ones by today's

772
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,600
standard it's not really big not really

773
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,640
small but it's pretty large

774
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,460
they're pretty easy to get access to

775
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,260
passwords are usually again default and

776
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,700
if they're not default passwords there's

777
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,840
a lot of vulnerabilities that you can

778
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,580
compromise once you get onto these

779
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,620
printers here's the fun part you can

780
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,140
start looking for other it devices on

781
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,460
that Network to start attacking an

782
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,620
exfiltrate data so we are working with

783
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,080
one customer it was a major Hotel chain

784
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,000
they had about 60 000 printers across

785
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,100
their hotel chain they had about 2 000

786
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,260
of them had been compromised what was

787
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,880
happening is they were on these printers

788
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,380
these attackers they had their malware

789
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,820
on there it was going out it was

790
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,380
enumerating shares it was grabbing

791
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,940
sensitive data off networks it was

792
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,740
sniffing traffic it was pulling that

793
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,179
down onto the server and then it was

794
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,820
exfiltrating over icmp has anybody here

795
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,580
ever done icmp data X fill

796
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,860
so when you do it over icmp it's low and

797
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,480
slow so it's like I have a bag of rice

798
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,480
and I have an empty box and I take one

799
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,100
grain at a time and I stick it in the

800
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,679
Box it's very monotonous but it also

801
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,080
flies under the radar and icmp Echo

802
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,700
request 3 is always allowed out because

803
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,960
someone on the network Administration

804
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,400
team opened it up because they wanted to

805
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,539
Ping something and do a test and they

806
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,220
forgot to turn it off nobody talked to

807
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,779
security so it's up and open for all

808
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,340
times forever

809
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,159
that happens all the time attackers know

810
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,960
that so you see if I can get onto your

811
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
device I can steal sensitive data I

812
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,820
compress it I exfiltrate it over icmp

813
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,279
and nobody will detect this thing

814
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,220
so it's a great great way to exfiltrate

815
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,899
data and these devices are always

816
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,000
vulnerable and the biggest part of it is

817
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,039
is there's a lot of them organizations

818
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,000
have tons and tons and tons of printers

819
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,980
okay voice over IP phones and video

820
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,460
conference systems suck now here's

821
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,980
something fun so this voice over IP

822
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,720
phone not the one pictured here because

823
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,880
not calling anybody out but there was a

824
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,399
voice over IP phone that shipped with

825
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,520
Port 22 SSH enabled completely

826
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,220
undocumented so much so that the vendor

827
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,020
didn't even realize they had Port 22

828
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,659
enabled and running on their phone we

829
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:01,860
talk about

830
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,159
shared libraries white labeling all the

831
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,659
way down to not even knowing what ports

832
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:07,679
you're running on the device that you're

833
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,880
selling to people

834
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,559
we see a lot of these video conference

835
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,299
systems as well we talked about spying

836
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,860
before a lot of these will be in

837
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,899
executive boardrooms they're always on

838
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,940
even when you think they're off and

839
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,260
they're always streaming that data back

840
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,179
these are very very powerful exploits

841
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,520
most of these guys are Android that

842
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,340
operate on these systems by the way

843
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,559
so out of all the systems we've talked

844
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,779
about which one do you think absolutely

845
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,360
sucks the most what x iot device do you

846
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
think is the number one worst offender

847
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,000
okay yeah cameras you're right

848
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,520
security cameras suck the most and this

849
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,080
is why because when you go into

850
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,520
organization you tell them how

851
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,740
vulnerable their security cameras are

852
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,179
it's kind of like the end of Spider-Man

853
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,539
where they're all pointing at each other

854
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,340
who's supposed to be securing this well

855
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,260
it's facilities right no it's not us

856
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,899
it's it's I.T no no it's a network team

857
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,580
uh-uh it's the security no it's a third

858
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,320
party vendor nobody wants to take

859
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,539
responsibility why would you

860
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,700
we were working with a casino

861
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,860
and these numbers are staggering when

862
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,000
you think about when you think about it

863
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,340
makes sense they had over 50

864
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,179
000

865
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,779
security cameras 50 000. just incredible

866
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,039
right

867
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,380
um all their cameras were compromised

868
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,480
and they're all being they're all crypto

869
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,159
jacked so they're all being used for

870
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,140
mining crypto

871
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,220
well

872
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,720
they're very powerful most of these

873
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,039
cameras were really high-end cameras

874
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,659
much more powerful than our laptops

875
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,240
right and they're all running Linux I

876
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,919
think maybe busy box and some other

877
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,260
things but mostly Linux and on these

878
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,120
cameras they were doing crypto mining

879
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,860
guess how they detected that they were

880
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,219
hacked

881
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,159
ah power bill that's correct so casinos

882
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm guessing have pretty high power

883
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,760
bills to begin with their power bill

884
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,200
increased by a thousand percent

885
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,760
so that's an anomaly

886
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,820
um

887
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,100
I would love to say Splunk and some

888
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,899
correlation rule or some might notice

889
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,520
that the person that managed the power

890
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,159
bill said hey what happened right and

891
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,899
there was actually another case at a

892
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,320
different Casino where they had a x iot

893
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,240
thermometer in a fish tank

894
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,220
just a thermometer and a fish tank that

895
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,620
was accessed by some attackers they used

896
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,080
that to jump into the database that they

897
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,520
keep for all their high rollers all

898
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,860
their whales so it had personal

899
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,840
information it had financial information

900
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,299
had travel details it had a lot of very

901
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,820
sensitive information extremely high net

902
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,980
worth individuals all from a saltwater

903
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,679
fish tank thermometer right so on the

904
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,179
security cameras again the interesting

905
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,559
thing is they can be used for those

906
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,140
physical attacks to spy on you they can

907
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,539
be used to add to a botnet they can be

908
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,159
used for crypto jacking and things of

909
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,860
this nature and because of their the

910
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,120
fact that there's so many of these

911
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,559
devices and they're so vulnerable and

912
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,940
you saw in that early Showdown search

913
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,840
how many of those are internet

914
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,100
accessible

915
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,779
they're a massive Target

916
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,340
now again you don't need to be internet

917
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,440
accessible most of these attacks are

918
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,940
getting in through traditional means

919
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,779
through I.T than attacking xiot to

920
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,500
maintain persistence and avoid detection

921
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,940
that's what you have to think about

922
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,039
these are just other I.T tools that are

923
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,419
being used to attack the rest of your it

924
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:16,919
environment

925
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,860
so beyond we've talked a lot about

926
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,659
Enterprise a little bit of industrial

927
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,820
but this maps to the military as well

928
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,460
there's a lot of Internet of Battlefield

929
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,539
things on soldiers on aircraft on

930
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,640
terrestrial vehicles

931
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
this stuff is everywhere there's Health

932
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,500
Care specific devices as well smart

933
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,659
ships smart buildings smart cities all

934
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,100
kind of fall into the same category

935
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,840
which is interesting if you think about

936
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,460
it I think the first the first

937
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,500
unofficial X iot device was a Coke

938
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,399
machine

939
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,899
a Coke soda machine it was put on

940
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,779
arpanet like 1988 right and they tracked

941
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,039
how many cans of coke were still in

942
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,539
there pretty basic just a fun little

943
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,360
research project the first official iot

944
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,000
device was a announced at interop and I

945
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
think it was 1995. and it was a TCP

946
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,640
toaster right same thing

947
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,359
so in 1995 we had a tcpip

948
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,520
ex-iot toaster

949
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,418
today in 2022 we have complete smart

950
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,060
cities Dublin Ireland is the world's

951
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,460
largest interconnected smart city in the

952
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,839
world that is being used kind of as the

953
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,599
beacon for all other cities that want to

954
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,940
be smart Cities traffic emergency

955
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,899
services water and sanitation how people

956
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,119
are moving Health Care everything is

957
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,800
interconnected

958
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,139
and this is the way the model is moving

959
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,418
after this I'm actually flying to London

960
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,339
for a week and then Dubai for a week and

961
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,960
about 50 of the time I'm there it's

962
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,580
about how they're moving to a Smart City

963
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,540
design

964
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,300
so everybody's embracing this and think

965
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,520
about that with all the stats and

966
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,560
figures and crazy stuff that we just

967
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,540
talked about before stuff starts to get

968
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,639
pretty real really fast right because we

969
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,900
didn't have to really deal with this in

970
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,359
1995 with it but we're certainly dealing

971
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,520
with this now with x iot

972
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,599
so

973
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
I don't like to give these talks and

974
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,680
just talk about all the kind of bad and

975
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,240
just leave it like that there's there's

976
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,960
ways to address these things and I don't

977
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
want to pitch any products but I do want

978
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,140
to talk about a new category of

979
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,180
solutions and at the end I'll share some

980
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,619
various vendors out there that you guys

981
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,300
can check out a lot of them have free

982
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,859
versions that you can kick the tires on

983
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,900
these are called Enterprise X iot

984
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,880
security platforms something completely

985
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,859
new it's not a Sim it's not a firewall

986
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,839
it's not a vulnerability scanner it's a

987
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,700
completely new genre of products and

988
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,839
some of these companies you may have

989
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,579
heard of some of you may have not but

990
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,020
I'd like to give give folks some

991
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,060
Solutions on the other side of these

992
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,440
so

993
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,619
the first big issue with xiot is

994
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:44,820
Discovery

995
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,740
as we talked about before when we go

996
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,240
into the organization we say how many

997
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,579
devices do you think you have people are

998
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,099
usually off by 40 to 60 percent they

999
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,260
simply don't know what they have

1000
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,079
and again just like it was back in 1995

1001
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,520
people didn't really have a good idea

1002
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,020
what devices they had in their Network

1003
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,180
and there's some issues if you look at

1004
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,980
some of the traditional ways of doing

1005
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,079
Discovery think about a vulnerability

1006
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,780
scanner a tenable a qualis a rapid seven

1007
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,119
they're all predicated a 1990s

1008
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,680
vulnerability scanner technology which

1009
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,359
works by setting malform packets to

1010
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,099
devices and seeing how those devices

1011
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,500
respond do any of you here work in

1012
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,420
industrial control system OT kind of

1013
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,980
scada worlds

1014
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,260
so a few of you you're never going to

1015
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,339
let somebody go into your environment

1016
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,140
start running a vulnerability scanner

1017
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,760
because a lot of your devices were built

1018
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,560
in a vacuum and your tcpip stack will

1019
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,640
say look I don't know what that is so

1020
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm just going to roll over and die it

1021
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,960
will impact availability in the world of

1022
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,000
OT it's all in CIA confidentiality

1023
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,980
Integrity availability it's all about

1024
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,599
availability a little bit of Integrity

1025
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,700
but almost all availability

1026
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,280
so you cannot use those traditional

1027
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,380
means and for even Enterprise iot

1028
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,119
devices some printers and things like

1029
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,820
that it can knock those over as well so

1030
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,800
you don't want to use that well if I

1031
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,660
can't scan what's my other option well

1032
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,660
maybe I can sniff okay well sniffing's

1033
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,940
not bad it's hard to scale throughout an

1034
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,140
entire environment because you need a

1035
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,880
lot of TAPS and span ports and things

1036
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,740
like that it can be very very

1037
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,500
ineffective from that approach the other

1038
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,240
problem is most of these devices do use

1039
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,460
encrypted communication so while you can

1040
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,440
do Discovery you might not be able to

1041
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,300
glean the metadata necessary in order to

1042
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,920
make an empirical decision of what this

1043
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,900
device actually is I might be able to

1044
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,780
say something like I'm 80 sure you're a

1045
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,000
printer or I'm 50 sure you're a voice

1046
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,040
over IP phone but heck you could be an

1047
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,260
MRI machine I don't know so that doesn't

1048
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,880
really work as well

1049
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,500
so then you've got

1050
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,020
sort of asset Discovery tools that work

1051
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,000
by looking at Mac addresses so the oui

1052
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,099
the organizational unique identifier or

1053
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,440
the first six octets of it anyhow and

1054
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,420
they basically say oh you're jet direct

1055
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,240
so you must be a printer right not

1056
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,980
really jet direct could actually be

1057
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,020
tagged to things that aren't printers as

1058
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,599
well so there's a whole slew of reasons

1059
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,000
why old school approaches to Discovery

1060
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,300
simply doesn't work for xiot it can

1061
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,339
either be dangerous or it can be

1062
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,800
inconclusive but either way it's not a

1063
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,300
very good combination

1064
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,520
so the way these Enterprise iot security

1065
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,320
platforms and again I'll share a couple

1066
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480
of these uh players at the end of the

1067
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,820
presentation the way they work is they

1068
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,980
actually do interrogation and what's

1069
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,380
that mean so think of C-3PO from Star

1070
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,820
Wars he could speak like a million

1071
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,140
languages one of them was like water

1072
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,300
evaporators and things like that you

1073
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,859
have to be able to speak the language of

1074
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,480
the devices that they were designed to

1075
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,920
speak so they've all built these

1076
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,320
abstraction layers to say oh you're a

1077
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,000
printer I'm going to talk the way you

1078
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,280
expect to be spoken to oh you're a PLC

1079
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,440
device you're a network attached storage

1080
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,900
device this device expects some type of

1081
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,119
specialized Windows client this device

1082
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,099
is SSH this device is telling that this

1083
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,240
is this you kind of get the picture

1084
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,280
there's thousands and thousands and

1085
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,079
thousands and thousands of ways to do

1086
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,820
this it's nuts

1087
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,040
but in doing that you're able to

1088
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,140
actually interrogate these devices and

1089
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,599
find out what are you what firmware what

1090
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,640
version what model number what are your

1091
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,900
passwords what are your ports and

1092
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,160
protocols

1093
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,780
what's the status of your certificates

1094
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,880
things of this nature right so you can

1095
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,740
actually interrogate these devices and

1096
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,500
identify what it is empirically if you

1097
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,060
can do that you can move on to the next

1098
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,400
stage which is much more important but

1099
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,920
at least now you know empirically what

1100
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,140
you have in your organization and you

1101
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,820
can reinterrogate your environment as

1102
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,500
often as you need to to kind of build up

1103
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,720
this list is it going to be 100 probably

1104
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,740
not

1105
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,240
but it's certainly better than nothing

1106
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,700
and it's probably close to about 90 95

1107
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,619
percent in most cases so it's pretty

1108
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,079
darn good and again the big thing about

1109
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,359
interrogation is it's safe and it's

1110
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,220
scalable right I've seen this being used

1111
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,320
in military I've seen this used in

1112
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,180
manufacturing Healthcare financial

1113
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,579
services so on so know what you've got

1114
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,260
kind of Step One

1115
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,180
now that you know what you've got you

1116
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,359
can go to step two which is remediation

1117
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,339
which is really the big thing because

1118
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,200
it's one thing to say hey look I found a

1119
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,579
hundred thousand devices and by the way

1120
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,680
they've all got default passwords and

1121
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,940
they're all vulnerable and they're all

1122
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,040
running clear text protocols so have a

1123
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,800
good weekend right it's nice to say okay

1124
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,480
let's go to step two

1125
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,859
so one of the things you want to do in

1126
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,599
step two is actually fix the firmware

1127
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,119
and Harden so this has to do with

1128
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,560
upgrading these devices so a lot of

1129
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,940
these devices as we talked about before

1130
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,920
they're really old they're end of life

1131
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,420
firmware in some cases the companies

1132
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,980
have got out of business

1133
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,960
in some cases they're you know six years

1134
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,880
plus it's not uncommon to find these

1135
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,560
devices that have

1136
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,599
um firmware that's over a decade old

1137
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,760
especially in the operating or on the OT

1138
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,000
side where you're looking at things like

1139
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,740
I have a device that's a PLC that's

1140
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,540
running a turbine and I depreciate it

1141
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,820
over decades like I do this turbine

1142
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,700
so it used to be if I can't fix this how

1143
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,160
would I fix X iot devices in the past

1144
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,040
I'd VLAN them I'd spend a lot of money

1145
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,720
investing in my switching architecture

1146
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,640
to put all these devices behind vlans

1147
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,099
which is very expensive for even a

1148
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,020
mid-sized company we could be talking

1149
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,680
about millions and millions of dollars

1150
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,839
in fact I was working with a company in

1151
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,280
Atlanta yesterday where I think they

1152
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,839
were quoted like five million dollars

1153
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,480
for just vlaning technology which who's

1154
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
going to write the check for that nobody

1155
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,780
it's ridiculous and I'm not against

1156
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,640
vlans I don't think vlans are bad I just

1157
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,020
think it's a very expensive way to try

1158
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,359
to fix something more importantly it

1159
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,339
doesn't fix it the analogy I like to use

1160
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,079
is let's say I'm working on something I

1161
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,579
cut my left hand open and I should

1162
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,020
really go to the doctor

1163
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,760
but instead of that I'm going to stick a

1164
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
plastic sandwich bag on my hand and I'm

1165
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,880
going to wrap it up with duct tape

1166
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,440
so now I'm not getting blood on my

1167
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,300
keyboard or my right hand but I still

1168
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,280
have a bloody hand in a bag which is

1169
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,040
probably a bad idea right well that's

1170
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,960
what a VLAN is it says oh I'm protecting

1171
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,280
everything else but just keep this

1172
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,520
bloody hand over here

1173
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,800
so you still have vulnerable devices so

1174
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,200
if you can upgrade the firmware if you

1175
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,780
can patch it I know such a novel idea

1176
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,839
that takes you a long ways well the

1177
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,760
problem was historically Discovery

1178
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,900
wasn't accurate enough to tell you

1179
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,220
empirically that I know exactly what

1180
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,079
this device is so because of that now I

1181
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,300
can upgrade all your printers or all

1182
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,740
your voice over IP phones or all your

1183
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,900
KVM switch is so on and say forth but

1184
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,060
now you can now you can actually push

1185
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,380
those and this is really cool actually

1186
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,900
you might find out that you've got let's

1187
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,240
take a security camera it has a log for

1188
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,040
J vulnerability I think most of you have

1189
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,619
heard a log4j I think it was it was the

1190
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,500
big news about six months ago well these

1191
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,540
X iot vendors don't move at lightning

1192
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,040
speed when it comes to creating new

1193
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,720
firmware so they go look we know we have

1194
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,400
a log for J vulnerability and we're

1195
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,960
gonna have a patch for this in a year so

1196
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,920
we're going to get it done really quick

1197
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,119
for you

1198
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,920
but you say look I'm on version five

1199
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,480
you're not gonna have version six for a

1200
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,460
year maybe I want to downgrade to

1201
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,079
version four that didn't have that until

1202
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,000
that happens to sort of be a

1203
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,740
compensating control so now you can

1204
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,300
actually even downgrade these devices

1205
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,339
and during that initial Discovery

1206
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,079
process for these Enterprise X iot

1207
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,940
Security Solutions they can actually

1208
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,500
tell you if you're on version five and

1209
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,240
you want to go to version seven you have

1210
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,520
to go five then six to seven as your

1211
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,140
upgrade path or you can go right from

1212
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,640
five to seven

1213
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,460
that's a huge huge Time Saver to know

1214
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,680
that also you don't have to hunt down

1215
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,359
the firmware the biggest problem for

1216
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,800
firmware we've all done it you're at

1217
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,300
home you're like man I should probably

1218
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,520
upgrade my wireless access point or my

1219
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,079
printer so I'm going to Google this

1220
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,339
model number and I'm going to spend an

1221
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,720
hour trying to find this firmware and

1222
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,859
spend another hour trying to figure out

1223
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,200
how to update it and probably either you

1224
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,700
do it or you just give up and you decide

1225
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,980
never to do it again so we've all we all

1226
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,300
fall into that I have a printer next to

1227
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,400
me at home that I have no idea it's I'm

1228
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,900
sure it's already hacked and everyone's

1229
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,760
spying on me but

1230
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,119
if you have the ability now to say I

1231
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,800
don't have to go find the firmware that

1232
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,119
firmware is all going to be kept in some

1233
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,920
Google Cloud cryptologically checksum

1234
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,119
that's how most of these organizations

1235
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,339
work and then I'm going to just say

1236
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,319
upgrade on my HP printers from version

1237
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,660
10 to version 11. all my cameras from

1238
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,339
this to that all devices in Augusta

1239
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,740
today all devices in Atlanta tomorrow

1240
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,960
that sort of thing that allows you to

1241
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,220
really scale

1242
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,380
and then you're not falling into the

1243
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,900
case where you're saying hey I'm 50 sure

1244
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,400
this is a printer so let's go ahead and

1245
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,260
do the upgrade of the firmware and then

1246
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,200
oh zoinks it was an MRI machine and

1247
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,760
people get really mad when you turn a

1248
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,560
two million dollar MRI machine into a

1249
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,520
500 bubble Jet right so it's good to

1250
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,720
have that empirical knowledge

1251
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,400
furthermore I want to be able to harden

1252
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,400
right remember what Siemens said enable

1253
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,780
passwords

1254
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,640
add a password

1255
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,560
patch it turn off stuff you don't need

1256
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,420
well this comes up to Turning stuff you

1257
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,140
don't need shut off telnet tftp FTP HTTP

1258
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,780
just run https and SSH don't run

1259
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,460
wireless just run wired don't run

1260
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,079
Bluetooth at low energy

1261
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,300
etc etc so you can start hardening these

1262
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,380
devices

1263
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,480
the next step is credentials so now I

1264
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,000
found my device I've upgraded my device

1265
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,180
I've hardened my device across my 50 000

1266
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,280
X iot devices now I want to manage

1267
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,859
credentials most of these devices work

1268
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,359
by integrating with tools like Pam

1269
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,160
privilege access management tools cyber

1270
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,140
R cache Corp psychotic there's

1271
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,520
commercial versions free versions

1272
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,380
whatever but they store the actual

1273
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,079
credentials problem they don't speak to

1274
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,180
X iot devices nor do they want to invest

1275
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,380
the time and effort to make their

1276
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,900
devices speak to all these X iot devices

1277
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,780
so what they've done is they said let's

1278
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,520
let the Enterprise X iot security

1279
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,160
platform speak to those X iot devices

1280
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,839
and we'll go ahead and manage the

1281
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,400
credentials on the back and through apis

1282
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,960
so as you're going through that

1283
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,700
Discovery process it's automatically

1284
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,740
enrolling them in the Pam solution then

1285
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,960
every 30 60 90 days it's doing the

1286
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,640
password rotations on those devices

1287
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,040
again using the xiot solution as the

1288
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,380
middleware now the cool thing about this

1289
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,740
is when you're in this situation you

1290
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,060
actually have the knowledge to say well

1291
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,619
this device can only take a four digit

1292
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,599
PIN well this device can actually take

1293
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,460
25 characters but no special characters

1294
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,260
well this printer can take everything

1295
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,020
except a backslash or a hash sign or

1296
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,520
this can't do the letter B we've seen

1297
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,500
the weirdest password configuration

1298
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,480
policies that you can ever imagine for

1299
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,180
these devices but it takes all that out

1300
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,400
and then certs

1301
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,440
almost every single wireless access

1302
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,480
point we run into has a cert that's like

1303
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,560
TLS version 1.1 or 1.2 it's self-signed

1304
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,140
it's expired this is very common because

1305
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,700
there's so many of them it's hard to

1306
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,800
manage these things and keep track just

1307
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,119
like you manage the credentials you can

1308
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,339
manage the certs so now I found my

1309
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,920
device I've upgraded the firmware I've

1310
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,020
hardened it I've managed my credentials

1311
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,599
and now I'm managing my certs that's

1312
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,060
pretty great actually that's taken you

1313
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,940
now on par with what you've got on it so

1314
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,920
that's kind of Step One Discovery step

1315
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,380
two remediation my favorite part is this

1316
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,599
so now you've spent all this time fixing

1317
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,460
everything so you spent the last three

1318
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,500
weeks finding your X iot devices

1319
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,420
upgrading the firmware adding good

1320
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,819
passwords Etc and now you want to make

1321
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,099
sure all that works stays good work in

1322
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,079
perpetuity and you're looking for that

1323
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,240
environmental drift so everything that's

1324
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,000
working stays working and it's a very

1325
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,460
simple process I've got 50 000 devices

1326
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,839
those devices are going to be

1327
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,540
reinterrogated every single day and oh

1328
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,400
this device was in version seven now

1329
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,140
it's in version three somebody must have

1330
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,640
walked by with a paper clip and poked a

1331
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,720
little black dot on the back of the

1332
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,619
device

1333
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,300
or this device did have a great password

1334
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,400
but now it's set back to default or I

1335
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,140
wasn't running telnet but now I am

1336
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,420
running telnet so out of 50 000 devices

1337
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,640
today I can manage by exception because

1338
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,500
here's the five devices I need to look

1339
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,079
at right now and it actually allows me

1340
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,240
to scale and when something changes they

1341
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,480
integrate with things like slack Splunk

1342
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,040
you know titanium de misto all the

1343
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,359
traditional tools that you use for

1344
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:26,579
ticketing service now Etc to do that

1345
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,040
alerting and then you can report on this

1346
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,319
data as well give me a report that shows

1347
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,880
me all the devices in my environment

1348
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,859
right now that are end of life show me

1349
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,119
all the devices that I don't have

1350
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,700
managed by my Pam solution show me all

1351
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,819
devices that have level 9 and 10 cves

1352
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:43,800
just having that type of invisibility

1353
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,020
gives you so many steps beyond what the

1354
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,240
bad guys are hoping for they're hoping

1355
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,160
you'll be apathetic they're hoping

1356
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,220
you'll be passive that's why Russia and

1357
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,960
other countries and cyber criminals are

1358
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,060
investing so heavy fronten wasn't

1359
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,099
developed because they thought there was

1360
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,900
some hedge use case where it might

1361
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,359
become handy frontin was developed

1362
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,040
because they knew the whole world was

1363
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,380
being caught without knowing that this

1364
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,520
was happening

1365
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,500
and I guarantee it's happening all day

1366
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,260
long always everywhere this is the new

1367
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,700
new like I said earlier if you're

1368
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,200
thinking about getting into cyber if

1369
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,480
you're new to this game this is area you

1370
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,400
really want to start focusing on

1371
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,200
so sort of sum up things by the way

1372
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,720
here's a bunch of companies

1373
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,520
a phosphorus wear one you can certainly

1374
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,800
talk to us but order zingbox nozomi

1375
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,960
armis Etc there's a few others as well

1376
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,819
but these are all organizations that

1377
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,920
play in this xiot world

1378
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,200
so some of them just do Discovery some

1379
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,760
of them do Discovery and Remediation

1380
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,280
some of them Focus mostly on vlaning

1381
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,780
whatever I don't even want to say one

1382
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,520
solution's better than the other but

1383
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,599
they're definitely things that you

1384
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,700
should start checking out and for a lot

1385
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,560
of you these might be very new names to

1386
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,900
you right they're not as familiar as

1387
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,720
Splunk and tenable and things like that

1388
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,460
so get to know these get to know these

1389
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,380
types of companies because organizations

1390
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,420
simply don't know what they have because

1391
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,440
they don't know what they have they

1392
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,819
don't know what to fix and if they knew

1393
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,200
how to fix them they can't fix them at

1394
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,220
scale

1395
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,660
and if they were able to fix them at

1396
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,099
scale they're not able to monitor them

1397
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,500
to make sure they stay fixed so that's

1398
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,200
kind of the net net of these so if

1399
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,520
anybody wants to get in touch with me

1400
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,040
here's my here's all my details but I

1401
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,240
think we have a couple minutes do we

1402
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,099
have a couple minutes for Q a so I'll go

1403
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,540
ahead and take a couple questions and we

1404
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,819
have some gifts to give away too so any

1405
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:27,740
questions out there uh yes sir

1406
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,440
yeah so there's actually a lot of great

1407
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,740
sort of iot security conferences X iot

1408
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,180
is a bit of a loaded term because it's

1409
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,160
this umbrella thing but check out some

1410
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,020
of the iot shows there's some of these

1411
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,359
offered through black hat and Defcon I'm

1412
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,740
doing one in London called The iot

1413
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,960
Science Foundation one next week so

1414
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,339
there's a lot of these things coming up

1415
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,440
there's a lot of reading on iot hacking

1416
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,940
so these are all things that I think you

1417
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,440
could take a look at to sort of build up

1418
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,859
your skill set yep great question yes

1419
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:04,098
sir

1420
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:07,819
more popular

1421
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,779
yeah

1422
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,160
there probably are some that are best so

1423
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,960
what are the things we do for fun in our

1424
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,420
Leisure Hours is we go to swap meets and

1425
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,700
we go on uh eBay and places like that

1426
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,380
and we buy a whole bunch of this gear

1427
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,020
and I live in San Francisco and I don't

1428
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,880
know why but our swap meets are filled

1429
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,700
with like healthcare X iot devices

1430
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,819
especially like IVs mobile IV systems

1431
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:46,740
and when we pull those in and we look at

1432
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,839
what's on those devices oftentimes

1433
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,579
you'll find network maps of

1434
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,740
organizations passwords all sorts of

1435
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,119
sensitive details that came out of like

1436
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,559
a healthcare provider things like that

1437
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,079
so some of that's being reused and

1438
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,240
resold through Ali also some of those

1439
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,040
devices that you're getting

1440
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,079
again you get what you pay for and some

1441
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,520
of these devices do come with malware

1442
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,859
pre-shipped so let me ask a couple

1443
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,420
questions to give away the gifts so

1444
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,579
first we have this book go hack yourself

1445
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,079
who wants to tell me what xiot stands

1446
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,200
for

1447
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,540
I only have one book

1448
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,940
so someone raised their hand

1449
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,839
okay right there

1450
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,059
yes you got it and that will be for you

1451
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:32,819
when you're ready and let's see what was

1452
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,040
the name and raise your hand what was

1453
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,000
the name of the attack that mandian

1454
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,859
discovered that gotten through the

1455
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:43,319
fishing attack on it and then pivoted to

1456
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:45,420
ex-iot

1457
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,640
I think you were the first one go ahead

1458
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,700
quiet exit and you get this uh wireless

1459
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,280
adapter deal awesome all right everybody

1460
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,780
thanks so much for your time I really

1461
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,319
appreciate it
