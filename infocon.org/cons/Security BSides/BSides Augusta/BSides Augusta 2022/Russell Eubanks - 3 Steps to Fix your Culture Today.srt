1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,780
thank you

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,140
love coming to besides Augustus so much

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,880
today even looking forward to this

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,859
already got the dates for next year's on

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,840
my calendar but let me take you back in

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,740
time just a little bit

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,859
year was 2015.

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,899
year was 2015.

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,899
and this idea of what is it going to

10
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,059
look like to go start to work at a new

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,860
company and to talk about this idea of

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,239
what are three things that you can do to

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,280
fix your culture today and if we have

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,719
time I've actually got four things we'll

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,820
see how this goes for this topic but as

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,500
I think about what does culture actually

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,660
mean well we can look at the dictionary

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,460
we can figure that out and try to

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,199
understand that a little bit better and

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
maybe it can give us a better vocabulary

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
a little bit better language to

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,500
understand when I talk about culture

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,059
what does that look like

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,900
but I remember back when click

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,320
let me

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,020
2015 I was recruited to go be the Chief

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,580
Information Security Officer at the

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,200
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta you've

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
heard of them their names on the money

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,159
that we spend and go do things and I had

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,259
a great job before that I knew the

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,939
culture I'd worked there for a while I

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,799
knew how things kind of played out there

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,780
how did things work there

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,640
but as they asked me to consider going

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,920
to work literally right there

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,079
I had a bunch of questions sure I wanted

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,640
to know about compensation that's

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
important benefits yep insurance you

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,479
have family and kids that need well

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,000
whatever we need help with

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,159
but if you were to go back to the HR

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,320
recruiter that recruited me for over a

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,360
year to go there

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
and you were to like somehow Place him

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,740
right here and you were to ask the

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,060
question what's the number one question

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,920
Russell asked before making that job

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,439
decision it was around well

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
that were from the previous lab the

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,500
culture

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,439
what's it like to be there

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,199
well I like being there

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,260
well they like me being there

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,080
and those are legit questions I want to

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,340
know that those of you who's changed

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,800
jobs and you're like how do I know what

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,900
it's like here

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,860
but what about there

60
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,660
and honestly the only way I could find

61
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,540
out was when I go to my previous boss

62
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,160
and I say hey boss I think I'm going to

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
go work there instead

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,260
but what I cared the most about was the

65
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,560
culture was I going to like

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,700
to be there

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,140
how could I understand that what are

68
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
some questions I could ask to help me

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,500
put myself in a position before it was

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,980
too late to know that perhaps I did

71
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,739
a bunch of things say I knew about

72
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,140
I had to take two classes in economics

73
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,840
in college so surely I knew how a bank

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,420
worked but how an organization like that

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,920
operates the things that are important

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,720
to them was something that was kind of

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,239
tricky to me

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,920
so what I want to do is walk through

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,200
three steps if we had extra time a bonus

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,319
step to help you understand the language

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,080
some things that you can do to make a

82
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,540
better culture where you're at

83
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,120
right now

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,099
so some of those steps these ideas

85
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,800
things that you can do to fix your

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
culture

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,900
today so the first one is

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,819
maybe a little bit non-technical but

89
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,959
maybe a little bit of a surprise

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,940
afternoon at security besides Augusta

91
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,200
can you believe it's like the 10th year

92
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,879
10th time they haven't I can't even

93
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,940
believe it but this idea of an elevator

94
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,620
speech

95
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,599
so if you heard of you've seen you've

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,220
maybe studied or even practiced an

97
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,440
elevator speech before any heads nodding

98
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,760
any hints of it

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,860
yeah so the premise is this idea let's

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,440
just imagine this pretend scenario where

101
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,260
in this pretend scenario an executive is

102
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,420
a ball someone with an important title

103
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,819
uh gets on the elevator and kind of

104
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,200
awkward it's like I don't know what to

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
say do I even get to talk to them or not

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,580
and actually some executive elevators

107
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,560
actually like when the executives gets

108
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,120
on it it just goes like straight up to

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,399
their floor because they're important to

110
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,100
things like that but if the awkwardness

111
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,320
Fades and

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,660
someone who might be your boss's bosses

113
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,020
bosses boss's boss looks at you and says

114
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,159
what do you do here

115
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,460
what do you say

116
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,100
what are the pardon what do you say

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,780
little is possible because you don't

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,800
want to get fired because it's your

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,699
boss's boss and you wow I see you on TV

120
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,340
but I don't really like see you like up

121
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,000
in my space

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,740
how do we think about

123
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,979
ways to communicate what's going on the

124
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,320
things that are the most important we're

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
kind of Trapped and so initially maybe

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,500
nervously we'll say well I I do cyber

127
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,740
things I block the bad people the apts I

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,960
say some acronyms I talk about packets I

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,540
talk about blocking and attacking and

130
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,639
red teaming and blue teaming and all the

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,259
things that

132
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,660
we could talk about when it's just us

133
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,780
but what about the not us

134
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,400
what about the leaders the decision

135
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,220
makers those who names might actually be

136
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,139
on our paycheck

137
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,419
they don't come to besides they don't go

138
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,580
to classes they don't learn things and

139
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,940
spend time in our Echo chamber

140
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,759
hmm

141
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,220
so while we do the blue team and we do

142
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,840
the red teams and we do all the things

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
that we do GRC all the things that we do

144
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
those are important

145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,180
when someone who's not

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,160
at besides Augusta ask what are the

147
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,139
things that we do

148
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,199
is there a better way

149
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,000
and this is not taking away from the

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
security things that we do

151
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
the risk that we treat the problems that

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,820
we solve the servers that we patch and

153
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,740
the applications that we paint is it's

154
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,880
not taken away from any of those things

155
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,440
at all

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,240
but what if we spoke in a language

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
where that executive that leader that

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,699
boss could

159
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,100
understand it a little bit better so the

160
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,139
first hack for ways to change the

161
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,560
culture

162
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:33,500
foreign has a different approach

163
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,020
what if we decided to not just be

164
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,000
Technical and cyber and all the things

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,220
we do what if we decided that we wanted

166
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,139
to learn how to speak

167
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,539
another language does anyone else speak

168
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,819
more than one language anyone bilingual

169
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,460
what languages do you speak

170
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,000
Spanish English clearly and Spanish you

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
bilingual what if someone in the back

172
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,979
raised their hand yes sir

173
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,319
little German and English now how to

174
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,780
take your word on both of those but you

175
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,759
have that skill you have that ability if

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,340
you had to or maybe you do a lot able to

177
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,319
speak another language

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,120
so what I want to do in this hack here

179
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,940
is to help you speak

180
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,680
another language like a Russell how do

181
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
you do that I don't have an app there's

182
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,160
not a Duolingo how can we speak another

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
language what if we speak

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,080
not Spanish not German and all the other

185
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,699
languages that you know and speak but

186
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,960
what if we learn how to speak the

187
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,919
language

188
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,139
of business

189
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,180
what if we became bilingual and were

190
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,380
able to speak the language of business

191
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,620
and one way to do that

192
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,940
is

193
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,560
to maybe spend a bit of time on your

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,919
company's website or your internet site

195
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,620
and kind of look at the mission

196
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,180
I've worked at a lot of places that just

197
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,919
means I'm old I've done a lot of things

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,800
old I've never worked at a place that

199
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
existed because of cyber like that's not

200
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,720
the reason that's not the mission We

201
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,539
Exist because of cyber there could be

202
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,699
places like that I've not worked at

203
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,099
places like that so let's try this

204
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,560
exercise let's just pretend I had the

205
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,580
authority

206
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,740
and made all of us here

207
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,020
as CSO of a company

208
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,720
named Ted like you've probably seen her

209
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,639
maybe one of you is given a TED talk

210
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,319
before it's kind of like on my goal list

211
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,639
one of the days I want to be able to do

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,440
that but let's just pretend right now

213
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,780
that we become all Chief information

214
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,879
security officers of the company whose

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,180
name is they're on the screen

216
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,339
does anybody know

217
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,440
what the mission statement the reason

218
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,300
why the company Ted exists

219
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,580
it's just two words

220
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,200
just two words

221
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,820
a lot of missions tape was like a bunch

222
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,740
of words a bunch of things and had like

223
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,360
a long t-shirt to put all the words on

224
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,760
there but Ted the company

225
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,480
two words to spread ideas the reason Ted

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,300
the company exists is to spread ideas so

227
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,279
those of you who've watched a TED talk

228
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,560
before what do you think did they do a

229
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,019
good job or a bad job at achieving the

230
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:04,860
mission

231
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,320
see a couple of Thumbs Up couple nods

232
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,360
are they spreading ideas it seems like

233
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,580
they do a good job of spreading

234
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,740
ideas

235
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,380
so if somehow Us in this job I just gave

236
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,940
us isn't it cool we're all csos of the

237
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,339
same company uh Ted the company and we

238
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,720
were on an elevator if they have

239
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,959
elevators at Ted and an executive who's

240
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,680
in charge of and running Ted instead of

241
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,600
responding to cyber things and apt

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,220
things and blue teams and red teams and

243
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,779
pin tests and GRC and all the things

244
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,860
that we do that are important

245
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,480
what if we said

246
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,120
hi I'm Russell I'm the Chief Information

247
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,140
Security Officer and what do I do here

248
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,660
just two words

249
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,560
I spread ideas

250
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,500
so what is the mission the how might be

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,480
blue team the how might be preparing for

252
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,160
the next board briefing or the next

253
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,260
audit that's coming or the the next

254
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,820
thing that needs to happen in my

255
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,500
specific role but

256
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,019
in speaking the language of business it

257
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,820
might just be a good idea I believe it's

258
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,860
a good idea I found it to be a good idea

259
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,019
to help people that understand how to

260
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,580
run and operate businesses to connect

261
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,740
what I'm doing

262
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,300
and what you're doing

263
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,339
and what all of us are doing on a daily

264
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,880
basis without making them go learn cyber

265
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,680
or get a degree or get a certification

266
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,740
in our chosen field

267
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,060
so what would it look like

268
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,080
if we tried

269
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,899
a better way for our elevator speech of

270
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,339
I spread ideas

271
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,440
now picked Ted because Ted's a company

272
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
we've probably heard of we looked at

273
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,399
their talks and thinking about that this

274
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,779
idea of how we might be able to do that

275
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,760
still being respectful of the things

276
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
that we know the teams that we might be

277
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,800
privileged to lead even if we're just

278
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,079
leading ourselves

279
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,720
how can we make it be easier for folks

280
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,839
to understand the why behind the what of

281
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,620
what we have done so what could be the

282
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,820
wisdom in this first step might be

283
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,500
what if you looked at your job

284
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,540
descriptions

285
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,279
what if you look at your mission

286
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,079
statement what if you said you know what

287
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,300
my homework if I don't have the power

288
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,980
but if you were to like write down I'm

289
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,240
going to go figure out the mission of my

290
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,160
company and make it easier to

291
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,959
communicate why you're doing the things

292
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
that you're doing and how it connects

293
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,459
how you're being bilingual speaking

294
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,800
cyber and speaking business

295
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,959
what if your job description had

296
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,519
something about that like if it we

297
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,820
worked at Ted if somehow maybe it led

298
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,459
off with I'm going to do these cyber

299
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,560
things because

300
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,260
Ted the company exists because two words

301
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,819
they want to spread ideas

302
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,880
what if your job annual performance

303
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,140
review like when you have that

304
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,060
uncomfortable conversation with your

305
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,040
boss Your Leader your manager your

306
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,959
supervisor at the end of the year where

307
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,019
they kind of evaluate how'd you do and

308
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,720
for a lot of us

309
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,420
the percentage of your annual bonus or

310
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,339
your raise or your incentives or

311
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,740
whatever financial compensation depends

312
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,680
on how well we did our job

313
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,880
what if we were incentivized

314
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,920
to help people see how the things that

315
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,740
we're doing help at Ted the company

316
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,440
better spread ideas

317
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,779
what if it we were rewarded or

318
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,760
compensated or incented in some way to

319
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,019
help us communicate and do that there at

320
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,360
Ted the company

321
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,839
how did I help how did you help how did

322
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,899
we help spread ideas and this totally

323
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,540
made up real world example

324
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,740
now

325
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,320
if you choose to do this

326
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,839
I believe that this will only cost you

327
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,079
time and not cost you any money at all

328
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,360
if you spread ideas so the wisdom of the

329
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
step could be if you wanted to be clear

330
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,220
for helping people who don't do what we

331
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,980
do people understand what US people do

332
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,380
perhaps using that language could be

333
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,540
helpful there

334
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,959
so again this idea we could fix or

335
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,139
modify or also or copy paste the words

336
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,700
from our company's Mission and say

337
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,639
here's what I do maybe it's a small

338
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,880
teeny tiny contribution to help show

339
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,680
what you're doing and how it fits into

340
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,440
larger plans of your respective

341
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,660
organization

342
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,639
and again not taking away from anything

343
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,680
all the things that you and the teams

344
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,940
that you lead and things that you've

345
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,440
done and it's not taking away or

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,019
minimizing that at all it's leading with

347
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,519
a language it's leading with a

348
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,700
vocabulary that your leaders can ideally

349
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,339
better understand so

350
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,940
step two uh non-tech non-cyber way to

351
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,880
fix your culture today

352
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,560
is to

353
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,979
do

354
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,300
what I call a calendar audit so raise

355
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,760
your hand if your calendars look like my

356
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,820
calendar before yeah how many what's the

357
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,440
most number of meetings you've had at

358
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,700
the same time on your calendar anybody

359
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,720
had two two three

360
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,480
97 meetings at the same okay so clearly

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
you win I I was thinking like two three

362
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,740
four five ninety seven

363
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,079
wow

364
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,959
97 things so I thought I had problems

365
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,399
wow that's uh that's impressive

366
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,220
what I found is it's very easy to be

367
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,480
busy

368
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,980
like it you don't do anything you can be

369
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,959
busy like very very easy meetings come

370
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,940
in you get on committees you get on work

371
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,160
streams you get on work groups your

372
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,339
calendar can look like this or worse

373
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,459
without having to do a whole lot of work

374
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,019
it's really easy

375
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,320
to be busy what's hard

376
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,300
is to work on things that matter the

377
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
most when I was at I was a CIO and CIO

378
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,959
so at the Atlanta fed

379
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,459
at the beginning of the year my boss the

380
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,500
second in command gave me a list of

381
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,240
things he said to me here's the things

382
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
that you're going to do get done through

383
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
others all the things you're going to do

384
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,639
and you've got some portion of the year

385
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,160
to get that done and I've been around

386
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,420
I've been working long enough to know

387
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,120
that at the end of the year that same

388
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,160
boss would evaluate how well did I do

389
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,620
the things that he in that case told me

390
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,360
to do

391
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,620
and I thought you know how could I

392
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,260
position myself for success

393
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,300
I decided what I didn't want to do is

394
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,279
have a conversation with my boss that

395
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,660
says hey

396
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,220
you might not have done the math you

397
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,079
might not have looked at my calendar but

398
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,279
I just want you to know at the end of

399
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,680
the year this whole year my highlight

400
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,480
for my years I went to four thousand

401
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,660
three hundred and twenty one meetings

402
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,399
isn't that why you hired me that you

403
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,899
wanted me to go to those meetings

404
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,639
because I didn't have to do anything I

405
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,500
just had to click keep on clicking the

406
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,920
accept button yep yep yep yep yep yep

407
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
and if I did nothing

408
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,660
I was going to be set up for failure

409
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,019
instead of set up for success

410
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,899
so I thought hmm

411
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,660
I've got attention I want to go to the

412
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,160
meetings I want to maybe see some

413
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,399
colleagues or get an update on a status

414
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,560
but if not careful

415
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,000
and honestly

416
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
if you're not careful

417
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,060
you're not going to be set up for

418
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,800
success

419
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,120
at all

420
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,920
you're not going to be set up for

421
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,620
success I want to get some stuff done

422
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,779
GSD I want to be able to get stuff done

423
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,839
how can I get stuff done

424
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,240
hmm

425
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,940
so when I was privileged to be there the

426
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,060
CIO of the fed the Atlanta fed

427
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,740
called everyone together I only did that

428
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,540
occasionally everyone again everyone

429
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,240
else privileged to lead okay hey I want

430
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,980
to give you permission let's try and

431
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,280
experiment and this experiment was

432
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,640
every time you get a new meeting invite

433
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,020
hey come to this meeting we'll meet

434
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,000
every Wednesday at noon for whatever

435
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,699
important reason is there if there's not

436
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,059
an agenda you have my permission to say

437
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,380
no

438
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,559
and there's like gasp in the room huh

439
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,760
wait you can do that you can say no I

440
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,799
thought there was just a click the

441
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
accept to move on because I got emails

442
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,460
coming in all the time and wait you can

443
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,080
do that

444
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,600
and I said yes and to make it better

445
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,720
you can click no and you can blame me

446
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,700
like if you want to type my boss told me

447
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,000
that I could say no blame me I'm totally

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,140
okay with it

449
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,120
now the neat thing was I didn't go to my

450
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,640
boss and say hey boss I want to do this

451
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
experiment for hundreds of folks I was

452
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,780
privileged to lead but instead

453
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,020
I kind of just did it

454
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,299
well it was fascinating was my never got

455
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,260
in trouble

456
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,900
and once every few weeks

457
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,580
someone I was privileged to leave they

458
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,860
come up to me and smile really big

459
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,000
I got some time back

460
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,260
I'm actually getting some work done and

461
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,059
my work is not going to all those

462
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,299
millions and millions of meetings

463
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,240
and somehow progress

464
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,480
continued to happen and for folks some

465
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,460
of the folks who are like I'm not sure I

466
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,020
believe you and all these things I said

467
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,299
well hey maybe you can reply tentative

468
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,039
there's another button that may be not

469
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,419
used as all when and your meeting

470
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,400
invites come through I get a tentative

471
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,240
me and what is it that you need from me

472
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,580
how specifically do you looking for my

473
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
contribution at this meeting before I go

474
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,080
in and say yes I'll go and contribute in

475
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,580
this way because of having that clarity

476
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,280
and another hack

477
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,220
if you use iCal on the Mac which what

478
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,460
I've got or maybe use Microsoft Outlook

479
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,440
when you set up a meeting what time does

480
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,419
meeting always start

481
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,660
it kind of starts at the top of the hour

482
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,640
and the default meeting typically is an

483
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,020
hour long so you're like wow that's a

484
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,280
very expensive

485
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,140
I've got an idea

486
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,940
so if you if you could help me with this

487
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,679
idea we can go in business we go on

488
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,539
Shark Tank we can be rich I've got this

489
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,760
idea that when you click on a meeting it

490
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,799
says I want to invite all these people

491
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,539
and you just imagine that everyone makes

492
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,220
a hundred dollars an hour and I know not

493
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,840
everyone does

494
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,059
but if you for math purposes 10 people

495
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,700
times 100 an hour there's a financial

496
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,160
cost of the meeting and before you can

497
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,260
click Send if there was a little pop-up

498
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,820
window and nobody likes pop-up windows

499
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,559
but if a pop-up window came up and said

500
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,200
here's the expense of this meeting are

501
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
you sure you're gonna pinky swear that

502
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,740
you're going to expect to get that much

503
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,120
value out of the meeting before you

504
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,940
click Send it seems like financially

505
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,760
There's an opportunity let me know my

506
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,200
contact information is coming up at the

507
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,480
end I think we can do a lot of good but

508
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,820
what if before you make that and we go

509
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,080
on to Shark Tank and make a lot of money

510
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,720
what if you did a little hack

511
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,980
what if you introduced a constraint

512
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,419
that says you know what if I have back

513
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,919
to back to back to back to back meetings

514
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,260
or Bunches of meetings I literally can't

515
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,840
go from one building to another from one

516
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480
office to another unless I introduce a

517
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
constraint

518
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
hmm what would it look like to have the

519
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
constraint of being able to have a

520
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,380
little bit less time stand out and

521
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,140
actually get some other stuff done

522
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,419
and my anti-meeting do I just hate me

523
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,400
some meetings are necessary some are

524
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,679
important I'm not saying don't ever have

525
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,480
a meeting I'm thinking of from a

526
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
financial stewardship perspective as a

527
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,780
way to stand out

528
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,640
so a lot of folks aren't doing things

529
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,220
like this we'd have the opportunity

530
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,000
to be really good stewards when I was

531
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
commuting traffic in Atlanta is just

532
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,620
terrible terrible terrible

533
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,080
live 25 miles away from the office which

534
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,059
means about an hour in each Direction

535
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,039
sometimes even more

536
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,679
something I decided I would do is what

537
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,799
are three things that only I as the

538
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,539
leader could do that's not saying I'm

539
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,640
better not saying none of those things

540
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,440
it's just saying some things if I didn't

541
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,940
do them they just didn't get done maybe

542
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,340
approving someone's promotion letting

543
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,559
them go to training whatever it might be

544
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,260
but this idea of assigning myself some

545
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,320
things to hold myself responsible for

546
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,080
the the duties that I had and then on

547
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,880
the way home

548
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,580
thing number one thing number two things

549
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,960
on the occasion where I did all three I

550
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
would like really be happy with myself

551
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,020
and say that's awesome great great great

552
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,240
it's good to do that

553
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,659
but this idea of how can I look for ways

554
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,240
and look for things that only I could do

555
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,460
to recognize that some things just

556
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,520
required that to be done and so the

557
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,500
wisdom to that is

558
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,360
it's really easy

559
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,059
like super easy to be busy

560
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,000
it's really hard it's very difficult to

561
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,440
say what are the things that matter the

562
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,120
most what are some of the things that

563
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,520
only I and you and we can do

564
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,039
and how can we intentionally focus on

565
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,200
just doing those things

566
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,940
before

567
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,980
doing other things what are some things

568
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,400
that only we can do

569
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,020
so thing number three lesson number

570
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,220
three is

571
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,220
and ways to fix your culture today think

572
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,580
about this idea of free fuel free fuel

573
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,500
so we all care about the environment in

574
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,120
fact I rented a car to drive from

575
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,520
Atlanta to here uh and it's actually a

576
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,080
hybrid I've never driven a hybrid until

577
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,460
like right now I thought oh this is kind

578
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,080
of neat it's kind of like driving a golf

579
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,440
cart but not uh very entertaining I'm

580
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,820
like maybe we should have one of these

581
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,620
so we care about that because we care

582
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,240
about the world and our environment and

583
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,400
the place that we live and we worry

584
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,860
about this quite a bit and we think

585
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,679
eventually you know the cost the expense

586
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,559
of putting fuel in our vehicles like

587
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,120
that really adds up

588
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,159
thinking

589
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,640
is there a way to think about that and

590
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,100
how we lead and how we show up what if

591
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,419
we talked about

592
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,299
not battery power cars and hybrid power

593
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,419
cars and gasoline or diesel powered cars

594
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,220
but what have we thought about fuel a

595
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,140
little bit differently

596
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,320
any fans of Disney

597
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,820
besides me

598
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,740
a couple of you yeah

599
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,860
so the former EVP of Disney Lee Cockrell

600
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,179
wrote this book in his book he talked

601
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,340
about this concept of what would it look

602
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,320
like

603
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,539
to burn free fuel

604
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,980
last time I filled up with gas it was

605
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,299
not it was like the opposite of free

606
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,940
price has just been what they are but he

607
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,559
talks about it in a different way and

608
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,200
this formula of A and R and E what it

609
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,320
would look like if we thought about

610
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,480
appreciation

611
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,159
recognition

612
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,500
and encouragement again whether we're

613
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,360
privileged to lead very large teams

614
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,340
we're leading ourselves being a part of

615
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,780
the team what would it look like if we

616
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,260
focus just a little bit of time maybe a

617
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,539
little bit time every day by recognizing

618
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,460
and appreciating encouraging those that

619
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,400
were privileged to work with what if

620
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,900
instead of trying to catch people doing

621
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,720
something wrong by clicking on a link or

622
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,460
not patching their things or not going

623
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,740
to secure coding class or whatever those

624
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,780
things are that we want folks in our

625
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,400
organization to do what if we focused

626
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,720
instead

627
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,539
hey I saw what you did

628
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,280
and like it was a really good thing it

629
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,559
was really powerful thing catching folks

630
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,360
trying to do something

631
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,880
good and that's what I did when I was at

632
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,260
the FED I would have on my calendar

633
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,659
whenever I was in the office first 30

634
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,620
minutes I would get a coffee cup

635
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,179
and I'd fill it up with coffee and walk

636
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,260
around

637
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,520
how are you doing what are you working

638
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,919
on how's it going did you watch the game

639
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,659
how's the family how's the things you're

640
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,880
working on and what was I doing trying

641
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,740
to be nosy into their business to

642
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,720
Disturbed it no

643
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,020
my thought process was

644
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,360
what if they needed help

645
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,760
understanding why policy was in place or

646
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,799
why we were focused on a particular item

647
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,140
or an initiative or an objective or

648
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,539
maybe they need someone to click an

649
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,299
approve button or ask questions or I

650
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,440
didn't really understand that last all

651
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,760
hands meeting where you said I didn't

652
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,700
have to go to meetings seriously

653
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,320
you

654
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,940
you're going to cover that you got me

655
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,080
covered

656
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,940
what if we put ourselves in this

657
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,760
position to be able to listen and learn

658
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,980
and be able to put ourselves in a

659
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,159
position to be available

660
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,140
especially for those of you who've been

661
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,419
at your organization for a long time you

662
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,559
just know stuff

663
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,299
you know how to get things done you know

664
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,900
how business is done new people

665
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,740
find new guys and find new gals FNG the

666
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,320
new people who aren't able is easy to

667
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,299
navigate

668
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,000
what questions do they have what

669
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,620
questions did you have

670
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,320
the two the you from two years ago the

671
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,760
things you didn't quite understand the

672
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,140
things that word didn't quite make sense

673
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,779
are there opportunities to loan the

674
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,279
resource of you

675
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,740
for the benefit of them and perhaps

676
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,039
doing that on purpose so the wisdom in

677
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,440
that step where possible a-r-e

678
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,059
appreciation recognition and

679
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,820
encouragement burn the free fuel to help

680
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,059
your teams be successful

681
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,039
last one the bonus one and I'll go

682
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,960
quickly on this my time is about out

683
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,299
this idea to have

684
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,220
what would it look like to have a big

685
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,919
impact on the culture of the company

686
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:47,940
that you're at right now the

687
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,860
organization that you're part of like

688
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,200
really really big part of the culture

689
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,159
um

690
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,260
and and this is it

691
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,440
we talk about culture a lot hey those I

692
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,820
hate saying this for the record it's

693
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,860
it's going to make me painful to say

694
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,940
this but I'm going to say this for the

695
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,400
lesson hey those stupid users why do

696
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,620
they keep clicking on those links I

697
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,659
won't I say raise your hand I've been

698
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,860
guilty of saying that some of you are

699
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,299
giggling you've said it again I'm not

700
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,860
trying to call you

701
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,220
it's easy to say those things because

702
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,500
we've got Insider information we know

703
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,480
how that works we know not to click on

704
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,940
things we know the risks that happen

705
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,980
but instead of

706
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,080
trying to get everyone to think like us

707
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,720
and be like us and do like us

708
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,640
begin with the example of Ted that

709
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,320
exists for two reasons and neither one

710
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,480
of those words that are cyber

711
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,340
spread ideas

712
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,740
what if we Instead try to mold the

713
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,480
culture of the team that we're on to

714
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,159
better meet the needs of companies like

715
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,980
Ted who's got reasons to exist like to

716
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,200
spread ideas

717
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,179
what if we're the one agents of change

718
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,039
instead of waiting on everyone to

719
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
understand all the Cyber and Technical

720
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,580
and I.T things

721
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,220
that we do what do I know I know that

722
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,039
when we do that

723
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,620
you'll be glad that you did so the

724
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,559
wisdom in that step or the the CTA

725
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,659
anyone from Chicago

726
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,919
no money okay uh one so the not that CTA

727
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,039
though the call to action uh is what I

728
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,159
hope that you choose to do is to

729
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,140
go to your calendar

730
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,240
and on your calendar make a recurring

731
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,500
reminder

732
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,360
that says

733
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,480
every Friday at noon

734
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,340
or every Tuesday at three or every

735
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,320
Monday at four whenever you got margin

736
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,659
in your calendar right now

737
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,299
I invite you to make a weekly recurring

738
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,400
reminder to consider doing one or two or

739
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,500
