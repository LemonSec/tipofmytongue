32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
name is Adrian a very similar background

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
West Point Computer Science very excited

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,820
about backtrack when it first came out

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,920
and introduced medicine point to this

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,320
young man when he was a young shining

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,500
buck and these days since I got out of

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,759
the army after doing infantry and

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,340
Special Forces stuff I was a government

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,740
contractor writing uh offensive security

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,939
software

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,100
and then built my own company doing

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,020
cyber security Consulting and v-sizo

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,320
stuff and then most recently that

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,540
company was acquired and now I am the

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,100
Cyber practice lead at a place called

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,040
resource of who helps basically take

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,140
that same experience and help you build

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,700
cyber cyber programs for the companies

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
because I think everyone in this room

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
can agree that it's actually really hard

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
so if you do happen to see Sean please

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,479
pack a limb because out of the three of

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,920
us he's the only one that hasn't sold a

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,399
company yet

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,180
so case study

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,098
Adrian and I get to come in and talk

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,800
with clients all over the world all the

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,020
time from every vertical to every

60
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,940
location whether it's financial services

61
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,700
companies Consulting companies oil and

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,680
gas companies you name the company or

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,379
the level small on mid-sized business to

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,780
mid-market to Enterprise and when we

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,000
come in we get to try to help them build

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,040
their security postures go find the

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,480
vendors that can actually solve their

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,340
problems so the case study that we're

69
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,319
looking at right now is one that we see

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,060
all the time and both of us know this

71
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,140
company because we're actually Channel

72
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,000
Partners we get to work together and

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
work on the same problems so the drive

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,959
into Augusta yesterday we drove together

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
we worked on a presentation on probably

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
less than we should have because we were

77
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,300
working on clients so this is one of

78
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,400
those clients Adrian who who is this

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,780
client what do they do yeah so we're

80
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,640
going to be as Anonymous as possible but

81
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
everybody keep this as part of the

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
introduction to how we'll frame the rest

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,340
of the conversation so let's just say

84
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,099
that somewhere out there across the

85
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,660
country there's a small business who

86
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,360
needs assistance in some way with like

87
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,580
operations payroll et cetera et cetera

88
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,560
right so let's say that a different

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
company this our actual case study

90
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
company has built this awesome system

91
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,620
and they're going to help train

92
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,080
Affiliates that will go out and bring

93
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,900
this new capability to those local

94
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,519
businesses so there's like a commission

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
system and everything and they've got

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
everything built out they've built all

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
their in-house Dev teams so no real

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,580
contractor base but they do it all

99
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,459
hiring W-2 and they have all the

100
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,200
capabilities that you would expect from

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
like startup mid-market where you're

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,860
doing business development market

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,239
research and kind of have all that

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,260
broken out so really quickly uh

105
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,580
it's

106
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,920
a little bit important to talk about the

107
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,540
background of this because they're

108
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,000
rapidly growing worldwide right so there

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,379
is some they're seen as the market

110
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,840
leader there is some huge publicity both

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,900
in the United States and in Europe uh

112
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,299
last year it's estimated because we only

113
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,860
do estimations because we can't talk

114
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,360
about private companies and Insider

115
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,519
knowledge is but they did about 180

116
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,439
million in Revenue and with only about

117
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,360
six million dollars in operating costs

118
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,400
and that's a pretty amazing

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,798
profit margin right so if you were

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,260
called to evaluate this company for some

121
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,899
type of investment or public offering

122
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,460
and you were part of the company that's

123
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,080
got to come in and do some type of

124
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,060
assessment uh where would you start

125
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,280
audience participation just shouted out

126
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,820
anyone

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
asset inventory thank you what was CIS

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
control one asset inventory right there

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,660
there you go any others

130
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,880
all right so let's let's keep this case

131
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,860
study just in mind as we move forward

132
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,320
right because this organization is going

133
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
to come back to play later

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,479
so what we're talking about today

135
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,759
the first step is know your enemy and

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,080
that means we obviously need a Sun Zoo

137
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,300
quote we'll get to that in a second but

138
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,440
then we'll look at some actual

139
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,780
ransomware notes from Conti

140
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,460
we'll take a look at Conti's business

141
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,080
model because this talk is the business

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
of ransomware and of course the actions

143
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,580
on the objective what do you do when you

144
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,320
get the call

145
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,080
when you get the call

146
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,540
hey we're under attack what do we do

147
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,940
because everyone in here will at some

148
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,639
point get the call and it'll be your job

149
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
to respond to stand up and to help lead

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
either your company or a partner company

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,020
through a time of duress so what do you

152
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,580
do let's answer that

153
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,560
so back to Sun Tzu this is the original

154
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
Mandarin as far as I can tell and it

155
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,660
effectively says if you know your enemy

156
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,639
and you know yourself

157
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,979
you need not fear the outcome of a

158
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,320
hundred battles

159
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
so that means we'll build a table

160
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,919
because that's what we do right

161
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,300
if you know yourself and you know your

162
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,520
enemies you're invincible

163
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,199
if you know yourself and you don't know

164
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,419
your enemies you got a 50 50 shot of

165
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,380
winning

166
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,479
and if you don't know yourself and you

167
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,699
don't know your enemies You're Dead on

168
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,380
Arrival

169
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,060
so for those of you that are of the

170
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,680
older generation you remember Rocky IV

171
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,300
he puts Drago's picture on the mirror

172
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,440
and looks at every day when he brushes

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,380
his teeth we're gonna do the same thing

174
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,880
threatened formed intelligence

175
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,740
absolutely understand your enemy and I

176
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,120
can tell you and I know Adrian can as

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,699
well many times when we show up to an

178
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,500
organization and we start asking them

179
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,000
about their posture where are you at

180
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,919
what are your goals what's your vision

181
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,660
for security how does security enable

182
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,479
your company to go to market and win

183
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,060
they don't know what they have they fail

184
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,020
at CIS control one of inventory

185
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,419
so how can they possibly become

186
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,400
invincible if they don't know their

187
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,780
adversaries they don't know their

188
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,400
enemies and they don't know themselves

189
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,979
so 2022 Verizon dbir the data breach

190
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,100
investigation report phenomenal output

191
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,720
for anybody that's in here that has not

192
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,060
read any of the dbirs strongly recommend

193
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,520
go read them pull them up they're

194
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,660
written for executives which means

195
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,620
they're written for kindergartners so

196
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,419
they're really easy to read

197
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,440
so when we look at them

198
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,600
why do breaches happen what are the

199
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
motivations behind the actors that are

200
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,300
actually conducting breaches 88 of all

201
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,759
breaches that Verizon looked at were

202
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,340
motivated financially

203
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,220
for dollars

204
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,919
eleven percent were from Espionage so

205
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,479
for this group

206
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,680
you're probably going to look at that

207
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
quite a lot as well

208
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,860
but for outside in the commercial space

209
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,259
88 is financial and then there's some

210
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,460
other things that go in there so

211
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,800
obviously if 88 is financial that's

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
where we're going to look right now and

213
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,280
who better to look at than kante

214
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,620
so here's the fear

215
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,060
I know Adrian's gotten this call many

216
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,160
times I've gotten this call as well

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,259
the cios in the room the directors in

218
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,699
this room have gotten this call

219
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,620
you're sitting in traffic you're driving

220
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,139
and your phone rings so since you're a

221
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,819
good participant you keep one hand of

222
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,620
the wheel and you swipe and you answer

223
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,300
and you can hear someone's voice

224
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,419
trembling on the other side of the phone

225
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,580
as you imagine them you can see them

226
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,599
shaking

227
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,039
because of how much their voice is

228
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,060
scrambling

229
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,520
and they can't even describe to you what

230
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
they're seeing what's happening at the

231
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,099
company

232
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,080
and eventually they say just open your

233
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,000
messages and look at the picture

234
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,979
so you pull over you hear the sound of

235
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,419
gravel underneath your tires on the side

236
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,280
of the road and you pull up the picture

237
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,199
that they just sent you and it's a

238
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,960
picture of a locked desktop

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,240
it's a picture of an actual Conti Ransom

240
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,919
note that they just sent you thank you

241
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,199
to sentinelabs for providing this let's

242
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,760
jump into the actual con uh the actual

243
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,640
ransomware note all of your files are

244
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,458
currently encrypted by Conti strain as

245
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,640
you know if you don't just Google it

246
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
all of the data that's been encrypted by

247
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,480
our software cannot be recovered by any

248
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,820
means without contacting our team

249
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,019
directly

250
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,120
if you try to use any additional

251
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
recovery software the files might be

252
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,620
damaged so if you're willing to try go

253
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,540
ahead and try it on some data of the

254
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,040
lowest value

255
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,160
make to make sure that we really can

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,140
get your data back we offer to decrypt

258
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:07,980
charge

259
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,720

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,820
of your internal data and we're ready to

265

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,940
do not respond

267
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,500
so it'll be better for both sides if you

268
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,200
just contact us as soon as possible

269
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,060
now that's a sales note if I've ever

270
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,920
seen one

271
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,620
hey look you're a proof of value we'll

272
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,060
give you two files for free to prove

273
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,100
that we're honorable thieves and then oh

274
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,120
by the way we've got to help desk

275
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,500
because we really want to support you

276
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,220
through this process

277
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
so let's peek behind the curtains

278
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,760
how do we know this information in 2021

279
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,100
a disgruntled employee a disgruntled

280
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,500
County affiliate leaked the gang's whole

281
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,360
Playbook

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,180
the whole Playbook translated from

283
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,339
Russian into English it's out you can

284
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,320
just go download it it's their entire

285
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,300
play-by-play Playbook

286
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,680
all of it

287
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
easy we can read it now now we know it

288
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,839
it's not us sitting in a room thinking

289
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,399
about how it's happening it's not the

290
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,420
cuckoo egg it is actual how they operate

291
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,459
and then oh by the way after Russia

292
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,320
invaded Ukraine

293
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,980
um

294
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,660
kind of a bad leadership decision in my

295
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,420
my opinion like hey if uh we're gonna go

296
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,339
align with Russia and a bunch of our

297
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,720
devs are in Ukraine we're kind of

298
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
pissing off our employee base

299
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,440
maybe we shouldn't do that but they did

300
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
uh Conti came out and pledged support

301
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
for Russia and then the Ukrainian side

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,820
of the house said that's not cool screw

303
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
you boss and they leaked 170 internal

304
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,980
chat messages out to the internet

305
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,080
and all of those have been translated to

306
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
English as well

307
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,560
so this isn't theoretical this is

308
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,660
operational it's actually what happened

309
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,760
and you can go read it too because it's

310
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
there

311
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
the links are in the Articles all you

312
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,399
got to do is go take a look at them so

313
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,240
who are they as we look at the

314
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
ransomware market itself

315
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
we've got our professional criminals and

316
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,060
we've got our state-sponsored criminals

317
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,640
professional criminals lockbit owns 38

318
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,459
of the market of ransomware

319
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,980
but they haven't had 170 000 articles

320
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,160
leaked so we'll come back to them Conte

321
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,779
owns 20 of the market they're the second

322
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,220
biggest market share owner of the

323
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,740
ransomware market and we happen to have

324
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,420
a ton of their data so it's ripe for

325
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,700
picking you also see reveal And Hive and

326
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,440
then of course state sponsored which as

327
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,940
far as we know Conte is not necessarily

328
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,120
attached with Lazarus black shadow these

329
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,440
two sorry groups are also really

330
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,720
interesting because they target their

331
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,760
own people in order to generate the

332
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,940
revenue to continue to operate

333
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,820
they eat their young very nice very nice

334
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,120
yeah so we're going to look at Conti

335
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,680
and we're going to look at initially

336
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,920
whom not what or how this is a Microsoft

337
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,660
publication that looks at the healthcare

338
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,700
industry some of the larger threat

339
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,260
groups that Target the threat industry

340
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,060
we will come back to RDP Brute Force I

341
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,019
promise

342
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,079
but first we're going to look at whom

343
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,880
so they have an ecosystem

344
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,980
Adrian tell me about the ecosystem so

345
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,339
this is one of the greatest decisions

346
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,140
that they've probably made and the

347
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,240
differentiator that separates them from

348
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
someone sitting in their basement in

349
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,540
their hoodie which I actually enjoy in

350
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,420
my basement my hoodie and separates them

351
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,339
into like an actual Professional

352
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,260
Organization

353
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,740
they have separate companies that

354
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,079
they're enabling you can see Conti all

355
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,339
the way up in the top right as the

356
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,560
actual operator right but as you start

357
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
looking at the left it's a separate

358
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,820
business entirely an initial access

359
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,000
broker all they're doing these this

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,040
organization is going out and trying to

361
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,139
find some foothold doesn't matter what

362
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,839
it is they can use RDP scanning and try

363
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,399
to look for something compromised they

364
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,079
can try to buy some credentials off the

365
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
dark web maybe for your organization

366
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,860
maybe for like a third party organ like

367
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,899
a third uh like a supply chain type

368
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,519
organization maybe someone that you've

369
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,839
allowed into your network that you're

370
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,100
not really tracking as well as you

371
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,360
should

372
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
um or just you know pretty much anything

373
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,860
you can imagine right all the fun stuff

374
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,480
they're going to take that information

375
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,459
and that initial access and that

376
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,839
foothold and they're just going to go

377
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,240
right back to the affiliate of Conti

378
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,220
themselves this is the person who is

379
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,579
going to expand that access and start

380
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,899
executing all of the actual like they're

381
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,700
the ones who push the magic button that

382
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,760
says encrypt right so they're the ones

383
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,079
you got to worry about

384
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,600
we bring this up because it's a process

385
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,360
it is a legitimate business transaction

386
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,920
just like

387
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,040
Contracting a separate company to do

388
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,779
some type of initial assessment I don't

389
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,040
know like a pen test or a risk

390
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,600
assessment and then taking that

391
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,279
information and doing something

392
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,740
internally with it deciding and now

393
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,019
actually executing your full roadmap and

394
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,339
your playbooks that you have inside

395
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,740
internal to your organization right so

396
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,420
as they do that they're going to develop

397
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,980
persistence because it hasn't already

398
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,720
been created

399
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,940
but what do developers and these types

400
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,339
of organizations lack the experience in

401
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,800
negotiation maybe the development

402
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,180
experience if they're actually going to

403
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,160
be using I don't know like some type of

404
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,019
exploits to advance their movement

405
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,180
throughout the network all of that is

406
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,260
created by Conti they help negotiate all

407
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,540
the payments so the ransomware is a

408
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,120
service affiliate doesn't have to

409
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,620
they're really taking all of the

410
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,360
strengths of all of their organization

411
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,500
and leveraging that through the

412
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,880
affiliate model and just getting a

413
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,139
commission from everything

414
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,240
it's it's pretty slick

415
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,579
so when I first saw this model I took a

416
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,600
look at it

417
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,180
and I was like yeah that makes sense of

418
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,800
course it makes sense to Outsource to

419
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,760
another partner who's gonna then

420
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,199
Outsource to another partner we see that

421
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,180
all the time we saw that you know in

422
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,980
Army cyber we continue to see it in

423
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,720
corporate environment but as I looked at

424
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,940
this a little bit closer I realized that

425
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,339
this is the channel sales model

426
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,860
this is what we do on a day-to-day basis

427
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,139
through through effectively brokering to

428
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,660
enable companies to come in and win

429
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,940
now the question then becomes if this is

430
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,060
what they do to attack are they better

431
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,220
at it than us

432
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,560
they're definitely more well-funded

433
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,779
are they better at it than us and who is

434
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,000
going to win in this model before you

435
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
before you do it who in here has like a

436
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,880
good percentage for some type of sales

437
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,100
funnel right what's a good conversion

438
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,079
rate anyone

439
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,260
10 okay 10 is pretty damn good if you

440
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,000
have a 10 sales funnel I would like to

441
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,320
hire your organization to build mine

442
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,699
right now anyone else

443
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,500
okay yeah so depending on what you're

444
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,060
selling it can be anywhere between like

445
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,620
one to two is like a good conversion

446
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,899
rate or if you're like doing some type 5

447
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,880
to 10 right so let's

448
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,699
so let's look at their funnel

449
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,500
so Katie will give out a list that says

450
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,980
hey give us 2 000 or I'll give you 2 500

451
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,899
potential Target organizations

452
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,380
2 500 of those the access Brokers will

453
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,639
take a look at it they'll still skim

454
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,500
through the list maybe they'll do a

455
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,180
control F maybe they'll sort

456
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,040
alphabetically they'll pick 60

457
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,680
organizations to actually maybe start to

458
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
Target

459
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,680
out of those 60 organizations they

460
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,079
target they'll successfully compromise

461
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,120
20.

462
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,279
and out of those 20 they hand those off

463
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,940
to conti and Conti says oh great 20.

464
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,680
I'll pick one

465
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
so looking at this from the perspective

466
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,579
of like what is your actual conversion

467
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,560
rate right if you're into sales if

468
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,480
you've done any type of research right

469
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,040
the the top one is like looking at

470
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,899
crunch base it's like looking at

471
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,399
pitchbook right you're just kind of

472
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,540
looking through like who's actually

473
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,459
available we'll try to see like what

474
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,540
companies are out there that might be

475
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,820
great targets or opportunities for us to

476
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,380
reach out and then you start getting

477
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,160
into like 60 organizations actually got

478
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,600
sent emails and out of those 60 emails

479
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,519
20 of them

480
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,699
sent something back saying we would love

481
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,759
to buy your product right now

482
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,139
that's the equivalent of what's

483
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,519
Happening Here

484
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,519
that one that gets compromised isn't the

485
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,619
real Victory because there are 19 other

486
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,959
ones who are banging at the door saying

487
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,540
please take my money I would love to buy

488
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,000
your product

489
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
one third like 33 conversion I think

490
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,439
that's pretty good yep and oh by the way

491
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,240
this is just one org there's all the

492
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,559
competitive all of Conti's competitors

493
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,240
are doing the same thing and they're in

494
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,579
those 26 actual organizations as well so

495
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,980
Conti gets to sit there and go hey who

496
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,199
do I want to give me money today is it

497
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,500
you is it you is it you is it you or is

498
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,679
it you give me money

499
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,200
so let's look at their actual Playbook

500
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
this is the first page of Conti's

501
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,440
Playbook

502
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,200
paragraph 1.1

503
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,840
company Revenue search

504
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,299
Google dork

505
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,419
Google company name plus Revenue

506
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,640
now the interesting thing here is that

507
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,600
says Revenue it doesn't say profit

508
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,460
profit is revenue Minus cost it just

509
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,900
says Revenue

510
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,520
and then they say okay now that you know

511
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,020
the company's Revenue

512
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,580
why don't you go out and take a look and

513
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,559
see what other information you can get

514
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,500
owler Manta Zoom info DNB and Rocket

515
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,320
reach they misspelled rocket reach

516
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,760
so

517
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,740
those are the same tools that your sales

518
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,660
teams are using

519
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,460
the exact same tool so I beg the

520
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,220
question again is your sales team better

521
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,679
than Conti are they using the tools

522
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,380
better than Conti's using the tools and

523
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,600
are you incentivizing them correctly to

524
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,280
go out and help actually protect because

525
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,780
if you truly believe in the product set

526
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,280
that you have the services that you have

527
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
are you doing the right work and going

528
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,600
up against Conti to go protect your

529
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,919
clients or not because everyone in this

530
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,679
room is Mission focused

531
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,539
okay so now that we've gone through this

532
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,900
let's take a quick look at what this

533
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,059
organization looks like right so local

534
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,100
businesses lack refined tools to

535
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,740
actually accomplish their goals uh the

536
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,419
pla there are the platform empowering

537
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,640
local businesses with support software

538
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,400
training maybe a help desk

539
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,299
pricing right who who is this uh this is

540
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,460
actually Conti right so this is not like

541
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,640
some mid-level organization that's built

542
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,679
out their organizational structure based

543
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,179
off you know like mergers and

544
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,120
Acquisitions over time and PE firms and

545
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,380
operating partners coming in and

546
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,440
Advising them no this is like the

547
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,360
criminal organization that is trying to

548
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,679
attack and lock down all of your

549
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,140
networks right now so it's funny because

550
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,360
as we look at it when we go out and talk

551
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,559
to companies like this and help them

552
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,179
with their security pipeline their

553
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,640
programs it is exactly organized the

554
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,500
same as Conti this is Conti's

555
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,120
organizational chart

556
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,100
so let's dive deeper into their org

557
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,660
chart so on the left we'll come back to

558
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,000
r d and HR in just a minute on the right

559
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,980
their business development team this is

560
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,660
where they have actual ransomware

561
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,820
negotiators and we'll give you towards

562
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,500
the end of the talk actual negotiations

563
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,020
a screenshot of negotiations going back

564
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,940
and forth this is where they have their

565
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,980
Acquisitions teams that are going out

566
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,840
and looking for new malware sets or new

567
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,440
C2 Frameworks or other actual pieces of

568
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,200
crypto ransomware they're going out and

569
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,480
acquiring the software and the tools and

570
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,039
other businesses in this space other

571
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,100
Mafia groups that can come in and help

572
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,500
mature their organization Finance you

573
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,880
can't have a criminal Enterprise without

574
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,500
money laundering

575
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,080
so they do of course they do and

576
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,340
transaction management of course we

577
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,360
already talked about their affiliate

578
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,120
groups now let's jump into r d and HR

579
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,020
so as we jump down into it here's their

580
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,120
actual handles

581
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,600
so the top we have the big boss Stern

582
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,039
so Stern when you go through and you

583
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,000
look at his chats of the 170 000 chat

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,280
messages that were leaked

585
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,340
Stern is all over the place

586
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,919
this guy would believe him to be a guy

587
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,740
is out talking with other ransomware

588
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,440
groups all across everywhere potentially

589
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,840
talking to nation state actors talking

590
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
to everyone he understands the market he

591
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,100
sets the vision he sets the revenue

592
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,799
targets Etc the CEO going out and

593
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,299
networking with all the other rest of

594
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,039
the industry yep what do they do they

595
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,900
fight up and out

596
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,419
then we have salamandra in HR

597
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,100
salamander is really interesting because

598
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,400
in HR his job is to go out and identify

599
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,380
more people to come in and do the talent

600
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,539
management piece so he will go post

601
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,520
legitimate job descriptions on

602
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,580
legitimate websites do legitimate

603
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,320
interviews and then eventually pivot to

604
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,120
the dark side when he thinks he's found

605
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,260
the right person in order to bring them

606
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,919
in the organization

607
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,600
um once he does have someone if they

608
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
don't have quite the right skill set but

609
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,620
they've got right the mentality

610
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,299
obviously you got to train them up right

611
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,760
so he hands them off over to Twin on the

612
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,980
training organization who trains them

613
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,539
puts them through an actual training

614
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,679
pipeline

615
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,179
and then once twin puts them through the

616
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,280
training pipeline he hands them off to

617
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,980
either a team B team or C team

618
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,200
so if you look here you'll see that a

619
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,480
team has one leader and B team and C

620
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,159
team both have two

621
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,440
because they're these orgs independently

622
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,820
these units are large enough that they

623
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,400
probably need two liters but Rosetta is

624
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,740
kind of a jerk

625
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,640
huge ego

626
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,980
and honestly not a boss that I want to

627
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,299
work for but then again it's the mafia

628
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,799
so who you're going to complain to not

629
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,020
salamandra

630
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,820
um and then underneath of them they've

631
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,380
got their own Developers

632
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,000
they each have their own pen testing

633
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,039
Crews they each have their own ocent

634
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,039
teams their own admins and here's the

635
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,140
part that I find really interesting they

636
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,659
all have their own QA

637
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,480
they've got really strong QA because

638
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,039
they want to make sure that if they

639
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,980
encrypt you and then you pay them that

640
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,940
they're actually going to give you a

641
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,200
decryption key

642
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,240
and it's going to work the nerd inside

643
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,039
me wants to look at their CI CD Pipeline

644
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,780
and just kind of see how bad their unit

645
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,580
tests are because I have to imagine they

646
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,280
can't be that good but good enough to

647
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,740
work and of course reverse Engineers now

648
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,179
we haven't talked about blockchain with

649
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,559
Colin yet

650
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,980
um or the blog with bio so Colin

651
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,539
basically runs all the crypto ransomware

652
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,919
development itself so the encryption

653
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,419
keys that they're running back and forth

654
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,820
that the dev teams use in their CI CD

655
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,559
pipeline to go out and deploy so he's

656
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,419
very focused smaller team

657
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,039
blog

658
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,380
with bio bio runs the blog they call it

659
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,240
blog internally but this is their

660
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,760
marketing arm

661
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,860
this is where they go through and when

662
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,559
they do extract data they publish it out

663
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,179
to the internet

664
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,659
uh this is where anytime that you see a

665
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,820
contia Rebrand Kanti shut down they did

666
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,799
a thing they retired

667
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,500
bio does all that marketing

668
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,940
and then they Rebrand to something else

669
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,679
and they stand up again and they do or

670
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,200
they pivot or they do a divestiture or

671
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,340
maybe they go acquire somebody now

672
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,240
they're calling themselves something

673
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,620
else

674
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,140
bio runs all of that Wicked smart on

675
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,940
marketing so any I know we're talking to

676
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,140
mostly Engineers don't hate your

677
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,000
marketing team they do good work

678
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,700
they keep you employed actually

679
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,039
so who's a Target

680
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,820
if you have Revenue you are a Target

681
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,120
this is not about targeting a specific

682
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,460
company because it's some political act

683
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,640
right it was we go back to that

684
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,159
reasoning for ransomware attacks

685
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,340
88 are all just financially motivated

686
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,200
you're not special

687
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,059
I hate to say it I know you love your

688
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,419
company but you're not really that cool

689
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,640
if you make revenue and you have some

690
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,539
misconfiguration in something right who

691
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,400
in this room is a hundred percent

692
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,760
certain that their organization is a

693
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,620
hundred percent free of all

694
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,960
misconfigurations on any public-facing

695
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,039
nodes

696
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,780
anyone

697
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,520
great I do not have to buy anybody a

698
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,260
beer that would be the first time out of

699
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,460
all the time to done this that someone

700
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,840
actually raised their hand we got

701
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,340
there's actually I like the big Chuckles

702
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,260
in the back but that's why you have to

703
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,260
prepare that's why you build your

704
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,960
security program because if you have

705
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,000
Revenue you are now a Target

706
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,559
so who's actually getting hit who are

707
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,299
the targets by the market

708
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,980
as we look at it we'll start off with a

709
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,780
big orange one Healthcare so if you go

710
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,100
read the reports the industry reports

711
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,659
like the dbir

712
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,080
Health Care you see huge expansions in

713
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,820
the healthcare space but there's

714
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,960
something that you've also see in

715
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,460
healthcare where you see the highest

716
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,559
percentage of Security leaders in

717
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,779
healthcare saying we believe that we are

718
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,020
good

719
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,120
that tells me that the ego inside of

720
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,919
Health Care is higher than the actual

721
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,380
performance and ability

722
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,460
which we'll get into in a couple minutes

723
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,080
uh media and entertainment who remembers

724
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,419
the Sony breach yeah huge right so that

725
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,980
hasn't gone down

726
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,539
um again thank your marketing teams for

727
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,460
giving you a job

728
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,320
um energy we're going to see energy

729
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,179
continuing to go up we're starting to

730
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,620
see new policy and regulations coming

731
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,720
out all over the world that are driving

732
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,460
things to like you know Continue to

733
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,860
update the iot and scada devices that

734
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,120
are part of your delivery and energy

735
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,559
systems

736
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,659
um but they're also we know that they're

737
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,100
weak and the bad guys know that they're

738
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,480
weak and it's a play they know they

739
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,100
can't do too much in oil gas and energy

740
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,840
because then they'll start having five

741
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
eyes Partners come after them so they

742
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
just have this little heartbeat that

743
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,520
goes back and forth

744
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,100
now Financial was going down

745
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Financial was going down because the

746
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,960
finance industry is ahead of the game

747
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,779
and they're mandated like by law to be

748
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,460
profitable so they've got the dollars to

749
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,960
invest in security

750
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,179
Etc and they don't want to go to prison

751
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,559
so they were going down why it's going

752
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,520
back up again is because of

753
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,039
cryptocurrency exchanges

754
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,380
because the crypto might be damn good

755
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,720
but if the exchange security sucks the

756
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,740
crypto doesn't matter

757
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,179
place your money accordingly this is not

758
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,700
this is not legal advice

759
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,659
um the other thing I want to highlight

760
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,279
in this one is that sliver the kind of

761
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,620
the brown sliver higher education

762
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,520
specifically because we're in a higher

763
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,500
education institution right now

764
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,020
when we look at higher ed

765
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,940
bad guys can wait as long as they want

766
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,740
because there's only two weeks a year

767
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,020
that are important to higher ed one is

768
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,720
in the fall and one is in the spring

769
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,440
finals week

770
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,140
universities get hit during finals week

771
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,179
so if universities get hit during finals

772
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,679
week you know they're going to pay

773
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,360
because they have a responsibility to

774
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,460
their students who are paying a ton of

775
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,500
money to go to school so they're going

776
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,000
to pay the ransom and we're seeing

777
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
institutions close their doors that have

778
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
been open for a hundred years because

779
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,179
they didn't invest into security I'm not

780
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,679
telling them to go spend hundreds and

781
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,880
thousands or millions of dollars in

782
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,400
security what I am saying is Advocate to

783
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,220
build the right Security Programs idprr

784
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,440
I think we all know that there are steps

785
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,179
that you can take in your organization

786
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,460
that are Baseline steps that cost very

787
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,620
little money right just segmenting your

788
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,299
network is appropriate actually having

789
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,520
role-based controls and like leveraging

790
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,260
any type of multi-factor authentication

791
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,279
in your existing systems doesn't matter

792
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,980
what they are just doing some basic

793
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,919
stuff can reduce that East-West movement

794
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,539
once they make their initial footprint

795
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,039
right and that kind of comes back to the

796
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,600
hiring and talent piece as well so

797
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,279
obviously sponsored by security Union

798
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,340
Doug Burks great product freeware

799
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,620
Etc almost every bootcamp Camp

800
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,320
insecurity is teaching security Union so

801
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,059
a great great option for everybody in

802
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,380
the room if you're designing a program

803
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,900
design it around the systems that are

804
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,080
both free that you can go just go to a

805
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,520
boot camp and hire people straight out

806
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,900
of because they're already learning the

807
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,640
tools that you use pick the tools that

808
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,620
people are learning and then you've got

809
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,360
a whole Talent Development pipeline you

810
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,799
don't have to go and try to find talent

811
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,020
because they're right there

812
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,179
more on that to come

813
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,500
so let's talk about the Pyramid of pain

814
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,179
there's a couple of them and you've

815
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,260
already seen some today in different

816
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,720
talks the big one is give us dollars

817
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,240
right give us money we ran some of your

818
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,140
stuff

819
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,000
and what we usually see in the news

820
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
media is hey we locked your computers up

821
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
with crypto ransomware give us money

822
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,980
but that's just one piece of extortion

823
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,960
we're seeing double triple quadruple

824
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,960
extortion all across the industry so

825
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,400
it's not just hey we locked your

826
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,500
computers remember the ransomware note

827
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,900
we also extracted your data and if you

828
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,460
don't pay us we're going to leak it out

829
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,700
and everyone will get to see it and it's

830
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,080
if you're if you're a healthcare

831
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,020
organization and you have health like

832
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,120
personal health information the leak of

833
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
that is going to come back and bite you

834
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,659
even more when you start getting

835
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,320
penalized and find and your customers

836
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,279
start going away because their

837
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,700
information is not safe right so

838
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,320
sorry Benji red doesn't even take a

839
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,480
drink Oh no you're good

840
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,320
um

841
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,580
now there's a couple other pieces here

842
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,659
that we're seeing

843
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,179
uh this next one is not specific to

844
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,580
Conti yet that we have seen or that we

845
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,460
know of but if you have access to all

846
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,840
your you know an organization's

847
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,340
computers

848
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,140
and you get access to an executive's

849
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,220
computer and you get access to their

850
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,500
webcam and you can pay somebody a couple

851
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,059
dollars a day to just watch the webcam

852
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,380
footage and see if anything weird

853
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,539
happens and then you can blackmail the

854
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,460
executive as well what better leverage

855
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,980
than hey Company please give us your

856
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,419
money

857
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:07,740
hey we saw what you're doing on your

858
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,360
webcam and you should really approve

859
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,340
that expenditure or we'll release that

860
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,080
too

861
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,640
so we're starting to see that more often

862
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
and then all the way why not kick a dead

863
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,080
horse when it's down right DDOS cheap

864
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,840
fast easy just kick them

865
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,940
hey pay up we're going to shut off your

866
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,200
ability to go to market and make new

867
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,279
Revenue

868
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,419
so

869
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,580
bad guys are smart they're Wily they're

870
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,320
well funded and they just want to take

871
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,520
money they'll do whatever they need to

872
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,980
to get those dollars

873
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,799
great we talked about who let's talk

874
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,320
about how

875
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,360
so initial access Adrian walk me through

876
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,640
initial access let's let's just throw

877
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,440
out the RDP stuff right up right off the

878
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,460
bat right like you probably shouldn't be

879
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,100
running too much RDP especially uh with

880
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,539
like wheat credentials and you know

881
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,919
we'll move on

882
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,720
um but like vulnerable internet-facing

883
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,500
systems how misconfigurations of normal

884
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,600
Services whether that's something that

885
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,860
your Dev team stood up in a test

886
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,600
environment that happens to be publicly

887
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,580
facing that is going to be leveraged to

888
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,299
get through the rest of your

889
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,419
organization or it's like someone in HR

890
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,740
or marketing who's clicking something

891
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,340
that they probably shouldn't I am guilty

892
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,620
at least historically of blaming the

893
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,020
human uh for clicking on phishing links

894
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,659
like how could someone be so stupid and

895
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,840
then I personally had covid and was

896
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,440
laying in bed and was super exhausted I

897
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,320
had a fever of 103 and we had a lot of

898
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,179
brain fog I had a splitting headache and

899
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,760
I like leaned over and had this email

900
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,740
and was like wow that's weird

901
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,500
for those of you that are in the dod

902
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,399
back in the day on-prem Enterprise like

903
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,760
Outlook would have this limit of your

904
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,520
mailbox size and so once you actually

905
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,020
hit a certain limit because people are

906
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,600
sending like 25 megabyte files you end

907
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,760
up getting an alert saying hey you're

908
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,100
not going to receive any more email if

909
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,799
you don't clear out your inbox and I got

910
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,279
one of those for my Office 365 account

911
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,559
right that's that's not a thing I think

912
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,600
we can all agree that like I'm not over

913
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,880
my storage limit but for a split second

914
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,799
that was all it took for me to click on

915
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,320
that thing luckily I have other process

916
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,640
in place and didn't actually input my

917
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,080
credentials on the splash screen that

918
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,080
came up later but it happens right and

919
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,440
so process is in place to identify that

920
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
inside your organization that are free

921
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,360
right and have your playbooks I know

922
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,320
there's a lot of conversations that

923
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,820
we've talked about actual incident

924
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,860
response while we're here right that's

925
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,140
all stuff that you can do for free you

926
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,460
don't even have to spend a lot of money

927
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,919
on a solution for that you can build

928
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,200
your program to help that

929
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,520
um and that's why we're starting to see

930
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,279
like underwriter scans right and so in

931
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,600
cyber insurance

932
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,640
has anyone here in the commercials world

933
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
like has their cyber Insurance gone up

934
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,360
in the last year because like depending

935
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,760
on who you're talking to the amount of

936
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,640
increase is anywhere between like 50 and

937
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,279
400 percent depending on what they can

938
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,080
actually attest to with decreased

939
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,480
coverage in their renewal right and so

940
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,860
when you start reading those pieces

941
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,600
really carefully you realize that you

942
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,340
may not be covered but that's like a

943
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,380
whole nother separate conversation

944
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,580
yeah so we're actually seeing

945
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,860
Underwriters uh a number in the space

946
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,179
some of the billion dollar evaluation

947
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,399
Insurance Underwriters doing attack

948
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,679
surface mapping and scanning prior to

949
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,080
even giving you a quote because if you

950
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,320
do have 15 vulnerable RDP sessions if so

951
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,179
facto what the hell does the rest of

952
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,960
your network look like

953
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,880
okay and then we get to how

954
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,980
pretty standard stuff what's easy run

955
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,620
Mimi cats use Cobalt strike make a new

956
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,240
account

957
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,220
Playbook hasn't changed oh my God

958
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,779
security changes all the time it moves

959
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,340
so fast can you keep up with security

960
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,860
can you keep up it changes nah

961
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,158
don't change

962
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,840
hasn't changed in a long time we just

963
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,240
replaced like metasploy with Cobalt

964
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,700
strike that's it the process doesn't

965
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,799
change because people don't change

966
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,380
so if we were on a red team engagement

967
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,000
we were attacking somebody like a

968
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,260
corporate environment here in Augusta

969
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,099
what's the first thing that you're

970
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,960
probably going to do you're going to VPN

971
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,899
and put a pop here in Augusta and you're

972
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,460
gonna go buy some creds so that way you

973
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,379
can log in local coming from a local

974
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,359
node to look normal

975
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,859
because that's what persistence is it

976
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,619
looks normal the goal is to look normal

977
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,780
and if the goal is to look normal it's

978
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,219
going to happen very very fast because

979
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,800
you can automate all that stuff

980
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,679
so let's look at the timeline

981
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,719
dark Trace one of our partners love them

982
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,800
they do great work and they put out

983
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,080
great content so this is an actual

984
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,599
example of Conti ransomware

985
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,460
um initial true intrusion

986
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,020
August 1st

987
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,379
proxy shell vulnerability boom got in

988
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,739
August 13th 12 Days Later

C2

991
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,879
cool

992
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,540
August 14th one day later lateral

993
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,740

994
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,880
August 14th zero Days Later data X fill

995
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,640

997
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,420
so what happened

998
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,520
between those 12 days of initial

999
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,400
intrusion and C2 communication

1000
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,440
was that just a timer that was waiting

1001
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,480
or was that the amount of time it took

1002
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,300
organizationally for the the access

1003
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,500
broker to then get that information over

1004
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,140
to the lateral Movement Company to their

1005
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,599
third party to then go through and then

1006
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,040
hand off to Conte

1007
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,640
you start looking at the organizational

1008
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,140
structure the timelines start to make a

1009
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,940
hell of a lot more sense

1010
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,359
another case study right so this is the

1011
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:46,380
Health Service executive of Ireland uh

1012
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,240
and so if you are not familiar with it

1013
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,359
Conti hit them and shut down the entire

1014
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,540
system and generally Conti for public

1015
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,820
affairs reasons doesn't usually want to

1016
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,280
hit hospitals because there is no better

1017
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,640
way to have the strongest nations in the

1018
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,160
world start looking for you than to

1019
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,680
start shutting down like critical

1020
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,420
infrastructure like hospitals every

1021
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,820
people to die right every hospital in

1022
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,859
Ireland but even like Affiliates have

1023
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,660
problems so if you take a look at this

1024
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,940
one just with initial infection right of

1025
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,160
like March 18th and persistence achieved

1026
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,040
on the 23rd from like a red team or like

1027
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,320
bad guy perspective right that's

1028
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,480
probably the initial access broker who

1029
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,520
is trying to send out some type of

1030
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,220
fishing campaign throughout you know the

1031
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,060
entire organization of every hospital in

1032
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,700
Ireland and all of a sudden finally get

1033
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,440
to call back and finally checks that or

1034
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,880
has worked through all the rest of the

1035
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,099
callbacks in priority order and is

1036
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,980
compiling his list of targets to send

1037
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,780
because once they establish persistence

1038
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,760
they don't actually see any additional

1039
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,300
movement until the 7th of May when they

1040
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,520
compromised the first server

1041
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,980
after that now we're starting to talk

1042
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,780
about the actual affiliate getting in

1043
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,660
and expanding their access

1044
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,820
Hospital C identified malicious activity

1045
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,500
Hospital a communicates alerts of

1046
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,420
malicious activity the attacker browse

1047
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,940
folders based in the actual HSC

1048
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,460
infrastructure itself right

1049
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,560
attacker compromise six voluntary one

1050
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,359
statutory hospital this report is

1051
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,099
publicly available and it's a great

1052
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,980
report but this is over 4 000 locations

1053
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,180
54 acute hospitals and 70 000 devices

1054
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,260
right so in the end the only way that

1055
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,540
they were able to recover from this is

1056
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,220
because Conti realized that they had

1057
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,680
really screwed up and gave them the

1058
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,140
decryption key

1059
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,859
our bad sorry guys here's the decryption

1060
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,099
key at that point the only way that

1061
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,780
Ireland and like called the military

1062
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,780
called Interpol could stop it was

1063
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,480
shutting off all of the I.T access for

1064
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,300
every Healthcare facility in Ireland in

1065
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,280
the middle of a coveted pandemic

1066
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
talk about like if that was a private

1067
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,099
company

1068
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,119
right

1069
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,359
lost Revenue because it took four months

1070
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,119
for them to decrypt everything

1071
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,359
with the decryption key and with the

1072
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,980
Army's help

1073
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,119
so for those of you out there on the

1074
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,280
Army in the cpb be ready to just start

1075
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,900
running some decryptors on I don't know

1076
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,520
like critical infrastructure if it

1077
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,079
happens here you know

1078
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,460
so one of the interesting pieces during

1079
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,500
this period right they're out for four

1080
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,540
months

1081
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,119
the doctors went back to paper

1082
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,940
the nurses went back to paper a

1083
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,760
clipboard with a pencil like a

1084
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,339
neanderthal drawing on it and saying hey

1085
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,500
do surgery on this leg and then walking

1086
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,300
it with the patient and giving it to the

1087
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,920
surgeon to make sure they could do the

1088
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,119
work

1089
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,099
and to be even more scary how many of

1090
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,260
you those have actually had operations

1091
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,180
like major operations or sicknesses

1092
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,520
right so like I have and I definitely

1093
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,640
did not go to the same uh like X-ray

1094
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,859
place or blood work none of those were

1095
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,079
in the same place I went to like blood

1096
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,359
work here I went to get my x-ray at like

1097
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,220
this other lab that was outsourced blah

1098
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,839
blah blah and then I showed up for my

1099
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,280
actual surgery at the hospital where the

1100
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,460
or was so imagine your X-rays and your

1101
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,460
lab work having to follow you from three

1102
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,380
different locations so you can get into

1103
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,300
the room with the surgeon to cut the

1104
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,220
right leg

1105
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,359
okay brutal

1106
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,599
so we talk about changing our mindset

1107
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,940
it used to be oh we could keep them out

1108
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,460
we've got a firewall

1109
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,400
and then everybody said it's not if it's

1110
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,820
when

1111
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,839
that's old too

1112
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,500
zero trust assume compromise because the

1113
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,900
bad guys are already here

1114
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,400
once you realize that they're already

1115
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,720
here

1116
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,400
then you architect you build you deploy

1117
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,920
you maintain with a different mindset

1118
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,440
because your mindset's changed and you

1119
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,359
continue to move and this is not a New

1120
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,180
Concept John kindervag wrote about zero

1121
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,480
trust decades ago Google adopted it a

1122
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,920
decade ago

1123
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,200
they're already here they already have

1124
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,060
persistence because oh by the way when

1125
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,040
you talk to CEOs one of one of their

1126
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,260
biggest fears you sit down you ask them

1127
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,700
they're like well it could be a new

1128
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,859
competitor ending the market uh it could

1129
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,599
be a supplier variability it could be

1130
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,060
the demand Market but I'm actually

1131
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,619
really scared about one of my sales team

1132
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,060
leaving and taking their whole roll of

1133
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,020
decks and all my clients

1134
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,060
that's an Insider threat

1135
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,280
bad guys who are already here because

1136
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,359
they're already here they're already

1137
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,180
inside and they're a threat bad guys are

1138
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,379
just an Insider threat

1139
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,740
this is what we're fighting

1140
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,240
this is what we're finding because this

1141
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,180
Ransom note could also just be a picture

1142
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,400
from a competitor on their LinkedIn

1143
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,099
where you just realized that one of your

1144
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,660
sales or marketing or developers and

1145
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,920
Engineers took your intellectual

1146
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,780
property with you

1147
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,240
it doesn't have to be a ransom note it

1148
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,379
could just be a LinkedIn update

1149
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
we promised we'd show you some actual

1150
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,480
negotiations but look there's lots of

1151
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,980
words on a slide

1152
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,099
suffice it to say that

1153
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,200
bad guys are jerks there's no honor

1154
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,260
among Thieves they just fight back

1155
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,140
and here's the irony

1156
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,740
um

1157
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,240
is anyone there to help us we want to

1158
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,980
have a conversation with somebody but if

1159
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,180
only with somebody that's going to be

1160
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,619
professional

1161
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,200
we gave you the price it's reasonable

1162
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,160
and offensive huh offensive

1163
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,839
yeah this is coming from a bad guy

1164
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,700
that's attacking you and then when you

1165
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,900
come back and say hey could we get some

1166
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,820
help they call you offensive talk about

1167
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,440
the Mind Tricks

1168
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,560
there's some Jedis up in here

1169
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,119
so escalating what happens when you do

1170
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,440
get the call

1171
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,540
when you do get the call you don't have

1172
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,180
to be an uh a

1173
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,780
Jedi Council level incident responder to

1174
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,640
be able to help someone

1175
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,800
just ask questions

1176
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,240
I don't recommend making statements

1177
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,800
during an incident response I recommend

1178
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,780
asking questions

1179
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,119
have you talked with legal

1180
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,160
oh shoot I haven't looped legal into

1181
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,040
this okay just wait on that you know get

1182
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,660
one look at your plan have you talked

1183
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,280
with marketing I need to talk to

1184
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,380
marketing about a breach

1185
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,060
well you might

1186
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,680
because if they don't have themes and

1187
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,940
messaging that they can go to take to

1188
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,099
Market to inform your stakeholders you

1189
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,260
could potentially avoid all sorts of

1190
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,119
legal repercussions or lawsuits or et

1191
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,980
cetera et cetera Etc

1192
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,380
okay so let's call incident response

1193
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,940
oh by the way do you have your instant

1194
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,680
response and Disaster Recovery plans

1195
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,119
available

1196
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,200
yeah we do hold on

1197
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:45,540
I'm just impressed I actually had it

1198
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,119
printed right

1199
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,460
so then if you don't if you don't have

1200
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,260
them you don't have them updated

1201
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,359
that's that could be fine but you

1202
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,980
actually has to have them and follow

1203
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,200
them and then you decide when you need

1204
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,760
to deviate from them because there is a

1205
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,319
thing called failure to follow in the

1206
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:02,640
insurance industry and if you don't

1207
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,099
follow your own plan you how prudent

1208
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,480
were you really being

1209
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,520
and then by the way since incident

1210
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,079
response might be coming

1211
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,599
have you prepared to review logs

1212
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,300
how long can you get access to logs

1213
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,400
so obviously the goal here there's a

1214
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,859
million incidents that happen every hour

1215
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,780
those Innocents get triaged and some of

1216
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,420
them become incident become events

1217
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,240
become incidents the goal is to keep the

1218
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,540
breach Square as small as possible

1219
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,780
keep events to incidents and keep or

1220
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,220
keep breaches the incidents and instance

1221
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,140
to events

1222
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,819
so what's the actual cost

1223
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,319
you do get Ransom your company gets

1224
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,900
Ransom and they pay it maybe

1225
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,020
that payment is probably only 15 percent

1226
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,079
of the total cost of ransomware tax

1227
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,520
we're on the East Coast I'm sure you all

1228
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,800
remember Colonial pipeline

1229
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,680
why did colonial get shut down

1230
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,599
their scada system didn't get shut down

1231
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,940
the oil delivery system didn't get shut

1232
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,819
down their financial team got shut down

1233
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,160
so they couldn't take new orders and if

1234
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,599
you can't take new orders how can you

1235
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:07,800
deliver

1236
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,079
so that's where the vast majority of

1237
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,540
cost comes from is the inability to go

1238
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,460
to market

1239
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,319
and here's a future this isn't science

1240
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,240
fiction anymore

1241
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,420
Conti actually targeted the Costa Rican

1242
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,900
the Costa Rican government

1243
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,119
they shut them down they deployed

1244
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,260
ransomware

1245
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,880
ah okay

1246
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,319
that sucks

1247
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,660
here's the part that really hurts as

1248
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,839
Conti came in and they said

1249
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:40,020
you're going to pay us and if you don't

1250
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,880
we're going to support a coup against

1251
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,180
you

1252
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,420
not science fiction anymore non-state

1253
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,579
actors driving potential government

1254
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,740
changes right we had that slide about

1255
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,420
Knox state sponsored how long until

1256
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,400
like new opportunities become available

1257
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,079
to those states that are sponsoring

1258
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,460
right

1259
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,740
it's not theoretical anymore

1260
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,119
so who gets hit

1261
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,440
do you got dollars you're a Target

1262
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,240
um so we take a look at it Conti ranked

1263
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,339
in 77 million dollars in 21 months from

1264
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,020
ransomware

1265
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,680
um

1266
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,200
almost 2 000 Bitcoins depending on on

1267
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,140
quantity and dollars

1268
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,520
they do all right

1269
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,079
don't go join them by the way this is

1270
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,660
not a marketing campaign for them

1271
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,599
this is to inform you on what they do

1272
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,520
how they operate so that way you can

1273
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,560
look yourself in the mirror and say are

1274
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,780
they better than me or am I going to be

1275
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,579
better than them in order to protect my

1276
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,500
constituents and like Stefan said it's

1277
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,099
it's a competitor mindset right if you

1278
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,079
are part of a business and you are

1279
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,180
analyzing all the competition in your

1280
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,520
market and you're trying to do your

1281
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,140
actual like business continuity plans

1282
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,300
not necessarily focused on like cyber

1283
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,339
right but new competitors to the market

1284
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,680
changing landscape of like legal

1285
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,960
regulations why would you not view

1286
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,020
someone coming in and stopping your

1287
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,859
Revenue

1288
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:11,280
as a potential competitor right take it

1289
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,040
just as seriously at the board level as

1290
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,640
you would any other Revenue affecting

1291
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,720
object right

1292
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,859
so

1293
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:26,040
make sure you know yourself

1294
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,720
and make sure you leave time to know

1295
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,300
your adversary and your enemy

1296
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,579
because if you want to not fear the

1297
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,800
outcome of a hundred battles

1298
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,839
you got to know yourself in your enemy

1299
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,119
otherwise You're Dead on Arrival

1300
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,460
thank you very much um Steph morals is

1301
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,020
Adrian tillston unfortunately Sean ire

1302
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,280
couldn't be here

1303
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,839
um we'll go into questions before we do

1304
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,099
want to let you know that we both have

1305
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,500
job openings right now and the Army

1306
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,180
cyber Institute up at West Point is also

1307
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,940
hiring uh bachelor's Masters and PhD

1308
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,619
levels so if you're interested in those

1309
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,119
doing they're mostly sysadmin

1310
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,220
development type work they are hiring

1311
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,560
let us know we can go help you uh what

1312
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,700
questions do you have how can we help

1313
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,380
we also have prizes so I think I think

1314
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,640
the two guys that actually helped us

1315
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,319
while we were going uh we'll get to

1316
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,400
unless there's more questions but I'll

1317
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,819
say shirt color

1318
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,319
I have the question was for Conti did

1319
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,119
their training model modules get leaked

1320
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,640
not that I have seen it doesn't mean

1321
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,020
that they haven't been it just means

1322
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,000
that I have not seen them did you have a

1323
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,380
follow-on question

1324
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,800
okay

1325
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,740
great question so it's a combined public

1326
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,079
and private effort across a joint

1327
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,359
multinational Force

1328
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,200
um

1329
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,599
that's kind of a who was that out of an

1330
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,020
answer right

1331
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,300
is

1332
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,240
yeah so the question is uh generally

1333
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,160
who's responsible for going out like if

1334
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,619
we know the exact stakeholders with

1335
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,020
Stern and salamandra and Schwinn who's

1336
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,339
who's going out and targeting them to

1337
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,140
take them out I say take them out right

1338
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,720
I mean is take them off the market

1339
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,500
um

1340
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,280
so generally Interpol

1341
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,740
but Interpol just came out with an

1342
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,720
article they said publicly I think it's

1343
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,339
four months ago now I'd have to go back

1344
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,740
and look at the date Interpol said we

1345
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,420
cannot arrest our way out of this

1346
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,319
problem

1347
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,300
because the financial numbers are too

1348
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,400
high that's the first point so there's

1349
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,440
they're like supply and demand this the

1350
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,540
demand is very high for these people and

1351
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,560
the second part is because of

1352
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,640
extradition

1353
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,740
so if you look at Conti remember the

1354
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,440
vast majority of their playbooks and the

1355
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,380
messages were written in Cyrillic

1356
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,680
so russian-speaking adversaries and uh

1357
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,480
we're not really known for having a

1358
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,800
great relationship with them between

1359
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,760
five eyes and Russia

1360
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:00,060
yep yeah either protected actively or at

1361
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,280
least have a tacit Blind Eye

1362
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,000
great question

1363
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,839
yeah so the the book that I generally

1364
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,400
recommend reading about that problem to

1365
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,040
dig deeper into that is called hack 99

1366
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,300
and it starts taking it starts by

1367
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,460
looking at intellectual property loss as

1368
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,380
a case study with China and it also

1369
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,940
looks at Europe a little bit as well so

1370
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,460
it's a it's a former FBI investigator

1371
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,960
that was looking at a lot of these

1372
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,700
problems in the beginning in the nascent

1373
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,619
state of this and trying to get uh

1374
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,000
bureaucratic momentum in order to

1375
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,520
actually take bad players off the field

1376
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,839
um

1377
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,339
uh and unfortunately that means everyone

1378
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:51,540
in this room will be employed for quite

1379
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,099
some time

1380
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,359
back to that competitive landscape

1381
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,540
International

1382
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,300
uh the question is about money

1383
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,160
laundering so

1384
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,920
um the vast majority of the uh of the

1385
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,700
inbound dollars come in through Bitcoin

1386
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,960
um they are starting to shift a little

1387
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,339
bit but every time they shift the

1388
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,020
currency they actually have to switch

1389
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,940
their help desk processes in order to

1390
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,619
coach their the people that they've

1391
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,839
attacked on how to swap money around and

1392
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,640
then they throw it into they generally

1393
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,740
do a like they'll come in through

1394
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,480
Bitcoin they'll spin it through a couple

1395
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,520
other cryptocurrencies and then output

1396
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,020
and then they've got like banks on the

1397
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,280
mend that they'll they'll launder

1398
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,800
through as well so to that end

1399
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,460
um I forget rip saw I think a recent

1400
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,380
cryptocurrency that was just completely

1401
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,540
banned because there's legitimately no

1402
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,680
legitimate reason for its use other than

1403
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,180
anonymizing input and outputs and

1404
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,040
identities of where money's coming in

1405
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,480
and going so it's purpose is to

1406
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,800
anonymize you Start Tumbling all that

1407
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,800
stuff tumbling what I I don't want to go

1408
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,059
too far into it because I am not that

1409
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,859
knowledgeable but like General concept

1410
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,079
is you throw a couple Bitcoin in with

1411
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,520
some other people that are throwing in

1412
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,839
Bitcoin and then a bunch of different

1413
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,339
addresses get moved all around all over

1414
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:12,359
the place you can't track those

1415
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:13,559
transactions across the blockchain

1416
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,460
anymore

1417
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,839
um and so there are like Technical

1418
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,460
Solutions to how you actually money

1419
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,700
launder through different transitions um

1420
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,140
I am not an expert but that's generally

1421
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,319
how you can if one were to want to money

1422
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:28,500
launder that is like one way super

1423
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,020
hypothetically speaking

1424
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,819
yep

1425
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,040
what's that we got exchanges are also

1426
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,900
being cracked down on that's like one of

1427
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,240
those pieces now so yep

1428
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,799
four more minutes yes sir

1429
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,640
tornado cash thank you the tumbler

1430
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,619
oh the uh uh the really cool they're

1431
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:50,880
really cool article about tornado cash

1432
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,260
probably the best name of an article

1433
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,359
recently was called ofac around and find

1434
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:55,350
out

1435
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,830
[Laughter]

1436
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,819
how good are your backups

1437
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,819
laughs

1438
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,859
okay

1439
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,240
so

1440
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,819
I mean then you start elevating your

1441
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:33,359
yeah desirability uh ego definitely

1442
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,980
plays A Part they're not generally

1443
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,720
attacking people for political reasons

1444
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,240
but like

1445
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,440
fighting with Russia right that's that

1446
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,819
kind of goes down the ego Road pretty

1447
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:44,339
quickly too and effectively if if we go

1448
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:45,960
that route what we're basically doing is

1449
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,839
endur inducing the prisoners dilemma in

1450
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:51,720
all of our on all of our peers and it if

1451
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,520
if 10 of us say we're not going to do

1452
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,339
Bitcoin payments but one does the market

1453
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,619
is still there and we will continue to

1454
00:52:58,619 --> 00:52:59,520
Tumble

1455
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,859
so one really funny thing

1456
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:03,599
um that kind of goes along that line was

1457
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,300
at the conference um two like a week and

1458
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,040
a half ago was someone actually asked

1459
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,760
the question like would you spend fifty

1460
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,040
thousand dollars on a tool or some piece

1461
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,780
of technology or do you spend fifty

1462
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,000
thousand dollars buying Bitcoin now

1463
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,339
knowing that you're gonna get hit later

1464
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,440
while you know bitcoin's a little

1465
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,720
depressed right so like we know we're

1466
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,700
gonna get hit we'll get a deal right now

1467
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,160
right let's let's hope that we can hedge

1468
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,420
this against the next three years and

1469
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,680
it'll go back up

1470
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,720
um yeah maybe consider that as part of

1471
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,640
your holistic security program but not

1472
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,420
the program

1473
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,119
of the overall cost

1474
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,180
yes

1475
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,859
they're doing their good work and let's

1476
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,380
give them their 15

1477
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,480
points

1478
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,160
yeah so the question was

1479
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,240
um of

1480
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,460
because ransomware the payment itself is

1481
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,800
only 15 of the total cost

1482
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,480
um what else effectively what else can

1483
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,720
you do in order to drive that down

1484
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,180
yeah so the other a large portion of the

1485
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,040
other 85 and I forgive me I don't have

1486
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,839
these precise numbers

1487
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,700
um is that loss of the ability to go to

1488
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,660
market

1489
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,000
so when you so like if you're a b2c

1490
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,220
company and your platform shuts down and

1491
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,440
the customers on the seaside can't

1492
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,619
access your business then suddenly you

1493
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,780
can't have transactions and you don't

1494
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,579
have Revenue coming in and it's that

1495
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:38,220
lost Revenue that drives up the up the

1496
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,040
cost so much and and also just thinking

1497
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,000
about it from a different perspective

1498
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,380
like once you've been breached how much

1499
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,119
do you trust your infrastructure

1500
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,339
right like well we think they came this

1501
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,960
way we think this is what they did this

1502
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,300
is what the logs say is that is that

1503
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,579
truly the only place that they went do

1504
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:54,839
they have persistence in a different

1505
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:56,339
system because you're going to get hit

1506
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,500
multiple times with ransomware now right

1507
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,780
like you paid 500k and you're like

1508
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,180
too good we'll just detonate another one

1509
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,440
right so rebuilding your infrastructure

1510
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,940
also comes into that cost because how

1511
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,380
much how much does everyone in this room

1512
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,020
make right you start costing up counting

1513
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,079
up labor hours and overtime labor and

1514
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,780
over time incident response hours for

1515
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,540
Consultants to if you're I assume not

1516
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,040
many people in here have an internal

1517
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,720
incident Response Team

1518
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,300
um that is like the able to go through

1519
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,660
that level minus maybe the cpv yeah and

1520
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,099
if we if we ask the question do not

1521
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:33,300
raise your hands on this but if we ask

1522
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,760
the question in here of who's on an

1523
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,980
incident Response Team many of you would

1524
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,300
raise your hands and if I asked the

1525
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,300
follow-on question who is the incident

1526
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,619
response team because there's no one

1527
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,599
else almost everybody would still keep

1528
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,319
their hands up right

1529
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,439
more questions

1530
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:57,540
when was the last time you tested your

1531
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,579
backup process how long does it take you

1532
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,800
to actually Implement your like a backup

1533
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,680
on a system A to Z including all your

1534
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,819
configurations for all your network

1535
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,339
interface devices right because you're

1536
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,420
probably going to have to make sure that

1537
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,520
there's no additional I don't know

1538
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,260
Access Control list adjustments right

1539
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,160
something letting you through the

1540
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,559
firewall so you got to rebuild all of

1541
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,760
those configs

1542
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,740
how long does it take you to I don't

1543
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,859
know with like the Irish HSE 70 000

1544
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,000
endpoints

1545
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,800
they had to decrypt it because I don't

1546
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,059
know what the backup process would have

1547
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,559
taken but probably longer than the

1548
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,780
decryption you know and specifically if

1549
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,220
we're looking at a little bit tighter

1550
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,819
perspective I believe it was lockbit I

1551
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:37,079
was falling asleep I was reading the

1552
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:39,359
article because it was bedtime but um

1553
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,940
they were building new tools that

1554
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,280
specifically Target like veeam

1555
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,640
veeam as a backup engine and so when you

1556
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,200
like

1557
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,059
you bad guys will go to the same

1558
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,859
conferences and so when they walk in

1559
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:54,119
everybody's like oh I'll just restore

1560
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,800
from backup and I actually I did I

1561
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,720
rehearsed my backup and we did we tested

1562
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,460
and it was great bad guys sitting there

1563
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,599
going huh I guess I gotta detect the

1564
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:03,119
backups more how long ago was that

1565
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,059
backup created did you because I mean

1566
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,500
like they were there for eight weeks

1567
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,660
right with persistence on endpoint so

1568
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,839
like

1569
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,400
it's I

1570
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,559
if I gave you the statistics the

1571
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,000
standard deviation would be stupidly

1572
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,780
large yeah

1573
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:24,020
I'm sorry

1574
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,579
so I mean it depends how big you are and

1575
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,680
it depends like what you're recovering

1576
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,760
um I hate to give the consultant answer

1577
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,079
but that's what I'm going to double down

1578
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,119
on because like HSC with the decryption

1579
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,040
stuff took them four months

1580
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,660
with the army

1581
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,920
right so like think about your

1582
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,180
organization and

1583
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,099
so let's let's use a specific example

1584
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:47,099
here and uh one of our our co-clients

1585
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,079
who shall remain unnamed

1586
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:52,319
they haven't basically an iot flat

1587
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,220
Network

1588
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,880
that has zero backups and if they were

1589
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,460
to put their entire team security and it

1590
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,980
and sys admins and help desk on just

1591
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,660
building the backups it would take them

1592
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,280
about six weeks just to build the

1593
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,960
backups one time not to mention all the

1594
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,160
operating maintain that goes along with

1595
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,880
that

1596
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,980
because they didn't get it baked in from

1597
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,720
from they didn't bake in security

1598
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,059
originally so as we look at it just goes

1599
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:17,339
on and on and on kind of like my answer

1600
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,920
right now which means we are done I

1601
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,300
believe so the next speaker can come up

1602
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,440
is that correct

1603
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,579
all right thank you guys so much

1604
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:24,780
appreciate you coming in I hope you

1605
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,140
learned something

1606
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,140
if
