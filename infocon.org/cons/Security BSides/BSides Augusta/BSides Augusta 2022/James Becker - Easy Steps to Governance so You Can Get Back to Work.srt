1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,019
good morning everybody uh very excited

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,400
to be here today talk to you about

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
governance I understand this is probably

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
the most boring topic that you wanted to

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,400
come out and see today uh do the

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,420
schedule changes you might have thought

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,920
you walked into a different uh meeting

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,900
but either way you're here now we're

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,980
going to have some fun it's not going to

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,019
be boring

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,720
uh so who I am so I'm James I'm an

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,098
instructor at the Cyber Center of

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,960
Excellence currently I've been doing

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,239
specifically cyber security since 2015

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,360
doing both offense and defense

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,739
uh some of the work roles that I've had

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,200
I've been working in it uh information

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Tech information security for about 20

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,239
years and then a couple of uh a couple

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
of my certificates so you can see them

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,300
I'm allowed to actually be up here in

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,839
front of you today

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,920
so our agendas today we're going to do a

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,960
quick overview of governance and talk

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,399
about the culture and culture changes

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,559
that are necessary in order to embrace

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,719
this governance culture we'll talk about

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,099
a couple of Frameworks really quickly

29
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,680
we'll get into some policy and then some

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,500
questions so just to make it clear the

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,960
boring stuff is labeled obviously this

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,299
is actually the fun stuff okay this is

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,000
actually going to be fun today

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040
so keep an open mind

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,060
ah

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,460
so who cares about governance and policy

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,560
well everybody does you just might not

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,180
know that you care about it yet hey we

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,000
got one hand I like that

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,580
so administrators so I've met if maybe

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,259
if I had a dime for every administrator

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,240
that I've met who complained about I

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,799
don't have the tools and the resources

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,659
to do whatever or they require me to do

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,740
these other things that aren't really

46
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,659
what I want to do I mean I would have

47
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,299
like a lot more money than I have now

48
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:46,079
I'd probably still be here talking

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,220
though

50
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,579
so managers so managers whenever they

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,020
don't have proper governance items in

52
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,340
place they can't understand why their

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,960
people aren't doing whatever it is they

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,700
want them to be doing

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,680
the analysts I mean they can't

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,700
understand why the manager can't

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,560
understand anything right but uh that's

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,540
where we are

59
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,820
everyone else so all the executives the

60
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,520
lawyers uh Auditors all the people that

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,199
care about your bottom line right they

62
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,459
really care about how you govern your

63
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,739
organization

64
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,540
why you should care about it I mean

65
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
whenever you have effective governance

66
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,660
effective policies in place you can get

67
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,860
back to work and you can do those things

68
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,200
you actually like to do

69
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,420
and job satisfaction I mean whenever you

70
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,800
have a policy or some kind of government

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,660
document that you can point to and say

72
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,340
this is exactly why I'm doing what I'm

73
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,780
doing this is how it's helping my

74
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,640
organization I mean you can feel really

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,720
good about the work that you're doing

76
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
and you can prove it because you can

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,579
point to it

78
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,440
all right so here's your 30 second nap

79
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,700
we're going to talk a little bit about

80
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,560
these uh definitions here because if I

81
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,519
didn't I might get in trouble

82
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,739
so governance so here's a whole lot of

83
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,000
words about it

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,519
um so really it just gets down to saying

85
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,019
that you're doing what you must do and

86
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,220
you're doing it in a way that's

87
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,000
agreeable to everybody

88
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,980
so some of the key documents that we'll

89
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,720
talk about

90
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,819
save your corporate vision mission and

91
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,379
strategy who can tell me a difference

92
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,760
between a vision and a mission

93
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,819
is there a difference let's start with

94
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,080
that is there a difference between a

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040
vision and a mission

96
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,360
okay and then how we're going to get

97
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,980
there to find the mission okay

98
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,959
good yeah yeah so so they're both future

99
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,060
oriented since you uh since you raised

100
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,500
your hand there you get the uh you get

101
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,480
the first prize of the day

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
so as we're talking about Vision right

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,659
we're talking very long term so we're

104
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,280
talking five to twenty years whenever

105
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
you talk about a mission statement

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,159
you're just talking about the next year

107
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,680
all right so your mission is going to be

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,480
your next year these are the things that

109
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,220
our company's going to do your vision is

110
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,379
where we plan to be five to 20 years

111
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,060
from now strategy is just how you're

112
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,920
going to get there

113
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,659
so standards in law so these things

114
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,120
again requirements so these can be

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,260
International standards you're going to

116
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,280
have different laws depending on what

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
industry you're in

118
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,580
policies this can be the fun one we talk

119
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,500
about today again this is a mandate for

120
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,659
you you have to adhere to policies

121
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,879
guidelines these are the things that

122
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,918
help you achieve those standards laws

123
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,959
and policies so they're not necessarily

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,579
mandated but there's a lot of good ideas

125
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,959
in there they're going to help you to

126
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,120
implement what you need to in your your

127
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,639
organization to adhere to all these

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,259
other things and then you have things

129
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,259
like procedures your uh your ttps things

130
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,460
like that so those are the things that

131
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,280
actually tell you how to do your task

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,820
so governance as a culture so

133
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
it takes time to change culture it takes

134
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,720
time to actually embrace you know what

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
it is and what you've got to do to get

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
there but whenever you have it it's

137
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,820
going to help so I mean I get it we're

138
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,800
all busy enough uh we're going to walk

139
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,060
through today you're going to see it's

140
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,120
actually not that hard uh to enable some

141
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,820
uh some good policy in your organization

142
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,979
so yes you are busy this is going to

143
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,240
free up some of your time as long as you

144
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
do it right

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
so it has to be supported at all levels

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,220
so how do you get people to care about

147
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,199
it I mean you've got to find some way to

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,699
appeal to your boss or whoever's going

149
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,759
to sign it and you have to get your peer

150
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,960
reviews and then that way you know

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
everybody's on the same page and

152
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,360
everybody's sure that you're going to be

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,160
happy with the outcome

154
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,139
and then discipline is required right so

155
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,479
you can't write some policy if nobody's

156
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,800
going to back it up so here's where you

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,979
really need that top-down buy-in

158
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,440
so Frameworks uh so here's a bunch of

159
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,300
Frameworks how many people in here have

160
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,699
studied for a certification exam

161
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,500
probably the whole room all right so

162
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,600
we've all seen these we all know these

163
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,340
are incredibly dull

164
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,239
so we're going to move on

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
so policy is the Easy Button

166
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
uh so what we need here

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,280
is we're going to think about a

168
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,320
bottom-up approach so all the different

169
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
certifications we study for say policy

170
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,460
needs to be top down problem is top

171
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,560
doesn't always understand down

172
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,419
I mean how are they supposed to make a

173
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:58,919
policy for us if they don't understand

174
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,539
what it is we do day-to-day and what we

175
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,680
truly care about

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,479
so we need to find a way in this

177
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,820
bottom-up approach to feed that policy

178
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,340
up high get them to sign it and then

179
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,520
that way we can have what we want

180
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,680
and I mean yeah so think about it right

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
if management needs paperwork they need

182
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,400
slides they need memos and all these

183
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
other things because that's what gives

184
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,940
them their job satisfaction it proves

185
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,160
their boss that they've done something

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,900
so we need to feed them the paperwork so

187
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,100
that they're happy

188
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,020
uh and paperwork really isn't that hard

189
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,060
I mean it may seem hard at first and a

190
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,319
lot of people I mean we sit down and

191
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,000
kind of get like a writer's block

192
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,740
and you're like oh I really don't know

193
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,240
what I want to say here so we'll walk

194
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,860
through that but it's really not that

195
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,960
hard so so if you could just take a

196
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,060
second close your eyes

197
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,560
and think about a manager that you've

198
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,819
had in the past

199
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,740
so so not not the really good manager

200
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,479
that you've had in the past think about

201
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,580
the manager that you had you couldn't

202
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,100
believe got dressed every day and showed

203
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,319
up to work on time that's the manager I

204
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,520
want you to think about

205
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,259
and I open your eyes

206
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,380
realize that person wrote paperwork I

207
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,300
mean if they could do it you've got to

208
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,139
be able to do it way better

209
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,520
so our steps to get there

210
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,539
so we're going to define the problem

211
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:13,979
like every other process right we're

212
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,900
going to start by defining the problem

213
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,360
so think about a time you want to see

214
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
your little water cooler conversation

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
and somebody was standing there and

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,460
they're telling you all about how you

217
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,080
know this thing at work is really crappy

218
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,580
and I know I could do it way better by

219
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,199
doing this

220
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,880
I mean that's really easy and that's

221
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,740
actually the first two steps

222
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,479
so we're going to define the problem and

223
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,979
imagine the ideal solution to that

224
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,159
problem

225
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,240
so as we Define that solution I mean

226
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
just sit back think about whatever it is

227
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,319
it doesn't have to be realistic at this

228
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,120
point so we know there's a problem and

229
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
we know that something we want to fix

230
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
so grab your coffee your monster and

231
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,180
your Cheetos and a beanbag chair and sit

232
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
back and think about how great your life

233
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,479
could be if only you could enact this

234
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,180
policy for a day

235
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,699
write down your thoughts so if you're a

236
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,800
doodler start doodling if you like

237
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,660
diagrams start making diagrams if you

238
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,940
like writing just start writing nothing

239
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,099
is wrong at this point these are all the

240
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,080
things that you want to get you from

241
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,479
your problem to your ideal solution so

242
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,240
just spit it all out on paper or on a

243
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,639
whiteboard or however you want to do it

244
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,099
and get your thoughts down

245
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,199
step four just take a rest I mean leave

246
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
it sit for a day or two think about what

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,680
it was you wrote down think about it

248
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
from different perspectives is this

249
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,979
really going to get you there is this is

250
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,419
this really going to get signed is

251
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,559
anybody going to agree with this

252
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,339
step five let's get a peer review in

253
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,179
there

254
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,559
so pass it around to some of your

255
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,779
teammates and see is this good is this

256
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,799
actually going to work for our company

257
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,360
is this actually going to work for me is

258
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,680
this going to get me the time that I

259
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
want to be able to get back on keyboard

260
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,740
and stop writing these policies

261
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,500
and step six so we need to get a

262
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
signature we don't need your signature

263
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,040
right we want to get your boss's boss's

264
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
signature we got to go up a couple of

265
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,459
levels then that way you have some kind

266
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,860
of top cover to say I am allowed to do

267
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,200
this today because this policy from your

268
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,420
boss says I can

269
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,620
foreign

270
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,240
so step one we're going to define the

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,820
problem so I just want to ask uh

272
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,320
everybody here and give me a couple of

273
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
ideas what's something that happens in

274
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,980
your work week that you feel is a waste

275
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,160
of time

276
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,620
I mean we got some Chuckles somebody

277
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,279
give me something

278
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,779
driving meetings hey look at that you

279
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,899
get the second gift I love it

280
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,420
thanks submitting sucked the soap for my

281
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,140
life that's the problem

282
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,980
I mean everybody has been in that

283
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,540
situation walking down the hallway and

284
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,820
here comes the Grim Reaper probably your

285
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,800
boss and says I want you to be in this

286
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
meeting great

287
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,839
here goes the next hour of my life

288
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,720
so my ideal solution

289
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,820
so this is my Utopia so I get to plan it

290
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,200
however I want

291
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,279
probably going to be on a beach

292
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,040
somewhere not sitting in that meeting

293
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,420
probably going to have an awesome desk

294
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,060
like this thing it's gonna be so cool

295
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,100
let me banging out all kind of code and

296
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,200
programs and scripts to make my life so

297
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
much easier so I don't have to go to

298
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,740
that meeting anymore

299
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,060
so this is where I want to get to

300
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,320
start writing about it

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
so in this exercise uh you can see

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,899
autocorrect got a little angry at me but

303
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,740
uh

304
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,240
this is just one of the methods of

305
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,500
brainstorming where you just sit down

306
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,820
and you just start typing you might give

307
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,560
yourself a five minute time limit time

308
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,300
limit you give yourself a 10 minute time

309
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,279
limit you start doodling your pictures

310
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,899
it doesn't matter

311
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,459
but the point is just to get all your

312
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,500
thoughts down as I work through this

313
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,480
exercise and I'm thinking about it

314
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,540
right down somewhere in here

315
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,940
oh they can set that one meeting I

316
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,740
actually have something to talk about

317
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,220
so I you know describe my Utopia you can

318
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,440
see I really need that chair that's

319
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,779
written in there a couple of times but I

320
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,180
describe my Utopia to frame that problem

321
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,240
I considered you know all solutions

322
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,620
right you can see me kind of banter

323
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,420
about uh probably get sand on my

324
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,320
keyboard that's probably not going to

325
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,420
work too good uh so I've thought about

326
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,279
this thing a little bit and and I

327
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,779
thought yeah you know what there is one

328
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,459
meeting I should probably go to

329
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,959
so this is just a method that you can

330
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,640
use I mean again like I said you can

331
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,459
draw it up however you like but make

332
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,860
sure you write it down diagram it draw a

333
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,480
picture

334
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,860
step four we're just going to take a

335
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,779
break I mean we're in Augusta right so

336
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,480
we're gonna go hit the golf course

337
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,060
so during this time just reflect on it

338
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,040
did you actually think about it is

339
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,839
anybody actually going to sign it uh

340
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
what are your peers going to think about

341
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,880
it

342
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,100
so start to formulate it into something

343
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,660
a little more coherent than the last bit

344
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,519
of gibberish I had up there

345
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,079
and we'll move into step five where we

346
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,620
get a peer review

347
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,220
so what you think bro says me

348
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,620
bro says well it turns out you forgot

349
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,180
something really important I mean you

350
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,140
kind of talked about you had this

351
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,120
meeting but you didn't really Define it

352
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,079
very well

353
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,420
so make sure you incorporate that into

354
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,820
your your policy here

355
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,740
so now we get closer to what our policy

356
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,120
is

357
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,160
going to be very simple policy doesn't

358
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,860
have to be big just needs to be clear

359
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,899
it needs to be communicated clearly it

360
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,459
needs to demonstrate exactly what it is

361
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,839
you want

362
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
and uh that makes it effective right

363
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,800
so in this uh so we have I just picked

364
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,660
Windows systems analyst for an example

365
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,040
they're going to attend the weekly sync

366
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,660
that they actually care about

367
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,640
uh and if you want to get them to do

368
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,620
something else well then you have to

369
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,839
talk to the department lead

370
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,579
so let me tell you the best part about

371
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,839
policy this is the policy we want

372
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,639
so if you notice that second little line

373
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,260
there that probably leads us to another

374
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,120
policy because there's going to have to

375
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,740
be some kind of process and policy

376
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,139
procedure to request

377
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,639
us at a meeting

378
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
from the Department lead

379
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,360
don't write that policy

380
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,120
step six or signature

381
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,920
mm-hmm

382
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,540
so we put this thing onto the fancy

383
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,339
official looking letterhead put a date

384
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,320
on it

385
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,820
again we defined in here what exactly we

386
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,740
want to do everything we don't want to

387
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,600
do now we've got to struggle to get

388
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
somebody to sign this thing

389
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,000
so we're working to get the Big Kahuna

390
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,740
how we're going to achieve this is we're

391
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,600
going to take some kind of example that

392
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,459
proves that this policy is valuable to

393
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,019
them and the company

394
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,480
so in this situation I've decided I'm

395
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,279
going to go to the Big Kahuna and say

396
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,980
listen if you sign this policy

397
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,680
we're going to gain 39 work hours per

398
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,019
week per analyst by not sitting in

399
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,339
meetings

400
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,120
signed

401
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,500
so as long as you can appeal to them

402
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,880
then you'll be good to go

403
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,779
some reviews so we went through a quick

404
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,139
scenario we talked about policy we

405
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,760
talked about how to create a policy how

406
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
easy it can be to get from you know

407
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,860
nothing at all in a bad situation where

408
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,940
you're sitting in meetings all the time

409
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,920
to get to your ideal situation where you

410
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,660
no longer have to be in meetings

411
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,760
and it's not that hard I mean again like

412
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,139
we talked about paperwork isn't

413
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:19,920
difficult

414
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,019
uh it's just you've actually got to you

415
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,519
know do a little bit of work

416
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,620
and get somebody to sign it I know your

417
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,420
life would be better

418
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,120
uh so we Define the problem uh imagine

419
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,980
that ideal situation

420
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,600
write down your thoughts about it and

421
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,860
that's where you just vomit everything

422
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,779
out it's going to be okay

423
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,519
give it a rest and start cleaning it up

424
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,040
pass it around to your peers and then

425
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,880
get that signature

426
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,699
so what are your questions on policy or

427
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,839
what else would you like to talk about

428
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,560
yes

429
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,660
foreign

430
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,300
right so

431
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,579
yeah so so is uh whether or not policy

432
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,199
has an expiration date so you could

433
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,000
write a policy that says it expires in a

434
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,019
year

435
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,600
right but ideally uh so in my opinion I

436
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
think every year everything should be

437
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,779
reviewed because if you show up to a new

438
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,040
organization and you're a brand new

439
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,720
person and you take a look at your

440
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,459
policies and these policies are two

441
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,720
three years old especially if you're

442
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,699
talking cyber security anything that's

443
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,440
two or three years old in cyber security

444
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,000
might as well be from the 90s or

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,519
something right it's archaic so really I

446
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,560
mean as you can see in this example not

447
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,880
much is going to change in that year to

448
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,220
year so you know just go through there

449
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,959
change the date take it back to the Big

450
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,820
Kahuna and be like hey this is the same

451
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,380
policy from last year I changed the date

452
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,060
can you get us a new signature and keep

453
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,740
it fresh and that way as you have people

454
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,600
onboarding it's still it's still fresh

455
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,980
right

456
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,860
yes so how do you when you're dealing

457
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,360
with larger organizations you have

458
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
multiple stake

459
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,660
different organizations what are some

460
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,120
approaches you would take to try and get

461
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,279
everybody on board your

462
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,019
Insurance trained to actually try and

463
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,639
make things work yeah so larger

464
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,620
organizations can actually kind of be

465
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,720
beneficial in this situation because in

466
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,399
a larger organization you have even more

467
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,260
systems analysts and you probably have

468
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,240
different segments and teams of systems

469
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,339
analysts so if you can get all the

470
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,440
systems analysts to agree and take a you

471
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,240
know again this peer review comes in

472
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,740
you've got to take it serious whenever

473
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,899
these things come around give your input

474
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,060
because that's your your peer uh

475
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,680
validation to that

476
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,440
so as you have this larger organization

477
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,760
now maybe you have two or three hundred

478
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,800
people kind of like uh co-signers on

479
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,360
this thing saying like yes we agree to

480
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,339
this and we need this well now the boss

481
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,839
is forced with a decision that's going

482
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,180
to affect 200 people if they don't sign

483
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,800
this policy is going to negatively

484
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,320
affect those 200 people so you actually

485
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
have power and numbers in that in that

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,620
thing but yeah so you have to kind of

487
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,180
work I mean again like you said you have

488
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,880
more people more personalities and

489
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,620
that's where your policy may start as

490
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,880
simple as this one was and then it

491
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,740
starts to grow legs and it starts to get

492
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,540
a little crazy on you but try to keep it

493
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,639
back to the to ensure that it's defining

494
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
that core problem that you defined and

495
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,120
as long as you're still meeting that

496
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,920
objective and you're you're getting rid

497
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,020
of the stuff that you didn't want then

498
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,220
now you'll be good yeah

499
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,400
the questions we have

500
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,119
I'm sorry

501
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,900
so that's where we need the top down

502
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,119
approach right so and it depends on your

503
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,459
organization uh you know by by not

504
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,959
adhering to policy you can be fired

505
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,720
right but things like this probably

506
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,459
wouldn't be so drastic but you should

507
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,679
have some kind of formal review with

508
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,299
your teammates at some time during their

509
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,280
careers to explain to them like hey

510
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,600
here's some things that you're not doing

511
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,700
so well and you can also look for

512
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,140
positive reinforcements so we don't

513
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,640
always need negative reinforcement for

514
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,340
things so look for ways to positively

515
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,900
reinforce it right so maybe it's your

516
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,340
company meetings you know you get an

517
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,200
extra little 50 bump in your paycheck or

518
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,280
something like that some kind of little

519
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,260
bonus or a cake or Donuts that day

520
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,880
because people are doing well and

521
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,020
adhering to the things that you want

522
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,120
them to so you know through positive

523
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,580
reinforcement you can get people to do

524
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,320
what you want them to do but they

525
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,980
actually want to do it

526
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,280
yes

527
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,280
so I mean really in this example in the

528
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,340
bottom-up approach doesn't matter to you

529
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,260
if it matters to you then it's worth

530
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,179
writing I mean if it's going to save you

531
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,799
from a couple of meetings I mean I would

532
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,059
love to write a bunch of these and save

533
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,280
myself from a ton of meetings right but

534
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,500
um whatever the work activity is so I

535
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,640
mean if it's already in your position

536
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,020
description or something well then

537
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,480
you're not going to be able to to negate

538
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,940
that through a policy but if it's

539
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,260
something that you know it's taking your

540
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,700
time it's kind of outside of your realm

541
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
it's not in your position description

542
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,140
well then write a policy right so so

543
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,400
it's not only just to get out of work

544
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
though but it could be silly stuff

545
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,360
whereas you know I really need people to

546
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,460
follow these procedures and these ttps

547
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,440
that I've written but nobody wants to

548
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,419
follow them right and now they're going

549
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,799
through they're administering your

550
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,539
systems and they're not doing it the way

551
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,520
you want them to so you define that in a

552
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,200
policy and then that way you know it's

553
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,780
like hey it's here you being a member of

554
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,280
this organization you must adhere to

555
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,260
this policy and this policy says you

556
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,940
need to follow all these procedures so

557
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,620
that's another you know way that you

558
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,660
would determine yes this is something

559
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,320
worth writing

560
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,799
yes

561
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,100
yeah so so trying to get rid of a policy

562
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,780
and so I'm crazy about this I read

563
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,419
everything I really do so whenever I

564
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,220
join a new organization I find all those

565
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,480
policies and I look at them and it's

566
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,280
like hey this one's a little weird and a

567
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,419
lot of times going back to her question

568
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,700
here earlier how long is a policy good

569
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
for a lot of times you're going to find

570
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,580
these policies and they've been hanging

571
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,679
on a board for a couple of years and you

572
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,940
know they're still there but they're

573
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,679
stale so nobody's actually passionate

574
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,120
about it anymore whoever signed that

575
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,280
policy has moved on and in that case it

576
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,840
can be really easy I mean it's just draw

577
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,760
attention to the fact that like hey we

578
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,080
have this thing it's stale it doesn't

579
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,460
apply anymore

580
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,440
um you know can we can we reword these

581
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,179
little bits here

582
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,740
um so that's the best case scenario

583
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
where it's really easy to do other times

584
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,679
you might have somebody that's really

585
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,179
passionate about it and they had just

586
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,740
written it and it's you know hot off the

587
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,740
press but that's where you just need to

588
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,240
read it and you know find a way to

589
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,700
communicate again like in our example if

590
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,200
we get rid of this we're going to

591
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
increase our work hours or we're going

592
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,140
to you know increase our efficiency

593
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,640
we're going to increase the bottom line

594
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,320
so it's just finding a way to

595
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,360
communicate to the person that wrote

596
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,980
that policy whatever they're passionate

597
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,660
about so you might have to be a little

598
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,799
bit personal with them to understand

599
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,140
what makes them tick and then as soon as

600
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,400
you can find that thing then that gives

601
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,020
you the leverage to be able to you know

602
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,520
get that seat at the table to explain

603
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,440
how you can do it better and why it

604
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,820
needs to be changed

605
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,299
so

606
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,559
do we have any other questions here

607
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,860
okay well I'm going to close up earlier

608
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,000
then everybody's going to get to

609
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,220
Chick-fil-A a little faster huh so hey

610
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,140
thanks for coming out I really enjoyed

611
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,940
getting a chance to talk to you hope

612
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,559
this helped you out and uh you can go

613
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,360
back write some effective policy for

614
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,039
yourself and make your life a little

615
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,000
easier

616
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,900
all right thank you
