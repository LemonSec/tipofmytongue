1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,599
I started by accident right

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,820
and I was just like I left a consulting

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,520
firm I went to work at a new company my

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,960
old company I said to them how much

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,660
notice do you need and they're like whoa

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,000
 if you can do excuse me this talk

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,699
is going to be about a PG-13

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,000
um I'll let you know if it gets to R but

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,920
uh so they said you know if you can do

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,540
stuff on the side

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,280
you can leave in two weeks we'll finish

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,480
some projects you'll do some stuff

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,219
that'll be great so I went to my new

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,559
boss I said hey man you know is it

15
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,540
possible for me to do some stuff on the

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,399
side and he's like I don't know and he

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,219
went and he negotiated with HR to get me

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,320
an exception right which is crazy

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,460
because I was working for Bank of

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,660
America

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,340
so the Monday I started at Bank of

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,379
America that night I started as secure

23
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,320
ideas and the plan was just to have a

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,879
really great Christmas for my family

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,880
like make a little bit of money stop not

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,320
do it anymore like help the company

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,080
transition that was 12 years ago and 26

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
staff members so I'm not exactly sure

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
how that plan worked but sometime in

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,760
like December I had a guy call me and

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,439
he's like Hey Kevin do you know anybody

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,420
who would be interested in sponsoring

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,860
this conference

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,979
and I'm like me how much is it

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,659
and he told me it was a conference out

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,700
in DC I'm like oh yeah cool so I paid

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,080
him the money signed the contract all

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,400
that kind of stuff

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,140
about two weeks later the dude calls me

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,540
up and he's like Hey Kevin

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,759
do you have a logo we need a logo for

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,619
the website like that you're sponsoring

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,619
and I'm like a logo you're right I

44
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,900
need a logo like if I want to be a real

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,759
business right like I'm gonna be a big

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
boy when I'm older right whatever right

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,100
I need a logo so I created our logo and

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,899
I was so proud of this like let me be

49
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,780
very clear I am not artistic okay

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,000
um I go to museums and go huh that's a

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
snow shovel and they're like no it's art

52
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,680
that's real art in New York it's a snow

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,719
shovel hanging from the ceiling I don't

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,758
understand it I think it came from Ace

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,400
Hardware but

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,920
so I build the logo then I go out to the

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,300
conference and I'm really proud of

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,040
myself right like I got a real business

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
card I'm real and I go and I see a

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,819
friend of mine he and I are going to

61
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,500
speak together Tom Esten we're doing

62
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,959
that guy is so smart and so we're going

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,580
to do this presentation and he I said

64
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,379
man hey

65
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,840
here's my card and I handed my business

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,180
card right like I'm all excited and he

67
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,220
looks at it and he says to me

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,080
Hey Kevin

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,440
why do you have the Key Bank logo on

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,420
your business card

71
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,220
and I went I don't have the Key Bank

72
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,980
logo on my business card he's like yeah

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,620
you do and he pulls out an ATM card and

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,860
I'm like I have the KeyBank logo on

75
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,080
my business card so we hired somebody at

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,819
logo design Guru to create the lock with

77
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,280
the light bulb uh so that's this is why

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,500
me making fun of logos is really not

79
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,720
important because so in case you guys

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
aren't worried or wondering

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,459
um I'm going to speak on API security

82
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,840
for the next hour

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,519
now if you've ever seen me speak before

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
or if you've ever met me you will know

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,140
what that means is I'm going to tell

86
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,900
random things that pop into my head for

87
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,000
about an hour and I'm going to hope to

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,519
keep them all related to API security

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,260
but I've already failed at that because

90
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,519
we have an entire conversation about

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,800
logos right but I'm going to do my best

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm Kevin and for the people who don't

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,440
know I am the founder of secure ideas

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,560
right we are a I I found I found out

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,780
recently we are referred to as a

96
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,879
lifestyle business

97
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,040
right it was just the weirdest name like

98
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,420
what do you mean a lifestyle business

99
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,420
does that mean I'm a workaholic and uh

100
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,940
we are a small boutique pen test company

101
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,640
that's what we do we don't do IR we

102
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,920
don't do forensics what we do is we

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,319
break in we tell you your baby is ugly

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
and we go home

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,480
and let me be very clear all babies are

106
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,560
ugly

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,620
we lie to parents up until the point the

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,480
kid is like three months old

109
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,939
right oh your baby's beautiful no it's

110
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,280
not it's a barely formed adult like a

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,940
person their skull has holes in it they

112
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,238
don't have kneecaps they Bend in weird

113
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,139
ways and they fall over they're ugly I

114
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,880
got two kids I'll tell you right now

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
when they were born they handed me I

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,300
went oh my God she's beautiful and I was

117
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,520
wrong

118
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,600
I just the way it is right but about

119
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,340
three months they start to become real

120
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,360
people

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,160
and you're like okay that one's cute

122
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,680
that one not so good don't ask right it

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,540
happens so I'm the founder of secure

124
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,300
ideas I'm also an is faculty member

125
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,600
I am an open source fanatic I run a

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
whole bunch of Open Source projects I'm

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,080
the vice chair of the projects committee

128
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,000
for owasp which is really not an

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,199
accomplishment I don't think anybody

130
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,520
else wanted the job

131
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,580
I speak all over the place which is nuts

132
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
because I suck at it

133
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,860
um and I do some Star Wars stuff

134
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,020
that's me in the costumes

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,180
I build screen accurate Star Wars

136
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,340
costumes and then visit kids in the

137
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,660
hospital and raise money for charity

138
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,740
right so my favorite pitcher up there

139
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,660
is the Darth Vader that's me in the

140
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,180
Darth Vader they brought 300 blind kids

141
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,560
in

142
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,300
and they had them watch the movie which

143
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,740
I thought was interesting that they

144
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,060
still referred to it I'm not I'm not

145
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,680
trying to make a joke like that was

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,000
interesting right like how language

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,060
works like oh they watched the movie and

148
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,979
in my head I'm thinking

149
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,100
no but but right and then we stood there

150
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,780
for three hours

151
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,639
and the kids felt what the characters

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,960
look like

153
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,060
I will acknowledge that I am crying in

154
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,740
that helmet that's why I don't do face

155
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,259
characters right when you walk into a

156
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,360
child's hospital room and they got tubes

157
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,979
everywhere and they just light up

158
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,320
because Chewbacca showed up

159
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,780
it's worth the fake hair in my eyes the

160
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,240
tap it in right there right like it is

161
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,340
nuts I recommend it highly everybody

162
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,100
should join should should go out and

163
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,360
help even if you don't want to wear the

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,880
costumes right we need help getting

165
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,340
dressed that sounds wrong

166
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,860
a little bit like hi could you help me

167
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,560
dress I'm a little bit of a diva but um

168
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,979
right so like and I'm on stilts do you

169
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,440
know what sucks about those stilts

170
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm not coordinated I am amazed I

171
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,060
haven't fallen off of this stage and

172
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,220
it's a flat floor

173
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,860
right like I just suck at things like

174
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,800
were you in Sports no I'm an avid

175
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,060
endorsement

176
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,940
so what we're going to talk about today

177
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,639
is apis we're going to talk about some

178
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,280
of the different things the benefits and

179
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
the risks of how apis work and how we

180
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,199
integrate with them and I want to be

181
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,419
very clear I named this talk Happy Happy

182
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,639
Joy Joy uh one because I thought it was

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,819
funny uh two uh okay let's be clear one

184
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,199
and two were because I thought it was

185
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,500
funny three was because I want to be

186
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,419
very clear that when we finish this talk

187
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,580
when I'm finished telling you my dumb

188
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,380
stories when I tell you about how we

189
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,720
broke into that bank we stole that data

190
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,500
we did this oh by the way please add

191
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,479
with permission to the end of every one

192
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,819
of my stories right because you're like

193
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,560
like you stand up and you say well you

194
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,360
know what I was stealing money from this

195
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,919
bank by the way getting into the Vault

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,819
of a bank Scrooge McDuck lied to us

197
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,580
vaults are not that interesting I was

198
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,259
very very disappointed the first time I

199
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,319
went into one right or broke into one I

200
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,240
guess is the right way to say that

201
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,919
um one of the things I want you to do is

202
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,840
when you leave here I do not want you

203
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,580
walking out saying oh my God Kevin

204
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,400
scared the out of me I never want

205
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,680
to use apis because that is not my

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,460
message my message here is apis are the

207
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,099
way of the future right they are the way

208
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,900
we are moving most of our applications

209
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,840
in some level are using apis today and

210
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,780
that is not changing

211
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,840
the problem is most of the people that

212
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
are rolling out apis

213
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,720
don't understand the risks of what

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,220
they're doing

215
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,620
they don't understand the problems that

216
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,180
can happen because of the way they roll

217
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,000
out the API and let's be very clear

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,379
we're humans we suck at risk assessments

219
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,759
there's a real easy way to tell you this

220
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,639
I was out in Oklahoma right I was at a

221
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,659
b-sides decent

222
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,659
one of the guys who runs besides okay is

223
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,339
over there and I keep saying it's

224
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,399
b-sides okay like really not besides

225
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,120
great besides best I'm just saying right

226
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,300
besides decent mediocre but I'm out

227
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,040
there and I say in the audience right

228
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,880
I'm like hey how big of you are actively

229
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,040
afraid of sharks

230
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,440
like half the hands went up in the room

231
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,060
I'm like no I want to be very clear here

232
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,580
like you are actively like oh my God I

233
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,500
could be attacked by a shark and like

234
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,660
half the hands in the room stayed up

235
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,180
and I said you all understand you are in

236
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,279
a landlocked state

237
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,540
the only way a shark is attacking you is

238
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,940
if they are transporting it from one

239
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,940
aquarium to another aquarium and you run

240
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,660
into that truck

241
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
you guys know tornadoes you know yeah

242
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,680
yeah sharks spinning around the earth

243
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,620
right no what you should be afraid of is

244
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,500
cows and soda machines

245
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,620
why because cows and soda machines kill

246
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,860
more people a year than sharks do

247
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,040
cows will you up

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
they're big they're mean and people

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,540
think they're oh it's Betsy I'll Pat it

250
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,060
I'll tip it no that cow will knock you

251
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,580
over and the soda machines nobody has

252
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,320
any sympathy for people dying from a

253
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,420
soda machine right why did you die from

254
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,740
a certain like you get to the Pearly

255
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,180
Gates or whatever the image is you've

256
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,800
got in your head whatever okay I'm not

257
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,560
judging right and the people in the

258
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
afterlife say to you how'd you die and

259
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,620
they're like I was trying to steal

260
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,420
change from a soda machine I pulled it

261
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,240
on top of myself that's what happens

262
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,300
people like I really need a Mountain Dew

263
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,560
and they die

264
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,380
but Discovery Channel doesn't have soda

265
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,880
machine week

266
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,019
why because we suck at risk assessments

267
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,240
and as we go through all of the

268
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,700
different things with apis it's obvious

269
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,399
that we look at the benefits right

270
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,440
so let's talk about apis what is an API

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,019
it's a programmatic interface isn't that

272
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,279
fancy

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,500
right application programmatic interface

274
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,019
I like polysyllabic words

275
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,019
I do my favorite word is defenestration

276
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,700
do you guys know what it means to defend

277
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,380
or straight something

278
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,540
right throw it out the window here's

279
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,399
what I want to know what happened to the

280
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,140
English language that it decided it

281
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,180
needed a word specifically for throwing

282
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,920
something out a window

283
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,540
French Revolution is that really what it

284
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,380
was

285
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,060
you make it it sounds good we'll go with

286
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,940
it right like hey what do we what do you

287
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,500
call somebody getting thrown off a cliff

288
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,540
being thrown off a cliff what do you

289
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,860
call somebody being thrown through a

290
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,500
window they were defenestrated right it

291
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,480
just doesn't make sense to me my other

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,720
favorite word is onomatopoeia

293
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,339
what

294
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,680
I know exactly it doesn't matter what it

295
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,540
means canonicalization is another good

296
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,880
one what does it mean simplify to its

297
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,700
most unique form but it's not

298
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,040
right so application programmatic

299
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,480
interfaces these are interfaces

300
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,940
that you can interact with from your

301
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,560
application from your client from your

302
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,700
system from your device they are not

303
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,519
necessarily designed for a person to

304
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,019
interact with them

305
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,480
right and that's important to understand

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,700
but and I say it's important to

307
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,579
understand is because many times when we

308
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,019
test apis because that's what we do

309
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,440
right our job is to break things and so

310
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,560
we regularly test apis we are we have

311
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,660
been told by many companies that we are

312
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,579
one of the few pen test companies that

313
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,160
actually test apis

314
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,620
right I don't know that's true

315
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,540
I'd have talked to other pen testers

316
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,100
like how did you test that API I ran

317
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,959
nessus against it man you suck

318
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,180
but when we sorry man didn't mean

319
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,200
right

320
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,480
exactly that's the way it should be

321
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,120
right that should be a shirt

322
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,339
right but here's the problem when people

323
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,440
develop them when they build them

324
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,920
they assume that the other side is

325
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,720
another program

326
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,060
and so it can be trusted not to be

327
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,260
malicious

328
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,519
because those people have obviously

329
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,380
never run malware

330
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,260
right like oh people won't interact with

331
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,000
this I did

332
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,339
right so we have to think about this and

333
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,339
this has become a major portion of what

334
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,320
we do on the internet today

335
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,620
and mainly because of Integrations right

336
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,519
these apis there they are either data

337
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,079
sources or functionality

338
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,500
I can send a request the API and it will

339
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,120
do magic

340
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,860
and then give me a response of what the

341
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,959
results of that magic was like for

342
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:28,920
example

343
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,380
I want to do Payment Processing what do

344
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,200
I do I take the cardholder data I shove

345
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,320
it across to an API the API processes it

346
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,880
talks to the bank determines whether

347
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,440
they can pay for that does all that kind

348
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,660
of cool stuff and then I get a yep you

349
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,920
can accept the payment or you can't

350
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,180
right

351
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,360
that's an API that's functionality that

352
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,519
I don't want to build my I shouldn't tap

353
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,320
the microphone sorry to whoever was just

354
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
listening to that I am so sorry

355
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,380
um uh but I don't want to build my own

356
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,320
payment processor right my name is Kevin

357
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,360
not MasterCard

358
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,260
thank you

359
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,700
and they don't even really do whatever

360
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,880
you know what I mean okay but so I use

361
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
the functionality or there's data

362
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,500
sources right I want to build a system

363
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,680
that interacts with bank customers I'm

364
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,440
not part of the bank right and I want to

365
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,500
give them this other functionality and

366
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,260
so I'm going to call the banks API to

367
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,660
get access to customer record data

368
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,240
things like that we just saw it what

369
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,959
last week Optus the second biggest cell

370
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,620
phone provider in Australia had an API

371
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,880
of every customer's sign up data

372
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,360
including pictures of their ID

373
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,680
right

374
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,180
on an API that did not require

375
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,040
authentication exposed to the internet

376
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,079
an attacker stole a ton of data so you

377
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,639
get data from these things and then of

378
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,959
course you have the third parties right

379
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,460
we

380
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,800
[Music]

381
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,199
have a client portal

382
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,880
our client portal is where we deliver

383
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,500
reports we get the data from our

384
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,120
customer for the pen test things like

385
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,980
that and then when we generate the

386
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,440
report we will actually interact with

387
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,800
the customers ticketing systems API to

388
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
deliver findings to them they'll get our

389
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,540
normal report but we'll also issue

390
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,000
tickets into their jira system via API

391
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,980
so we have this third-party integration

392
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,800
right that is kind of nice so this is

393
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,199
good so what are the benefits here well

394
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,240
they're like bees

395
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,339
I like bees as a matter of fact my

396
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,660
daughter and I are going to be buying a

397
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,579
hive next march when they start selling

398
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,380
again putting bees in our yard which is

399
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,480
way more information than you need but

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,760
bees and apis in my mind are very

401
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,240
similar right one nobody believes a bee

402
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,579
should be able to fly most API code I've

403
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,880
looked at shouldn't be able to run

404
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,740
if you've ever written code you know I'm

405
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,060
right right and they go everywhere and

406
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
they spread pollen

407
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
right

408
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,019
it's true what do apis do they go

409
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,480
everywhere and they spread data and

410
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,360
everything and that can be good and can

411
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,500
be bad

412
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,720
just like bees if you've ever been stung

413
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,660
by a bee are you allergic to it that

414
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,440
sucks right it doesn't make the B bad

415
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,660
data being stolen from an API doesn't

416
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,540
necessarily make the API bad

417
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,480
right it's just part of the systems it's

418
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,860
part of the platform

419
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,380
okay so that's great and all but let's

420
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,120
start talking about some of the problems

421
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,940
because let's be blunt

422
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,279
the problems are what I break

423
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,800
this is my focus

424
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,940
I've been involved in I.T for way too

425
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,160
damn long

426
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,279
I started professionally in 1991.

427
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,079
I got my first job right out of high

428
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,279
school

429
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,740
and I wrote code

430
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,660
to help manage

431
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,020
the control systems for the power grid

432
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,559
right this should scare the crap out of

433
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,760
you

434
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,400
because that code is still running at

435
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,679
some utilities today

436
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,199
in 2022 yes

437
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,179
and let me be very clear I'm not that

438
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,480
good of a programmer now I sucked in

439
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,599
1991. right

440
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,359
but when I started doing I.T when I

441
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,320
started doing uh Building Systems I

442
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,480
built the system Hey Kevin we need a

443
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,039
bulletin board system some of you are

444
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,580
old enough to remember that right

445
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,980
okay you have a BBs

446
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,140
set up a landtastic network from

447
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,140
artisoft run coax cables with BNC

448
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,820
connectors I'm old

449
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,260
right

450
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,120
and you managed it did I think about

451
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,480
security no I didn't

452
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,179
when I started writing code for other

453
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,919
companies when I started deploying

454
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,960
systems for other companies I wasn't

455
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,380
focused on security why

456
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,340
because bluntly I didn't care

457
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,500
and this is sad because when I was 14 I

458
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,600
got involved in freaking

459
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,080
red boxes blue boxes right

460
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,700
I played around with all that stuff of

461
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,820
course I never did anything illegal

462
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,160
I think I was doing 95 yesterday as I

463
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,980
went past that cop but that's not true

464
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,520
my car was doing 95. it drives I don't

465
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,919
but

466
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
we look at these systems and then as we

467
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,600
start to roll out we have to understand

468
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,700
the risks and I said that right I talked

469
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,179
about sharks cows soda machines

470
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,039
if we don't understand the risks that

471
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,080
we're dealing with and I've got a few

472
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,580
here and I want to be very clear I said

473
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,980
some example risks I want to point that

474
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,400
out this is not a comprehensive list

475
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
and

476
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,200
all of these risks depend on what your

477
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,580
system does if your API is an API that

478
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,240
sends smiley emoji of the day

479
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,679
you probably don't have massive risks

480
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,440
if every single time I call your API it

481
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,039
returns a cool Snapple fact from the can

482
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,860
cap right do they still do that

483
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,179
please you top it off there's a little

484
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,580
fact on the top of the cam or bottle or

485
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,200
whatever the hell it's called right yes

486
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
I got a yes so you could build an API

487
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,020
that gave snapple facts right not a lot

488
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,100
of risk

489
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,799
but if you're building an API for the

490
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,780
open banking infrastructure to help the

491
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,580
unbanked in the

492
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,799
12th world countries I made that number

493
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,059
up

494
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,799
right

495
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,260
and your interface is dealing with

496
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,440
people's livelihoods your level of risk

497
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,620
is higher and we talk about uh privacy

498
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,020
availability yes availability it's one

499
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,400
of the Triad and for some reason

500
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,640
security always forgets it right but

501
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,860
privacy is the first one privacy is dead

502
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,980
but so are mainframes

503
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,500
and many companies still have them right

504
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,100
you know what's Dead next passwords

505
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,400
oh yeah passwords are out by this time

506
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,140
next year nobody's going to have a

507
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,340
password

508
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,980
 I

509
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,919
your password's still going to be winter

510
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,600
2023 but with a capital w

511
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,039
privacy

512
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,620
is crazy and a lot of people don't care

513
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,919
about it right I actually don't I'm not

514
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,419
a very private person what do you want

515
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,919
to know about me

516
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,660
right

517
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,780
I was diagnosed with OCD I probably have

518
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,100
Tourette's

519
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,360
I'm just not going to go to the doctor

520
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,740
to find out because there's no treatment

521
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,660
for it you want my medical records I get

522
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,059
migraines I've got bad lungs this is all

523
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,799
being recorded

524
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
my social security numbers on the

525
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,919
internet

526
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,740
it is you can Google it

527
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,539
luckily though when I turned 18 I

528
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,460
changed my name to Kevin Johnson and

529
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,340
that's common so people can't find me

530
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,440
I'm not as cool as John strand who's

531
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,940
also named after an underwear model

532
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,360
insurrectionist but

533
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,640
by the way today is John strand's

534
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,260
birthday so if you could tweet him happy

535
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,660
birthday I'd appreciate it

536
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,559
um

537
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,919
but privacy is important and we say that

538
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,620
right but we share everything we want on

539
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,179
Facebook

540
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,400
you know what privacy is right

541
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,679
it's the cookie pop-up that says we use

542
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,020
cookies please click here that is the

543
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,880
main effect of gdpr

544
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,700
pop-ups something we fought for years

545
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,760
not to have on websites gdpr now

546
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,460
mandates it oh I feel safer

547
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,740
but even though I'm a very open person

548
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,020
right I talk about whatever you want to

549
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,700
know ask me a question I'll tell you

550
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,260
right

551
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,659
I also recognize that privacy is

552
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,159
important

553
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,900
I don't care if you know where I Bank

554
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,520
VyStar by the way

555
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,539
right

556
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,880
but I do care if you're actively

557
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,980
tracking everything I purchase

558
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,200
you don't need to know that I bought

559
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,500
that beehive you don't need to know that

560
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,240
I bought bees it's weird to be able to

561
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,320
say that you bought bees

562
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,419
you don't pet them

563
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,179
right but privacy is important and

564
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,440
here's the issue and the reason I bring

565
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,820
this up is when we start talking about

566
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,640
apis is we start to expose these data

567
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,260
points these functionalities these

568
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,960
transactions what we end up doing is we

569
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,360
end up not understanding what should be

570
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,860
private

571
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,240
I mean it's really easy for some people

572
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,400
go well I'm under a HIPAA

573
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,200
but that person who says I'm under HIPAA

574
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,059
probably spells it with two P's because

575
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,919
they're an idiot

576
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,860
right or the other side right we have no

577
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,140
HIPAA data really you have no HIPAA data

578
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,840
none none whatsoever nope do you offer

579
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,520
Insurance to your employees yes of

580
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,940
course we do you have HIPAA data

581
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,440
because when I filled out my insurance

582
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,179
forms I gave them pre-existing

583
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,059
conditions which meant my company has

584
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,400
access to records of my pre-existing

585
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
conditions well my company is not a hip

586
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,220
HIPAA those hiva covered entities well

587
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,080
my company is not a HIPAA covered entity

588
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
I have HIPAA data

589
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,960
I may have to worry about the privacy of

590
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,080
that data plus what is private let me

591
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,780
talk about pen testing I go break into a

592
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,100
company

593
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,520
four years ago I break into a company I

594
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,679
go wild

595
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,059
I took over all the machines you

596
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,260
actually have to make that face when

597
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
you're doing it

598
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,260
what you do is that bypasses Windows

599
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,520
Defender and crowdstrike and um

600
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,440
it's just how you do it right if you

601
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,000
want to get past Sentinel one you lift

602
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,700
your left leg and hop it's really weird

603
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,100
I don't know why that works must be a

604
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,179
back door

605
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,799
so

606
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,080
I got in trouble on Twitter from like

607
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
people because I found a back door and

608
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,020
to log me in

609
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,640
I did and I took a picture of it and

610
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
shared it on Twitter because I was near

611
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
their Boston office and they have a back

612
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,460
door that says log me in please use

613
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,140
front door so

614
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,179
I shared it I actually had people say

615
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,820
Kevin sharing zero days is wrong and I'm

616
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,620
like you're a

617
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,720
like look at the picture oh we thought

618
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,360
that was a joke yes it was that was the

619
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,700
back door but

620
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,100
when we start to look at this data we

621
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,200
start to evaluate it right if you get

622
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,440
access to my systems now not only do I

623
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,200
have vulnerability data for my customers

624
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,780
but because most of their staff work

625
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,980
from home

626
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,080
I have vulnerability data about their

627
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,360
home network

628
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,960
because it is hard for me at the testing

629
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,740
process to differentiate

630
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,900
if you set up your VPN that everything

631
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,840
on that that employees Network at home

632
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,840
is on your corporate Network I'm going

633
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,820
to see it

634
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,280
now I'm smart enough well that's not

635
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,220
true Aaron is smart enough

636
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,140
that he knows not to hack that home

637
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,659
infrastructure but we still have the

638
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:10,980
data

639
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,919
if we compromise your system and you

640
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,140
have we want it's in one place and they

641
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,539
had a Wiki I don't know why but it was a

642
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,760
Wiki that every employee had their own

643
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,659
section and they were encouraged to

644
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,220
share their personal information on that

645
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,360
Wiki put your bank account information

646
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,000
there put your medical records there use

647
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
this for your own record and they were

648
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,779
encouraged not because the company with

649
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:37,020
some evil capitalist bastard no they

650
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,640
were just trying to help their staff

651
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,039
right and they thought this was a good

652
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,539
idea they were wrong

653
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,340
and we got that data

654
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,620
and I'm like oh you're subscribing to oh

655
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,900
and I write like

656
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,880
these are the things these are privacy

657
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,400
concerns and apis make them harder

658
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,039
because you don't know what data is

659
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,440
coming back from that

660
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,140
we've tested some apis you hit it like

661
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,940
we just tested this one oh my God it was

662
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,400
so fun we just did this test right and

663
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
we're testing the system and we hit this

664
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,600
API and you're just like hi my name is

665
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,700
Kevin and they're like oh you must be

666
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,620
Kevin blah blah blah here's your social

667
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,000
security number here's all of your

668
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,620
records here's all it is could you

669
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,699
please authenticate now

670
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm not making that one up

671
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,659
that was an API built in 2022

672
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,779
right we should know

673
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,880
we'll talk about that in a second

674
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,100
the other thing is availability

675
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,820
right we always forget that the a in CIA

676
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,059
doesn't stand for agency it well it does

677
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,799
in some cases

678
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,620
but it stands for availability right the

679
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,900
CIA Triad for security confidentiality

680
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,559
integrity and availability availability

681
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,620
so that API you call that you make

682
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,720
how does it do load balancing

683
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,480
what happens if you get back a response

684
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,220
from it you weren't expecting what do

685
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,480
you do

686
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,919
what happens if you call it it doesn't

687
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,140
answer do you stop processing do you

688
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,779
handle stuff right

689
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,720
how do you deal with that and then

690
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,159
security many of us don't think about

691
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,059
that

692
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,240
right but for some organizations

693
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,440
availability is actually the most

694
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,539
important of the three remember I said

695
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,299
depending on the organization you're

696
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:30,799
what you care about matters

697
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,779
for a manufacturing company

698
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,000
there's manufacturing millions of

699
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,880
dollars of equipment a second I'm

700
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,659
exaggerating or it's expensive

701
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,460
availability is probably the most

702
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,820
important aspect of the system

703
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,000
and we have seen manufacturing companies

704
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,720
networks their OT Network brought to its

705
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,919
knees

706
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,340
because an API that was designed for

707
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,580
kpis yes I used those two acronyms

708
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,020
together I worked hard to get them to

709
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,900
fit right key performance indicators I

710
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,940
know I'm a manager now

711
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,299
I know what kpi stands for

712
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,299
and this is a Manufacturing Company

713
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,200
their system is calling an API to give

714
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,940
metrics of how much they're producing

715
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,200
how effective they are and everything

716
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,480
else like that and that metric system

717
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,279
that sounded stupid

718
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,220
because we use inches here but um I know

719
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,020
that's not the same

720
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,059
um but that metric system nobody thought

721
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,440
was important because it had no

722
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,020
sensitive data right all it said was we

723
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,580
produced 10 of those we produced 10 of

724
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,320
those we produced another 10. oh we did

725
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,260
11 right that's it

726
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,020
that API went down

727
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,080
it went down due to somebody Port

728
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,200
scanning the server it was on

729
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,240
if your system Falls over from a port

730
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,419
scan you suck

731
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,779
and many of you do sorry

732
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,159
right

733
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,740
the API went down because of a port scan

734
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,140
the manufacturing equipment stopped

735
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,380
making

736
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,900
they couldn't do it why because they

737
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
would call the API and it would fail

738
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,580
look at the colonial pipeline

739
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,799
oh they got hit with rent somewhere now

740
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,299
I want to be very clear I don't do IR

741
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,820
anymore I didn't work this incident I am

742
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,779
basing this off of stuff I read publicly

743
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,059
they got hit with ransomware

744
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,640
on their corporate network not their OT

745
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,860
Network the pipeline wasn't ransomware

746
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,039
nobody encrypted the Natural Gas

747
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,320
you base 64 in code natural gas it's

748
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,158
just the way you do

749
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,140
that's not right

750
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,820
their corporate Network got hit with

751
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,220
eight uh with with apis they got apis

752
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,340
everywhere they got hit with ransomware

753
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,980
and they shut the pipeline down

754
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,200
not because it was encrypted but because

755
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,779
it couldn't reach the apis that they did

756
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,940
for accounting

757
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,799
they shut down the pipeline because they

758
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,840
didn't know how to get paid

759
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,000
I have a simple answer here

760
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,919
gas is free for a week

761
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,080
oh no we've got a business

762
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,419
your profit margins like four thousand

763
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,360
percent I know I'm exaggerating

764
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,700
no I'm not I maybe not I don't know

765
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,279
right but they shut it down because they

766
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,320
couldn't reach stuff not because the

767
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,419
pipeline was damaged

768
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,600
we're not talking Norway here that's not

769
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,340
a joke

770
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,500
there's a hole in the damn thing there

771
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,120
that's a good reason to shut one down

772
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,520
not because you're a counting API is

773
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,140
offline

774
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,240


775
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,799
I believe that we should be allowed to

776
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,840
use in way more emails

777
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,919
I really do

778
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,240
you know how much more effective

779
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,980
security would be is if we could throat

780
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,620
punch just one random person per report

781
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,700
right be great did you fix it no work

782
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,700
you'll fix it next time won't ya

783
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,860
I'm a violent person

784
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,539
I live in Florida it's expected

785
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,299
so God that's awful Florida man I

786
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,700
wrestled an alligator when I was a kid I

787
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,960
saw an alligator wrestling thing where

788
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,700
the alligator won

789
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,919
it was awesome

790
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,840
it really was and I'm not talking like

791
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,600
oh it was gory I'm not I'm not Aaron but

792
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,179
um he likes horror movies

793
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,980
the guys like wrestling the alligator

794
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,600
and his hand slipped and the alligator

795
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,700
went whack and got him now with an

796
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,840
alligator have you ever been bitten by

797
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,299
an alligator it's only happened once and

798
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,039
um I've been shot at more times than

799
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,679
I've been bitten that's weird but

800
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,840
if you're ever like the alligator snaps

801
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,240
and then they let go and they grab again

802
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,039
and then they try to do the death roll

803
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,100
right so this dude it was amazing this

804
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,860
and I want to talk about like like State

805
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,020
of Mind the alligator jumped onto his

806
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,600
arm and the dude immediately flattened

807
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,700
himself well he flattened himself and oh

808
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,960
he flattened himself on top of the

809
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,220
alligator so he couldn't bite a second

810
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,000
time

811
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,039
who thinks of that

812
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,200
like me so I don't get it grabs my arm

813
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,340
I'll be like

814
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,380
that's what's gonna happen

815
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,539
that dude understood risk see I made it

816
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,039
relevant so other security concerns

817
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,679
we got lots of problems here with party

818
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,380
breaches we got data Integrity Access

819
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,840
Control right

820
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,240
these are three things that are pretty

821
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,940
important so Access Control

822
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,679
we put up a lot of little Badges and

823
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,059
things like that I think that's good you

824
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,120
guys see the IBM office

825
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,360
where they had a badge printed for a cat

826
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,760
that hung out in the parking lot

827
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm dead serious

828
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,960
had the cat's face on it everything else

829
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,640
like that I told that story now you know

830
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,260
as well as I do that that badge had

831
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,880
default access to that building right

832
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,500
you know it

833
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,779
so wild damn cat I don't know if that's

834
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,279
really a feral feral is probably the

835
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,860
right word right a feral cat they put an

836
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,480
IBM badge on it this is all over the

837
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,340
internet right I tell this story about

838
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,200
this badge somebody comes to me he's

839
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,000
like Kevin I found the picture of the

840
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,940
cat it was a different cat which means

841
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,480
there are two badges at IBM that allow

842
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
cats in

843
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,100
this is nuts your apis are the same way

844
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,340
all cats all the time

845
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,760
most apis that we test have no concept

846
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,179
of authentication or authorization

847
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,760
they assume and you know what happens

848
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,140
when you assume right it makes an ass

849
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,700
out of you and you because I spell it

850
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,880
different

851
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,279
they assume that was a bad one I don't

852
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,980
laugh at that one that one sucked and um

853
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,720
that one's almost as bad as do you know

854
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
why Walmart wasn't hacked

855
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,740
they're not a Target but

856
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,179
they assume that when you call the API

857
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:02,820
you are authorized to call that API

858
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,399
right so it's like oh hey you knew how

859
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,860
to call me you must be the right person

860
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,599
this is like my dating life if you

861
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,919
called me up it was awesome

862
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,219
that's why I'm never divorcing my wife

863
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,080
I tricked one person to want to be with

864
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,060
me periodically I'm never risking that

865
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,879
one again but apis most of them don't

866
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,080
have any form of authentication

867
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,560
authorization or worse in my opinion

868
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
they have an idea of authentication

869
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,239
authorization but the application that

870
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,699
calls them has a static set of

871
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,280
credentials that the app calls with so

872
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,820
no matter who the user is of the app if

873
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,040
I'm using it or if he's using it or if

874
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,918
she's using it the app is calling the

875
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,619
API with the same set of credentials and

876
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,260
in my head that's worse than an

877
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,719
unauthora unauthorized an unauthorized

878
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,839
BET unauthenticated right system and

879
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,280
people like but Kevin the other one's

880
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,800
unauthenticated I'm like right but if

881
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,599
you go to the developers and say hey is

882
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,680
there authentication on this thing

883
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,900
they'll be like no right they

884
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
understand that

885
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,980
they might be wrong they might not

886
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,260
understand the risk but they at least

887
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,540
will document the fact they will answer

888
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,720
the question on the other one you say

889
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,160
the numbers do you do authentication and

890
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
authorization yes

891
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,480
we absolutely do

892
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,579
really yes

893
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,500
is it one set of credentials for every

894
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,960
app yes oh

895
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,839
right like then they realize but you

896
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,520
know that check box how many people here

897
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
have been on part of the procurement

898
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,760
process where they give you that

899
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,099
spreadsheet of questions that are all

900
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,200
 stupid

901
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,040
right do you do authentication yes

902
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,020
let me ask you a question how was I

903
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,980
authenticated this morning

904
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,300
first name last name

905
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,099
right how many of you know that I'm

906
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,579
Kevin Johnson

907
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,619
how do you know I'm a Kevin Johnson

908
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,900
right I say that in class every once in

909
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,280
a while the people like oh I saw a

910
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
picture of you online I have an

911
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,359
identical twin brother

912
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,099
I do

913
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,540
sadly I'm the evil twin

914
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,400
nobody authenticated me I walked up I

915
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,660
said hi I'm Kevin Johnson they hand me a

916
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,800
badge

917
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,619
and they know me some of them

918
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,440
right but I could be my brother would

919
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,980
you know Mark

920
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,800
yeah that exactly he's got a beard

921
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,820
mustache it's really weird

922
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,420
which you would think would be the evil

923
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,700
twin but it's not

924
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,560
so access control is one of the places

925
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,859
we fail quite often for apis we also see

926
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,740
the problem with data integrity

927
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,399
right

928
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,140
one of the main reasons we spent spin

929
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,960
outs spew out apis all over the place

930
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,000
is to handle data at some level whether

931
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,740
it's a transaction processing data or

932
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,839
storing data whatever it is

933
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,079
so what format is the data that you sent

934
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,700
I just had a customer we're doing a

935
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,260
scoping call we're doing we got the sow

936
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,599
to them they like the sow they think

937
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,040
they're going to sign but they got one

938
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,300
important question

939
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,460
this happened yesterday

940
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,440
like okay what's your one important

941
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,700
question it's weird to me that there's

942
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,880
only one but that's okay

943
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,079
and they're like

944
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,820
your output

945
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,099
can you put it in the format that Archer

946
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,140
will input

947
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,700
like great do you know what format

948
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,220
Archer does as an input and the guy's

949
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,900
like no

950
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,140
I'm like we can put in that format

951
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,520
like I don't know how to answer that

952
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,680
question at that point right like

953
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,260
yes we can generate our output in a

954
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,060
format that you can use but you have to

955
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,339
give us that format you have to document

956
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,820
it right when I worked at Alamo I was

957
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,440
one of the developers building the quick

958
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,780
rent system yes that means if you rented

959
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,220
a car from Alamo there's a good chance

960
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,960
your information went through my code

961
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,200
I'll apologize now

962
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,020
and when we talk to the Mainframe

963
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,180
we sent a string

964
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,520
it was a fixed width string

965
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,160
the first four bytes was some ID the

966
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,380
next 12 bytes was the first name the

967
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,599
next 15 bytes was the last making this

968
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,579
up right like the the numbers but this

969
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,160
is how we did it and if you needed to do

970
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,500
a change in that data format like when

971
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,599
we started offering uh I almost said

972
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,920
high chairs

973
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,420
um

974
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,220
car seats thank you how could I not

975
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,859
think of that word right it's in a car

976
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,780
and you sit on it right but we'll go

977
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,060
with that so in the car seat we started

978
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,460
over it so we had to add

979
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,780
a field

980
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,460
and it was a binary field so that should

981
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,220
be easy right

982
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,099
but here's how we did it I stood up

983
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,079
and I went Alan

984
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,300
and like three Cube over Allen stood up

985
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,400
he was the Mainframe developer

986
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,720
he was older

987
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,439
you knew that

988
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,359
I need to add

989
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,780
damn it I did it I car seat and he went

990
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,960
okay and he sat down and I kept standing

991
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,920
because I knew it would be about a

992
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,200
minute and then he popped up he goes how

993
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,260
about 37 bytes in we'll expand it by one

994
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,420
byte and you put a zero or one there

995
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,640
okay great one means they want it zero

996
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
means they don't want it yeah that works

997
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,380
okay cool when can you get it into uat I

998
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,359
could probably get that into uat Monday

999
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,940
great cool I'll have my stuff in the uat

1000
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,160
by Monday as well and then we sat down

1001
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,020
and we started working on it that was

1002
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,240
our ticket tracking system

1003
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,780
Alan and me yelling over cue balls as

1004
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,700
groundhogs or Gophers what is that right

1005
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,839
we're not talking about the Gopher

1006
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,300
protocol that thing was awesome

1007
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm old

1008
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,940
that's data integrity

1009
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,280
because if he put his code into

1010
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,800
production before I did mine

1011
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,440
right here's the problem with apis that

1012
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,119
are exposed to the internet how do you

1013
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,099
yell at Alan

1014
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,380
you find Swagger documentation or a

1015
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,900
postman collection or you email them or

1016
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,940
chat with somebody and you tend to get

1017
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,800
somebody who's customer service and they

1018
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,820
don't know what the hell you're talking

1019
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,560
about and they've got to transfer you

1020
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,099
over right we pass data back and forth

1021
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,200
so the format is important how do you

1022
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,579
deal with the format how do you know

1023
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:22,560
what's the right format how do you go

1024
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,740
and make sure that the that you're

1025
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,140
sending it to somewhere you trust

1026
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,420
how do you know where they're hosting it

1027
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,760
I've always enjoyed people that use the

1028
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,640
bitly links I shortened my link by

1029
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,920
putting it on bitly really you know

1030
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,839
bitly is a Libyan domain name

1031
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,579
now I'm not saying it's untrustworthy

1032
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm just saying do you know

1033
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,579
when you send that stuff out there

1034
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,680
right how do you handle that

1035
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,960
and then the final thing we want to talk

1036
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,520
about

1037
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,640
I think I'm good on time okay I don't

1038
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,380
know which of these clocks is right that

1039
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,040
one's flashing like crazy right

1040
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,200
and my watch is like oh you're walking a

1041
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,119
lot that's good because my watch says

1042
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,320
I'm fat

1043
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,180
you know you're fat when you get out of

1044
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,460
the car and your watch celebrates that

1045
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,420
you became active

1046
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,760
that happened yesterday I got out of the

1047
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,460
car I drove up from Jacksonville I park

1048
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,960
at the hotel I get out of the car and

1049
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,220
then watch you like

1050
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,220
you fat ass you're moving

1051
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,260
it didn't phrase it that way but it

1052
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,480
really was it was what it meant right

1053
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,540
the biggest problem that we see that

1054
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,280
people are unprepared for

1055
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,300
right

1056
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,339
his third party breach

1057
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,680
let's talk about Target

1058
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,020
I I like to talk about Target because of

1059
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,220
their name

1060
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,380
like you named yourself something people

1061
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,040
shoot at

1062
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,359
and then you got really popular

1063
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,760
because let's be blunt right you can't

1064
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,800
go to Target and not buy more than you

1065
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,940
meant to buy

1066
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,859
I don't know how it happens

1067
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,320
you walk in you get a cart that's your

1068
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,940
first mistake

1069
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,700
and you push it around I have issues so

1070
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,079
I have a pattern I have to go around

1071
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,800
drives my wife crazy my wife's the only

1072
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,420
semi-normal person in the house

1073
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,280
both of my daughters have Tourette's

1074
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,420
I told them both this is great you get

1075
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,980
to just rent me out and

1076
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,140
nobody can judge you

1077
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,759
I'm a very supportive father

1078
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,079
I have twitches and things like that

1079
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,480
right we go to dinner and the waiter or

1080
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,940
waitress comes by and Brenna Sarah and I

1081
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,440
are all twitching away and Denise just

1082
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,700
sitting there calm and they look at her

1083
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,899
and go I'm so sorry

1084
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,859
she gets lots of sympathy that way it

1085
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,160
works

1086
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,119
but when we go to Target right how many

1087
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,500
people here know about Target getting

1088
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,540
breached

1089
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,920
right

1090
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,900
how many people can tell me the HVAC

1091
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,220
company that was actually breached

1092
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:09,240
because you know Target wasn't right

1093
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,460
yeah it was a vendor it was a vendor

1094
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,319
that managed their hvacs and again

1095
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,180
didn't work the incident I'm talking

1096
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,899
about public information

1097
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,420
it was a vendor that managed their HVAC

1098
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,140
systems that vendor got popped that

1099
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,380
vendor had access to an accounting API

1100
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,640
that allowed them to submit invoices and

1101
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,260
expenses and things like that

1102
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,000
do you know what else the accounting

1103
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,460
systems had access to

1104
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,280
the point of sale Network now I don't

1105
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,319
mean to pick on anybody but of course

1106
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,480
the accounting systems have access at

1107
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,099
some level to the point of sale Network

1108
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,980
why because point of sale systems are

1109
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,780
accounting

1110
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,819
because they count no no you know what I

1111
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,619
mean

1112
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,060
and that's how they got pop but nobody

1113
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,339
knows about that what about Delta how

1114
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,079
many people got notified from Delta that

1115
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,640
your information got stolen a few years

1116
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,940
ago

1117
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,140
okay thank you very much for making me

1118
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,880
not feel like I'm the only dude that got

1119
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,280
hit right right do you know how Delta

1120
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,220
got had oh wait they didn't

1121
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,420
their chat provider got hacked they had

1122
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,520
an API that enabled them to deploy a

1123
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,440
chat system to their website to make it

1124
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,119
easier for customers to get information

1125
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,060
and as somebody who uses Delta all the

1126
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,319
time and I want to be very clear I don't

1127
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,000
care what airline unless you do like

1128
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,980
Southwest or Allegiant or something like

1129
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,300
that but

1130
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,420
all yeah I was picking on you and

1131
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,760
um all Airlines suck until you get

1132
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,020
status

1133
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,300
and all status means is that when you

1134
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,740
get bumped from a flight they'll help

1135
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,540
you better right that's it

1136
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,819
it also means you flew around way too

1137
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,640
damn much okay people like oh man you

1138
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,619
have status on an airline you must be so

1139
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:55,859
cool no I'm nerdy and in a tube way too

1140
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,280
often with people I don't know

1141
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,020
and by the way if you're ever on a

1142
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,780
flight and I'm on it get off

1143
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,280
there's going to be a problem I was just

1144
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,660
on a fight they pulled the guy off on in

1145
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,040
handcuffs

1146
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,200
right I'm never the cause of the problem

1147
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,780
but I was in two fist fights on planes

1148
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,880
and I want to be very clear when I say I

1149
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,740
was in a fist fight I mean I was

1150
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,020
physically located between the two

1151
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,599
people that were punching each other

1152
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,599
one guy was in the row ahead of me the

1153
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,460
other guy was in the row behind me I

1154
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,020
don't know how the those two guys

1155
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,940
started talking

1156
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,060
it was a red eye I woke up and they were

1157
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,700
fighting in the space between the top of

1158
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,660
the chairs and the suitcases

1159
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,339
I didn't know what was going on I'm like

1160
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,720
oh

1161
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,040
crazy

1162
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,900
I just have bad trips on flights like

1163
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,920
the one

1164
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,780
I got on a plane once and I got up and

1165
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,099
there was a dude I swear to you the

1166
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,300
story is true

1167
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,280
I get on the plane guys in the window

1168
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
I'll see I'm in the window what do you

1169
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,540
say hi sir I'm in the window

1170
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,280
if I if you were the dude in the aisle

1171
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,660
and I said hey I'm in the window what

1172
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,220
would you do

1173
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,260
you get up right right the guy says you

1174
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,619
have a room

1175
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,119
so put them back in the overhead I say

1176
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,880
to the guy sir I've got the window seat

1177
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,819
and the guy goes you have room

1178
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:16,980
so I said sir I don't mean to be rude

1179
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,540
because you could be stuck in this tube

1180
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,460
with this dude for six hours right you

1181
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,680
got to be polite so Isaiah sir I'm very

1182
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,900
sorry but is it possible that you could

1183
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,960
get up so I can get in and I swear to

1184
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,339
you this is a true story the guy looked

1185
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:30,960
me in the face and said

1186
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,380
I don't have any legs you can move me if

1187
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,060
you want

1188
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,480
and I looked down and he didn't

1189
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,460
so I didn't know what to say

1190
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,619
so I heard come out of my mouth a lot of

1191
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:45,000
times things come out of my mouth and

1192
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,800
then I realize all I heard coming my

1193
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,200
mouth was you're right I have room I

1194
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,859
didn't know what else to say like I

1195
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,180
it was the awful it was awful right but

1196
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,319
one of the things we have to be prepared

1197
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,500
for right nobody knows the chat provider

1198
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,839
see it's relevant Nobody Knows the chat

1199
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,480
provider that got hit

1200
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,060
you bite but you don't you know Delta

1201
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,220
got hit why because Delta's the name let

1202
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,319
me ask you a question how many apis does

1203
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:14,819
your company call

1204
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,099
you don't know right yeah lots

1205
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,839
how prepared are you for when that

1206
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,460
company gets popped

1207
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,900
is it your name or their name that's

1208
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,760
going to be on the site let me very

1209
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,040
clear John strand told me years ago it's

1210
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,260
actually why I switched to use Google as

1211
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,319
our email solution for the company

1212
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,599
because John said this

1213
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,920
Kevin

1214
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,260
everybody gets hacked it's true right

1215
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,339
the NSA got hacked their entire job is

1216
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:43,619
to hack other people

1217
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,980
they got popped if the NSA can't keep

1218
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,579
stuff secret what the am I gonna do

1219
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,859
I'm a nerd that barely made it out of

1220
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,660
high school

1221
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,420
where'd you get your degree achs what's

1222
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,599
that Atlantic Community High School I'm

1223
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,359
sorry diploma but

1224
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,859
I suppose make jokes like that at a

1225
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:08,220
college I don't know and um

1226
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,920
he said when security is his mail server

1227
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,359
gets popped

1228
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,460
do you want the article to say security

1229
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,160
as his mail server got popped or do you

1230
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,619
want the article to say Google's mail

1231
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,359
servers got popped and security has

1232
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,400
happened to be on there

1233
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,660
second one

1234
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,460
right and I don't mean that's not really

1235
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,579
why we switched it right but the reality

1236
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,099
is if there's two parties in a system

1237
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,140
one of those parties his name is going

1238
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,880
to be on that article

1239
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,980
is it yours or theirs

1240
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,960
on top of that

1241
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,240
even if it's their name it's your

1242
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,819
customers it's your people it's your

1243
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:45,900
data

1244
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,940
how do you handle that because I'll tell

1245
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,560
you right now if you're working with an

1246
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,540
API let's I don't know you're using the

1247
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,240
HubSpot apis right and HubSpot gets

1248
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,500
popped

1249
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,180
do you think HubSpot is going to let you

1250
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,099
talk to their IR people to find out what

1251
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:00,119
happened

1252
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,520
no

1253
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,740
so are you prepared for that third party

1254
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,140
breach that gets access to your data

1255
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,940
are you prepared for the third party

1256
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,000
breach that then pushes malicious code

1257
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,040
into your system

1258
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,140
because your system is taking data from

1259
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,578
that API and displaying it

1260
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,740
and the reality here though is all of

1261
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,660
this stuff sucks all of this stuff is

1262
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,960
bad apis will kill us all you know your

1263
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,339
life expectancy is two minutes

1264
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,720
it is but Every Breath You Take resets

1265
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,119
the counter

1266
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,000
apis suck

1267
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,560
but they actually make our systems

1268
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,520
better

1269
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,099
in many cases we are able to leverage

1270
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,839
organizations that have better

1271
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,720
experience at the thing they do so that

1272
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,119
we can focus on the thing that we do

1273
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,319
right

1274
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,260
I'll put secure ideas

1275
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,260
HubSpot was a purposeful example we use

1276
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,540
HubSpot for our systems we use HubSpot

1277
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,180
as our CRM I'm not revealing Secret

1278
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,640
Sauce here by the way the secret sauce

1279
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,920
is just thousand island dressing okay I

1280
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,660
worked at McDonald's a long time it's a

1281
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,560
little bit more ketchup

1282
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,240
we use HubSpot you can find that out by

1283
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,099
going to our website

1284
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,140
you can look at the HTML that comes down

1285
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,480
and know that was generated by HubSpot

1286
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,680
okay

1287
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,780
and I like that

1288
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,680
because it means unlike five years ago

1289
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,740
when we built our site using Gatsby and

1290
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,260
react and we deployed it through GitHub

1291
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,680
using AWS to push it out

1292
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,480
we don't have to worry about whether the

1293
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,040
website's running right

1294
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,599
we push that off to somebody who does it

1295
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:43,980
better than we do

1296
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,900
and then we focused on security we

1297
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,819
focused on our clients we focused on the

1298
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,619
advisory Services we focus on the pen

1299
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,780
testing right

1300
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,660
apis are going to make us better

1301
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,540
we just have to understand the risks we

1302
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,119
expose by using them we have to

1303
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,180
understand the risks we exhibit

1304
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,680
within them

1305
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,540
test your

1306
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,880
please note I did not say higher secure

1307
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,220
ideas to test your

1308
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,680
you can don't get me wrong I'm a greedy

1309
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,380
capitalist I've got 26 people that

1310
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,319
demand a paycheck every two weeks it's

1311
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:22,500
ridiculous and they want benefits

1312
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,140
health insurance whatever

1313
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,799
right

1314
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,180
but the reality is

1315
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,000
you can do what we do

1316
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,920
and we'll help you

1317
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,800
just ask we're not lawyers we don't bill

1318
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,660
you for questions we don't bill you when

1319
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,160
we think of you

1320
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,500
you want to test your own apis call us

1321
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,839
up talk to us hell we're doing a class

1322
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,240
through anti-siphon especially on API

1323
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,160
testing go take it and that's not a

1324
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,359
sales pitch I believe it's one of the

1325
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,520
pay what you can of course is because we

1326
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,319
want all of our courses to pay pay what

1327
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,240
you can which means free if that's all

1328
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,380
you can pay

1329
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,880
and by the way you don't have to tell us

1330
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,960
why you need it for free

1331
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,359
but ask Hey Kevin what do I do here oh

1332
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,940
this is what you do okay

1333
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,680
thank you very much any questions I

1334
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,000
think that clock is right right I got

1335
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,920
nine minutes am I right

1336
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,319
about that three minutes damn it that

1337
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,599
clock's not right

1338
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,559
questions yes sir

1339
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,280
okay so what can you do with your devis

1340
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,980
head-up teams to proactively help the

1341
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,960
security of your apis first off stop

1342
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,480
working with devsecop teams start

1343
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,400
working with developers nothing wrong

1344
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,020
with devsecops I'm not saying that's

1345
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,540
wrong but we focus too much on security

1346
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,760
right what we need to do is have

1347
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,980
developers understand what they're doing

1348
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,500
right what I would recommend doing is

1349
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,480
ensuring that whoever is developing this

1350
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,339
code whether it's a third party or you

1351
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:03,059
that they have unit tests focused on

1352
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,380
security

1353
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,720
make sure that as they build these apis

1354
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,119
they understand the architecture of what

1355
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,099
they're doing and who's calling what's

1356
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,960
there those are the two things I'd start

1357
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
with make sense

1358
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,400
okay

1359
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,339
keep pointed somewhere over here

1360
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,619
oh I've got goodies to give out I forgot

1361
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,839
damn it I forgot the goodies

1362
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,220
sorry

1363
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,440
what do I do with this again

1364
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,300
yeah okay

1365
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,599
so because you asked the first question

1366
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,640
who just asked thank you here
