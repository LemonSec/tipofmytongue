1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970
are you all right we should be good to
go because you can stand up owning the

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:49,980
easier it is for everybody and everybody
else last time the last year and down

3
00:00:49,980 --> 00:01:13,500
the west and think that you're
interesting that that that choice was

4
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,830
made because the last several months

5
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,220
malware is actually kind of exploded
especially in the news maybe you were

6
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,720
paying attention to the news for our get
some of the some of the higher-profile

7
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,700
want to highlight here first the one
that just that came out very recently

8
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,299
because the NSO group selling iphone 0
days now I'll go ahead and give a cot

9
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,670
iphones security is closely time to OS
10 security will see why in just a

10
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,159
second edition that kind of wet your
appetite a little bit for ruts what's

11
00:01:52,159 --> 00:02:05,179
there so we have a penis that group 0
day for iphones we also have well also

12
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:11,480
have a key ranger and a few other like
well known here we go up taking malware

13
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,170
vulnerabilities basically this talk is
kind of what you need to know as far as

14
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,209
not just what's out there but also the
vulnerabilities that exists within

15
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,160
the list n itself now I'm not going to
release the 20 days right now but you're

16
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,130
seeking to secure a even from your home
all the way through a business there's

17
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,030
maximum network this is the information
that you're probably going to need to

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:45,400
know to go back to my slides though
security engineer by day research

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,850
security 9i particular work on
large-scale systems so it's not it's

20
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,560
entirely security-related although we we
have security stuff that flows through

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,110
the system the real design part in the
research partners is already beginning

22
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:13,750
because i recently got my few limbs that
happened kinda simultaneously I don't

23
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:25,120
want mother to change to the less than
downloading these mods for games and

24
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,810
both of those kind of making really
nervous and I started thinking about

25
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,890
like what

26
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,899
whoa i can recognize a malware
installation or malware infestation on

27
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,890
window system and I would know
relatively where to go look you know are

28
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,380
older and registering stuff like that
but when i go to look when it comes to a

29
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,970
mac system and that's pretty much with
this is boring

30
00:03:50,380 --> 00:04:00,370
lots of research went into all that so
one thing that kind of jumps out of us

31
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,090
well most of you probably use all i want
my $MONEY and the title talk was

32
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:14,170
exciting row and Peter dangerous because
max domi viruses right yeah i mean yet

33
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,570
we laugh and obviously going to disprove
that but the reason why that's important

34
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:28,870
is because um up until $MONTH 2012 cells
actually sold max own website one of the

35
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,100
features was

36
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:39,070
max don't get easy- still backing the
mac vs pc it and will bother advertising

37
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,610
now they changed it since 2012 to say
max are secured by design

38
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,740
they don't have the grandiose claims of
maximum viruses and the reason for that

39
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,360
is flashback came out in $MONTH 2012
controls and thousands systems soon as

40
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,940
they came out social engineering was
used as far as getting people to install

41
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,590
flash plugin this is still that max
didn't have flash plugin is

42
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:17,590
pre-installed and just so the one of the
major avenues for attack format right

43
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,929
now is ask that you not that people are
going to need that they're going to go

44
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,450
hunting for so flash plugins or job
stepping out now these things get

45
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:37,150
unfairly blamed lot of times I flashes
case they were insecure but anyway in

46
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,640
this case it was a social engineering to
get the flash plugin installed and it

47
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,289
generated revenue through well as so one
thing to take away our right Alice

48
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:57,910
rather immature and most of them just
add we're so this one generated revenues

49
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,180
were just displaying ads a key thing
that that dumb and two points to it one

50
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,320
it contained advanced features that
weren't used it was actually stubs and

51
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,409
home that researchers that and they
could have added a lot more features to

52
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,550
Adam community truly bad room kids back
doors all the stuff that was a modular

53
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,920
application but it didn't have those and
the second thing is weirdly

54
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,900
sophisticated just for ad where I'm
going to be the case throughout this

55
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,370
talk that

56
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,770
the iOS platform and while the phone and
the laptop the laptop is the staging

57
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,599
ground for what goes on

58
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,340
it's targeting the poem so and there's
several reasons for that

59
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:57,400
so anyway then we have a flashback part
to 2014 and this is um so in tako

60
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,719
company called intake Oh bought these
sinkholes that work from the first

61
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,330
flashback when they were looking for is
how many people remain unaffected as

62
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,620
time goes on

63
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,050
the good news is it was only about
twenty thousands of people that remain

64
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,990
totally lost access singles

65
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,830
the bad news is there's still 20
thousand so Matt doesn't good travels a

66
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,389
good job pushing people to update soon
as he comes out and they really you know

67
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,440
nice interface for that but they still
some of the same problem windows servers

68
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,590
which is not everybody days systems
fascination best they should in fact how

69
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:48,310
many of you have updated your iOS
devices to latest 935 no one especially

70
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,360
after I go through the what that means
as far as the updates but we'll get to

71
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,950
that in just a second so flashback part2
must researchers considered a nobody

72
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,380
view because it's covered in another day
and so you just update your device and

73
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:09,310
your final but um i would submit that is
still a big deal because this shows

74
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,520
activity and flashback part 2 was not
just residual flash they were actually

75
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,820
iterating on that design going forward
so this one in one of them so there's

76
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,930
lots of different flash flash back part
two is really just a catch-all for the

77
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,039
different barriers that came out after
the first one and the variance of some

78
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,799
of the variants were job so long

79
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,659
you saw a lot of Apple morning John lat

80
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:42,860
no java and java is there were some
vulnerabilities passel however some of

81
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,379
it was just they were taken off guard so
right around our apples taken off guard

82
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:54,470
because people are updating the software
and there's there's this vulnerable

83
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:02,569
space so one yet drive-by downloads
blaming job on that and then the last

84
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:08,540
event that I'll talk about the dream and
the setup this is key Ranger released in

85
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,029
February 2016 believe it was the first
os10 rain somewhere and it was delivered

86
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:24,259
through signed application so did not
say to so that was worth noting its

87
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:31,819
signed application so it was well the
fake versions of flash version of Java

88
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:37,040
not necessarily signed actually the
unpatched b vm that really was

89
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,009
yeah that was assigned out so key Ranger
first os10 ransomware delivered this

90
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:49,550
year i just saw a couple of days ago
there's another variant on key Ranger

91
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:58,670
that's just come out so all that to say
is that forgiven all that malware is on

92
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,769
the rise it down

93
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:08,930
it wasn't slow through the years ago a
200-year now we're seeing about 10 day

94
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,829
and it's nowhere near the volume windows
of a windows mountains you see but you

95
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:20,420
think the macs are completely in the
clear or not

96
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,819
now that said I'm going to kind of take
her that I don't want to to say that

97
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:32,120
maximum clearance still have all my iOS
devices and then OS tens but let's go

98
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,559
through the unique attack you are
securing a system and you just want to

99
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,420
make sure that URL your family's here
you're secure first you're gonna have to

100
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,170
know what is it about Apple that makes
it different fundamentally prolly

101
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,550
windows system and there's basically
four different areas that have come up

102
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,240
with

103
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,019
there's the boot up process the caramel
is the way that software install and

104
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:06,300
something called macho which is the
binary format that uses name is anybody

105
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,540
know the native format for windows of
the time you're in fact executable 32 so

106
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,969
and that's interesting because as we go
into blue process in the beginning every

107
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,029
so Apple security rises and falls on the
move process especially on the iOS

108
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:30,240
device so I'm going to sew an
abbreviated boot sequence with being in

109
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,670
power the device on and in ages past it
was the bios that was the first thing

110
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,139
that was giving him and now it is
something called the efi the extended

111
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:46,649
mom I forget what you have my stance but
even that's the equivalent of the bias

112
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:53,670
in most of the species that's what
handles running so ef5 was developed by

113
00:11:53,670 --> 00:12:02,010
Intel and oddly enough it runs packed
executable learning to either Susan so

114
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,569
all of your iOS devices actually run a
windows executable in order to reboot

115
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:17,730
the whole myself now it's just a p38
it's a small file however if you can

116
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,890
take control of that file and you can
take control everything but because of

117
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:28,140
that Apple is really really concerned
about making sure that their food of

118
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:35,370
sequins is as secure as possible for
instance your own well if I sits on a

119
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,949
fat32 partition you usually don't see it

120
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:44,550
um this is where your firmware
protections are so I'm on your iOS

121
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,040
device you've got a pass code before you
can get into your advice this boot

122
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,829
sequence is what throws up the password
spring first you log into that persist

123
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:56,370
the past

124
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:03,540
back through the term so the efi system
is really important to handles the disk

125
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,240
for the if you have a whole disk
encryption solve all so you can kind of

126
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,200
really stressing that this is the most
important part of though especially iOS

127
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,450
been process the boot process is also
one handles when your battery's dead

128
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:25,710
you plug your power cord him BF is one
handles living the pictures back for

129
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,270
that it's booting that is charging and
then it also runs another application

130
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,960
once it's gotten to a certain charge and
flips it over to actually putting your

131
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,510
entire system so if you're wondering why
it is as you type in your password but

132
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,410
you still haven't letting before you get
into your system that's because the

133
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,969
system has an action booty just went to
the EF is part you were put into

134
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,510
provincials and it still has to go
through the rest of the boot process we

135
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,970
haven't even touched the curly and after
the boot process after fi did we go down

136
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,100
to loading the colonel

137
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,760
that's where kernel extensions are
loaded and that's also where dynamic

138
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,920
libraries are loaded

139
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,500
these are those of you who are
programmers pretty much all softwares my

140
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:18,089
these dynamic libraries include things
like coconut framework is used on them

141
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:25,020
well it's used on both OS 10 and iOS but
in the boot process you can know

142
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,510
especially when iOS because of the
limited down networking all that they

143
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,950
will reload whole bunch of libraries
that's important because if you control

144
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:41,880
these libraries pretty old system one of
the preloaded libraries is the image

145
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:51,120
processing library that's actually what
934 date supposedly just so this is

146
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,279
where this becomes important when it
comes to taking control system now

147
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,700
before I go too far in the efi section
here a list

148
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,920
pi star and rebel efi so back Jones

149
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:16,980
the most was the idea is I halls install
android that actually have the idol is

150
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,600
going to look at other still pictures
are there so some people that down still

151
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:31,650
keep one around for sale by now but that
kicked off an entire row of that that's

152
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,040
where the jailbreaking the anti
jailbreaking everything else is out now

153
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,510
the pi-star vs rebel efi revelry and
finds a company that came pi star was a

154
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,890
company that started up and they wanted
to take this was around the same time

155
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:53,490
also with devices disease in phillips so
i started this bright idea we're just

156
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,630
going to call it is that boosts the
system is the ER fine already has to do

157
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:05,310
is get control to a two girl and was
Colonel takes over and does all of these

158
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:14,699
do so they decided to write a young a
bootloader efi just to get that horrible

159
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:25,980
harbor whole 80s days that alarm so
these guys entire company just for

160
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,610
selling a caution when all the way
through up to the Supreme Court and the

161
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,830
Supreme Court ruled that the bootloader
is copyrighted and this is why your iOS

162
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,490
device that's why they're able to resist
in jail breaking details now because of

163
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:48,360
this rule so as long as this ruling
stays in place they control the entire

164
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:56,820
stack of the iOS lies not always not
here on the laptop so that's where the

165
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,500
difference as far as boot loading begins
and yes this is important because if

166
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,589
Apple can guarantee everything from boot
through the colonel for the iOS device

167
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,579
then a lot of these other security
practices that they have in place

168
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:17,059
hello you can be sure that they're
giving you good in

169
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:23,658
fashion not possible get them and sing
it um the boot process also handles

170
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:30,289
launch d which we'll get into a second
launch d is the America everything that

171
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,460
auto starts on Mac starts to launch the
launch T is the Indian of the mornings

172
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,860
work so everything runs the subsurface
watch the launch day loads were called

173
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,908
keyless files that's either xml when
they could be compiled a list that

174
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:52,639
usually are filed but you're on your own
is 10 devices laptop they're usually

175
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,879
just plain text which means you can just
came to go and see what they're doing

176
00:17:55,879 --> 00:18:03,350
this is one handles regularly getting
jobs and also handles pretty much any

177
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:09,918
loading know Kate x kernel extensions
also drivers so any of that stuff goes

178
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:18,679
through launch T well usually specified
a meatless so another another aspect of

179
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,860
this in the mood is the firmware dma how
many have you heard the firmware DNA

180
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,039
came out several years ago

181
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:34,490
yeah so it's interesting how many of
these vulnerabilities exist and then

182
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,419
there's there quietly patched and anyway
max max security usually get some get

183
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,850
swept up in the lab so for whatever it's
worth so the firewire dma to make DNA

184
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:53,959
for direct memory axles so fire by our
standards as the firearm can just read

185
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,799
and write memory on whatever device is
connected to which is an obvious problem

186
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:05,179
so the this this is also what's could
also be going concern are considered a

187
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:11,899
later time but max solution that was
when the device boots up if it has a

188
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,168
password set then direct memory access
is denied

189
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:20,299
if the device if the device is already
booted up then you connect something

190
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,059
like a firewire to it that you do
whatever

191
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:29,240
want to now if the device is already
booted up in your realm they usually

192
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,850
have other controls and the way so it's
not as bad as anything but another

193
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:41,629
aspect of this is when you're charging
your device connected through the itunes

194
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:46,340
and you're sinking your device and all
that the route the boot process plays a

195
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,959
role there to move on and kinda want to
get through the colonel real quick its

196
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,309
kind of dense but I want to get to the
the package application stuff like that

197
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,379
but so the colonel is another attack
surface interesting note about this the

198
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:09,469
OS 10 colonel in some this is the logo
with the lowest in curls zmu but most

199
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,009
people don't

200
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:17,389
it's not distinctly map it's actually a
hybrid of armed well bsd which can be

201
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:22,610
considered like the new interface
deposits interface and then there's a

202
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:29,629
much a mock Colonel the mock turtle was
developed at nest if you remember your

203
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:34,399
Apple history child goes over the next
next is really awesome technology

204
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:43,549
including my they also know they also
had a precursor to use xcode and a bunch

205
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:49,879
of little stuff they split some I was a
Michael wedding ever heard of a

206
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:54,230
microkernel microwave so there's
basically two you have a model with the

207
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,460
colonel that handles all the device
access or micro girl that split into

208
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,840
multiple pieces

209
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,590
the problem with a microkernel yeah

210
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:09,289
the problem with a micro level is that
you have a bunch of pieces that are also

211
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:12,499
their memory and they're not tightly
integrated like they're not all in the

212
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:13,950
same address space

213
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,860
impossible minor ones when past messages
all these other places and so the whole

214
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,199
system doesn't fail in one piece sales
so if your device does something crazy

215
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,110
and it writes memory the wrong wedding
entire drug down however the problem

216
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:38,250
that you run into my girls is that being
really slow so apples been lobbying

217
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,159
hearing facing that problem it's really
good that the idea is academic sound

218
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,230
problem is in the real world we don't
really we're not willing to wait for

219
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,769
advices and just a problem that is more
secure so it's because of these

220
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:04,289
compromises that some securities laws
and have come on and there's really good

221
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,179
presentations on a lot of these
securities laws and I have links to him

222
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:15,360
towards the end so I run over this stuff
while i'm talking but overall there's

223
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,990
and outs later the last aspect is the
macho format it's similar to elf but the

224
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,460
biggest difference L being the the
binary format one is using native

225
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,669
natively but the biggest difference is
native code signs for this means that

226
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:39,779
dumb some other random trivial details
the magic bites border cafe babe which

227
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,309
is the same as the java class by which I
think kind of fueled view between that

228
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:49,918
apple and job of some great because it's
aggravating the binaries contain the

229
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,220
same magic the real immoral figure was
so the fact that they the fact that

230
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:08,039
macho supports cosine name one is a
fundamental piece of OS 10 security so I

231
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,399
mean you're trying to developing
applications

232
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:13,560
groans 10 or islands

233
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,940
anybody getting similar cultural change

234
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:26,490
I don't applications for Android and I
released for android to the playskool

235
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:35,700
battlezone so recently androids place or
hostile action free you release it all

236
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:44,070
three anything aapl.o last chance but I
dollars and I used to get really why

237
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,770
$100 the reason is because in order to
run anything on iOS device it has to be

238
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:56,340
signed by Apple themselves so they can
restrict their that's why can't decide

239
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,290
anything else I was less remember since
they controlled Boone they control

240
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,700
everything below it

241
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,590
they could do the same thing for almost
ten but most of us use our backs room

242
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,780
most of us install third-party
applications for mac although they're

243
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:21,389
moving in that direction for OS x
version of OS 10 mac OS is going to have

244
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:28,800
not only so in the mac OS now are always
doing now cosine is when wired or is

245
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:37,560
turned on by default him to explicitly
disable that no that's an analyst so so

246
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,460
much of format was designed to work with
that much

247
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,530
Colonel and inside of it has some pretty
solid engineering principles but dumb

248
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,780
course the performance problems plagued
it for a while one of the things that

249
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:58,050
they came up with two to bypass some
that performance problem was the concept

250
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,010
of ports and they're not networking
boards and it's not even really

251
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,210
important in the sense that your own
communicating well you're communicating

252
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,280
but it's not over wireless is in
internal communication

253
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,869
and the idea is that what am I macho
binary you can request a service you

254
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:24,119
performed by somebody so I masked design
and you said internal mass in the girl

255
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,850
says I have the ability to handle that

256
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:34,498
here is a hole into my memory space you
know go do some recent vulnerability

257
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:40,320
that was actually released at the black
hat issue last year was basically d

258
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,989
Dawson the colonel in this kernel and
have one of those folks and then of

259
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:52,169
course if you provide the running
program looking in your code program so

260
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:58,320
these are like native vulnerabilities
now i have not seen malware in a while

261
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,639
take control of that but like come on
you know that where it's what you don't

262
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:06,899
know that's gonna bite you

263
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:12,090
so other interesting things about macho
format is that it supports natively

264
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:19,649
universal binary format and up until two
virgins back os10 there were some traces

265
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:24,719
of powerpc code that was still bundled
in the bottoms just kind of weird

266
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,090
because I haven't sold those in a really
long time

267
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:33,090
another aspect of macho is the notion of
resource board best way to describe

268
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:39,988
resources like how many windows
environment plz provide certain

269
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:46,440
resources that always moving out and I
was the most awesome example similar

270
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:53,849
thing exists for 40 instead with the
exception that no s10 everything can

271
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:58,200
have resource force is actually a native
thing that supported by the filesystem

272
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,159
it's supported by the the OSL

273
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:14,639
pretty the software installation so when
I first transitioned over to Mac the

274
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,980
installation process was really a google
i found to be aggravated because I was

275
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,720
used to there's a full install program
it puts things on the disc and you know

276
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,100
where it needs to go and then usually
usually windows programs can uninstall /

277
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,490
and injection to put all that Kalyn
there's that nice add remove programs

278
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:44,399
well the difference in Mak is
applications are just minors or the most

279
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,030
common thing that you'll see in your
applications folder our application

280
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:54,780
bubbles is really just a folder . have
extension natively Mac loves working

281
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,910
with archives that's actually supported
transparently in the journal of a bunch

282
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:08,550
of different compression formats dmg is
one of the rate of it basically an iso

283
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:13,500
file that you can mount your Mountain
event from the system that's why these

284
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,400
towns show up and go to install stuff
and then you drag that over into the

285
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,690
applications all you're doing is
overriding whatever was there so some of

286
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:27,060
the problems with dmg is that there's
there's really no magic bites to

287
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,950
determine whether files

288
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,000
OMG for those of you doing network
security and you really want to find out

289
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,430
fast what type of files being that one
the bad news is for the dmg the only

290
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:50,700
spec is the last 512 bytes of the file
will have is cody KO something in the

291
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,950
last 512 bytes file so you would have to
go through the entire final just to get

292
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:02,460
into the variant and see if it's dmg now
the way I've gotten around as most dmg

293
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,750
impact as gzip files and so will get to
ya

294
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,540
most of my packages of file so dmg is
natively compressed because it would

295
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,590
impress also supports native encryption
fact when you go to update your iOS

296
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,330
device

297
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,460
what you're doing is you're downloading
and angie and in the system is basically

298
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:31,190
. into that dmg as the amount . the next
time the device boots up so when you see

299
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:37,460
the updating mac OS whatever it's coming
from a dmg file now the closest would

300
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:45,649
get to an installation program in the
Apple world is a PKG PKG our DM jeans

301
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:52,459
wrapped with aim basically scripts so
there's a bill of materials involved

302
00:29:52,460 --> 00:30:01,220
there give you an idea about the second
so its native pkgs are usually natively

303
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,639
compressed as our format that some by
spec it doesn't have to be as are so

304
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:14,059
those are as they must be able to use
tar and Jesus together largest combined

305
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:20,658
bolo collection travel and the last
common way to install applications

306
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:24,260
through app store which is doing the
same thing the others are except their

307
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,260
song and enforce code-signing down the
law

308
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:35,510
so now we have sufficiently pointed out
how may be wrong that I want to dial

309
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,230
this back because this doesn't need to
be a code Rick most of us within the

310
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,779
business that our iOS devices best
advice was generally secure and they are

311
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:51,320
and here's the things that Apple's tried
to do so the bootloader which enforces

312
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,720
apple's walled garden there is the young
firewall system that that is what

313
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,620
protects the whole disk encryption this
is what also if you have a password set

314
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,120
on your device and i encourage you to go
in boot device in the mains put at least

315
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,580
put a password on because that blocks a
whole lot of threats like the direct

316
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,029
through the direct memory and direct
memory access also works some other

317
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:26,269
physical access issues for your iOS
device in blocks plug-in you know that

318
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,999
evil plug attacks and why aren't we in
today

319
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:34,819
about the charging station out there a
possibility that being equal flugtag

320
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:40,489
having a password on your device would
actually mitigate that especially your

321
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:42,169
iOS device

322
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:48,979
um of course Apple was one of the first
ones to provide a SLR address space

323
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:53,719
layout randomization everywhere on all
every part of their system whereas with

324
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:58,429
others it was kind of slowly roll down
over time there's was almost a sea

325
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:59,869
change overnight

326
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:07,099
everything is AIS our gamekeeper which
macho binaries also have what are called

327
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:13,309
filing file attributes this is part of
the filesystem and sell each file and

328
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:17,299
have any number of attributes most of
them only have a handful of so-so

329
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:24,019
gatekeepers when you download on yet
when you download an application of

330
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:29,629
binary from the internet is tagged as
this game in event and then gatekeepers

331
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:35,629
what is what throws of the dialogue to
say you download the internet will show

332
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:39,259
you when i run it and you probably see
more you can just double-click on it

333
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:42,199
especially in safari have to go find it

334
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:47,119
right click on it and open it and it's a
behavioral thing but these are the types

335
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:52,639
of protections that are going on the
background another one that's there's a

336
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:58,938
file quarantine works along with gate
gate keeper x protect there's actually a

337
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:04,339
hash lookup service in OS 10 um where
are you

338
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:09,979
so a lot of these viruses the reason why
so there's the 600,000 and after that is

339
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:14,869
what spurred apple on to quickly put out
all of these pieces so a lot of the

340
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:20,238
virus show you towards the interior that
you should still an eye out for they

341
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:24,319
don't have the penetration is the first
one because Apple themselves can

342
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:32,089
remotely convicted hashes so X protect
and then what's coming up next is

343
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:37,069
Sandman sandboxing this is already baked
into the Cardinal they're still working

344
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:38,139
out some bugs

345
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:48,190
that basically containerization in the
Apple environment in applications that

346
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,750
are installed via the app store are
running sandboxes so it's not just that

347
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:01,810
is signed and that's another part of it
is another built-in protections

348
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:09,279
application signed it's really hard to
get somebody's cosine although that is

349
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,030
something that has has happened as well
so last part Application Firewall apple

350
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:23,020
has its own eating any code that is
installed that is not sign is subject to

351
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,500
the application firewall and if it
thinks that your application is doing

352
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,350
some battle for example if you're
running intelligent you're writing an

353
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,480
application you're trying to run it run
it on the privilege pours over 5,000

354
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:44,590
think or know below 665 yet then it
complains about that

355
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,810
however if it's signed a lot of those
restrictions of all the way and that's

356
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:57,730
why Mac malware now seeks the most
attractive target is assigned

357
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,490
applications with developers are
careless keys so with that I want to go

358
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:08,589
over the stone survey of mac malware and
this is the popular back mount where

359
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,140
this is the type of stuff that you'll
run into when you are i think my

360
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,500
daughter comes to these are the types of
things that I'm worried about actually

361
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,760
being our system

362
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,390
mackeeper is the number one arm because
the number one attack vector is

363
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,339
developers and don't have a tight
control over their security there cosine

364
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,520
practices companies that are kinda shady
in the first place that keeper they're

365
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,960
going to be the number-one target an
hour so they come out with a lot of

366
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,920
press release mackeeper is action
company but they come out press releases

367
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,720
thing that people just

368
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,069
you know in tarnishing the name and
release in malware under the name is not

369
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,119
then the reason why they're being picked
on us because they are careless with

370
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,480
keys cosine so because of that Matt
keeper is usually the source of adware a

371
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,330
lot of it's not necessarily delicious
most places that you see on the virus

372
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:13,359
total was classified as low potential in
one application and like I said most of

373
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,450
the stuff is kind of in a shading realm
opinion spy is another one that same

374
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,618
category

375
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:24,849
it's um well this one's really does
cross the line malware little stream

376
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,260
information back not necessarily
privileged information but it's getting

377
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,030
there and that's important because we
get to a later stage that is actually

378
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:43,359
full malware Eleanor came out about four
or five months ago and that was a true

379
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,960
backdoor capturing commanding control
its reach those pretty limited

380
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:59,020
maybe ten twenty thousand bread and
because because Apple has done a good

381
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:05,530
job so far of locking down these threads
my remember my fears from the beginning

382
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:10,270
that mac is the state around the u.s.
tens and staging ground for what goes on

383
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:16,089
the iOS the real difference between the
iOS and that there's there's very few

384
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:24,490
differences between eyeless and and the
OS 10 so moving along you've got wire

385
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:29,500
lurker for awhile wire lurker which
actually targeted both iOS and mac

386
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,869
installed which installs a malicious
applications and steals actually steals

387
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:43,960
personally identifiable information and
it also tried many of these viruses sink

388
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,040
out other things that are installed on
the system and this one was no different

389
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,480
it looked for

390
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,790
program called just going to the name is
a mac of fire firewall client looking at

391
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,470
that little soldier

392
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,000
yeah little switches that is the number
one target lot of these applications so

393
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,260
the plug those guys because it actually
if the malware is targeting into its a

394
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,869
good indication it's pretty good and
pretty capable of blocking allow this

395
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:27,260
bad stuff that defender is another one
fishing key Ranger like i mentioned

396
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:43,880
before is ransomware and then you've got
several others so like I said the bow

397
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:57,650
oh there's also Pegasus exploit which
also affected iOS and add win rap keen

398
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:03,470
app that was thinking about key now is
the next evolution of that came out of

399
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:10,669
august sorry for these slides together
um key now came out and it actually

400
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,950
dumps credentials from the four tries to
dump credentials from the keychain

401
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,960
there's actually proof of concepts for
attacking the keychains well scripts

402
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,950
that you can use and move into that just
a little bit but before I go I go on

403
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:34,549
there's actually a few other slides that
are a few other not slides but I

404
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,660
mentioned earlier the applications that
were poorly developed end up being the

405
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,680
attack pic so going forward what you
should really look for is so the sparkle

406
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,069
updater back in February a researcher
noticed that anything using the sparkle

407
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,880
updater which is a lot of open source
utilities you know people use the same

408
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,829
sort of transport mediums

409
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:02,119
other commonalities so VLC is a good
example let's say uses something called

410
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,619
Sparkle up so you can as in most things

411
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:12,829
security secur everything that you know
about but it's an application itself is

412
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:17,390
doing bad things then it makes it a lot
harder for Apple to come along and say

413
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:22,910
you know this is bad so several
applications we got into the habit of

414
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,200
updating themselves not waiting for the
user to go to the appstore anything else

415
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,689
so plc is one of those it'll say they
always want to go do that

416
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:39,499
what it do what it did was it wouldn't
download the EMT baggage and then shut

417
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:47,238
itself off transfer that the background
including backup so there was not in

418
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:54,019
active member that to evangelist and
like it was a lot of man-hours pretty

419
00:40:54,019 --> 00:41:00,558
mature based on Windows an hour so Mac
malware this isn't this is a

420
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:07,099
vulnerability and the sparkle update a
lot of other utilities use this is an

421
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:12,410
ottoman big feature if it was a
vulnerability because it used HTTP

422
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:17,029
installation ESO could be hijacked go to
any other place and download an update

423
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:23,660
their one that just came out recently
like just came out recently was drop box

424
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:30,890
Dropbox actually without letting you
know installs into the accessibility tab

425
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,959
a hook that they put it the reason why
that's bad because they effectively have

426
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:40,519
root privileges on the box and a lot of
their stuff when they when they're

427
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,339
installing it's not clear to the user

428
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:47,808
you're not just giving it the ability to
install you're also giving the ability

429
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:53,269
to control your system this is a
vulnerability not an active exploiting

430
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:57,319
but if it does become an export than
your strongbox with you

431
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:03,380
a source gallery now they did respond
today and i was just reading it 15 hours

432
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,079
ago i was just reading a little bit of
earlier but i'm pretty sure that

433
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:13,380
a good explanation why they need those
why they need that access my point is

434
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:20,009
applications themselves and the
developers for those applications are

435
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:27,329
are the targets today for mac malware
another source i mentioned the firewire

436
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:34,890
direct memory access of physical or
abilities also include USB so this is

437
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:42,569
another proof of concept issued recently
and the basic idea is a USB device that

438
00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:48,150
presents itself as so it presents itself
as a network device and because of the

439
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:55,200
way the kernel extensions are loaded it
done it the first thing Mac does it have

440
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,269
the launcher service and ask the device
you know do you have any gaming network

441
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:05,999
services so it'll run dat discovery on a
new what it sees as a network device and

442
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:10,410
so you can have a USB device that
presents itself as a network device and

443
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:16,680
then also runs a dhcp server and that
can bypass security considering security

444
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,649
controls backup to backup and Colonel so
it's interesting that this ends up being

445
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:39,420
a cross-platform attack both Mac and
Windows um so my thanks for attending

446
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,289
there's three things I wanted to point
out the handouts are available visit

447
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:46,559
dress i'm going to leave this up there
also tweeted out later

448
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm there was an enormous amount of
material for this talk and nothing else

449
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,900
only with the emotion that malware is a
rich the technology that maximum based

450
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:09,509
on is 30 years old is his old is
battle-tested but there's still a lot of

451
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:14,309
security research that has yet to be
done on that we're just scratching so

452
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:19,780
this year we had security researchers
turn their eyes you man

453
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:26,770
more so than other years and they found
three almost several several other

454
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,460
abilities in rapid succession and I
think that we're we're just starting the

455
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:37,720
Sea Eagles take max seriously isn't as a
turtle in fact to kind of bolster that

456
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:44,020
argument Apple couple months ago just
announced a bug bounty program which

457
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,610
later that adamantly opposed to before
now they will pay 200 thousand dollars

458
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:55,060
lifelines a vulnerability and the
caramel which again entire system

459
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,440
however security company came out right
after that said that they would pay five

460
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,960
miles over now that all sounds well and
good but if you go back and i encourage

461
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,070
you to read this

462
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,920
actually i'll leave the slider but i
encourage you to read in the endzone

463
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:17,200
license their stuff for 600,000 so mag
is the law of supply and demand Mac

464
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,049
vulnerabilities are highly valued now
because they're highly value the good

465
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,680
news for the average person is they're
probably not been targeting you

466
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,819
the highly valued malware you're
probably just gonna get AdWords step

467
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,370
however attention was running on your
back

468
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,850
utilities didn't have time to get these
utilities but to that i wanted to point

469
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,290
out well

470
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:49,720
no just pay attention to what goes on in
the distance very awesome and the hotel

471
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,100
anybody who's using a mac probably use
homebrew anyway so this whole bring

472
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,890
towel or a bunch of utilities or not
they're not necessarily security could

473
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,930
be using for instance one of them is a
launch d command that you can go through

474
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:10,390
and dumped out what's been running for
example this this is the launch T

475
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,390
command like an X and here's everything
that starts on my system at startup but

476
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,680
to give you an idea of the attack
surface that's on a Mac if i look at all

477
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,919
the system stuff that started up

478
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,780
then all the sudden like to start
scrolling for a while every one of these

479
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:36,850
could have something going on with it
just to give you an idea now not all of

480
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,220
them are that they're pretty well put
together anyway but you still probably

481
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,490
10 that's the good news is for windows
the windows vs mac malware environment

482
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:49,990
is willing

483
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:57,459
transparent match was won if it's not a
launch date doesn't run so with that

484
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:08,620
I'll open the floor up for questions and
let me switch back to slides one burning

485
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:26,920
. so they know everything that the
debugging utilities os10 xcode

486
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:40,480
everything's going to know ya ya feel
that got started

487
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:53,560
no TV is one of violence is not you know
girl stuff is like GV g so that you

488
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:09,160
don't interrupt they also showed their
own version Malik really so publisher is

489
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:22,839
30 albury no actually he's raised
questions you know what was the

490
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,150
there was a web-based or product that
solves a little app with that really

491
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:39,070
gives that after the grip of this bunch
but I heard your earth is the louse

492
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:57,610
having an era when you get you want i
was for iphone alright was over here is

493
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:26,920
Miles applications . Hillary and we
should set up some mitigation you go

494
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:49,900
into the aisles their evil maybe it's
just the last very much shaking

495
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,710
reporting yeah
