1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620
got it thanks only other 1i security on
Congress today there because we probably

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,540
get that so arm

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,928
alright good morning welcome to believe
in America track

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,079
obviously we planned this very well and
rolling

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,278
I think that's actually pretty awesome
that is standing room only in the stop

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,730
on we have now exceed seven hundred
chickens this morning so that just for a

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,449
second

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,079
little girl little old dusty Georgia at
7-eleven check in as a community goes

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,850
one thing off when you sing in the year
so I think that's pretty awesome so

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,059
thank you all for coming out and they
can be sides of us

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,289
awesome again or if you're in a row our
next speaker is um let me continue

12
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,270
communicating works it will be a mission
of National Defense referring to your

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,270
boarding on track of protection team's
record he's got a lot of good things to

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,799
say this morning i did forget one other
note of an Australia lunch actually

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,570
gonna start a little bit or 12 right so
right when when killing wraps up you'll

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,990
be able to go right out to lunch because
not onslaught if you guys don't know

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,839
what that is down the hall to the right

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,290
all of your nose ok so the next speaker
and from cpt give you feeling

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:38,130
I and welcome to find an evil in DNS
traffic little bit about myself i have

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,179
about 10 years of experience in both
cyber security and information systems

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,050
security couple recent projects online
and I worked out is a mercenary legs

22
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,250
which is a hundred tradition a lot of
optimized applications that will use a

23
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,750
lot of our custom tools that we've
written which is $TIME p.m. by Daniel

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,360
west and also the mercenary framework of
which again are created by myself and

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,009
inviting us a couple places you can find
me on real selectable seven on Twitter

26
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,070
get-ups level 7 30

27
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,390
alright so we'll go and we'll talk about
a little bit of motivation for me to do

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,089
this research on we'll talk about we'll
talk a brief dns overview they will talk

29
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,630
about some of the Maori families they
actually utilize dns for c2 and that

30
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,390
experience as well as as well some other
exploits with awesome i SES and a few

31
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:47,730
detection methods so why Dana's had them
white had that question as to me

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,179
probably 20 times because overall for
the most part is pretty born on that's

33
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,750
one of the reasons that makes it really
really horrible because it's one of

34
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,840
those things that you just it just sits
there and run seamlessly in the

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,630
background but it has an enormous impact
on all of our network communication for

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,160
a lot of different access to their
networks so that was pretty much of the

37
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,180
technical motivation but the mind visual
motivation was I was actually put on two

38
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,180
on an assignment so analyze DNS traffic
training up and they're actually using

39
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,730
dns for c2 and I've been detected so I
understand don't need to go back to the

40
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,239
books and more research and so sad to
bring here to share with

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,040
everybody so review obviously Eunice
user wants to access a resource on the

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,100
network first checks with his local
recursive server on from there on it the

43
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,660
local Reaper server doesn't have the
record he's he's looking for Ford's it

44
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,540
up to the authoritative server near to
the top of the main room and in the room

45
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,980
almost answer spouse return back to the
user and then able to power out too so

46
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,840
whatever estimate they really want to
gain access to for the purpose of this

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,790
brief whenever I mention infrastructure
i'm talking about everything from the

48
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:19,298
operating system to any other services
that are nested on the system itself on

49
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,789
to include the dns application as well
and when I mentioned protocol

50
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm talking just the dns protocol okay
so some operating systems we have both

51
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,409
windows and digs arm and all windows you
have windows dns or mix that we run by

52
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,110
there's some of the most common ways
they their attack buffer overflows race

53
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,880
conditions misconfigured Commission's
pretty much basically the the user or

54
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,590
the administrator configure stuff are
those are ways did the infrastructure 70

55
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,640
target other nested in a necessary
services on it as well

56
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,669
TP their nesting web on there as well

57
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,539
smv sips things of that nature the
protocol protocol introduces several

58
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,600
different vulnerabilities of DNS cache
poisoning dns roofing distributed

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,610
denial-of-service attacks that X field
command control and staging for further

60
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,810
exploits lot of directors utilize this
all the time to conduct all these

61
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,550
activities so start with DNS cache
poisoning pretty much self-explanatory

62
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:38,230
the cash on either the local system or
the other server will be modified by an

63
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,100
attacker

64
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,990
oh the unsuspecting user goes to access
resource system checks local dns cache

65
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:56,620
is their checks the recursive server
it's been poisoned and returns the IP

66
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,440
for the interest for the attackers
resource and the user unknowingly browse

67
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:12,730
to the fake website and check his email
recursive servers and local dns cache

68
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,470
those are the two primarily that the two
primary targets recursive service

69
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,950
actually are targeted for dns cache
poisoning attacks as much as they were

70
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:29,260
in the past on this is largely due to a
lot of security security features has

71
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,520
been built into a lot of applications
such as available room birthday paradox

72
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,729
of primarily you see dns cache poisoning
take place on the local system that's

73
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,830
either within the local cache on the
operating system so for on the web

74
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,820
browser some of my work families we have
mentioned oh I want to point out that

75
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,670
dns changer that's actually been around
since 2011's changer originally targeted

76
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:02,200
like local dns cache on the system and
now as a 2016 is actually more than two

77
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,770
targeting the default gateway and
modifying the dns records in the dns

78
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,219
configurations and a default gateway and
controlling all the traffic for the

79
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,420
network that way

80
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:20,800
oh so that was really important three
aspects that I want to point out for

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,390
tracking dns communication source IP
source port and transaction ID so by

82
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:35,349
default dns rose on TV which is
connectionless traffic not like tcp

83
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,240
where every possible through a handshake
and so each session is track by the

84
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,830
protocol itself dns doesn't have that so
it's sort of inheritance those

85
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,590
vulnerabilities from UTEP on and makes
it susceptible to more so it's a further

86
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,280
attacks

87
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,929
oh I want to highlight source IP because
with dns amplification an accident takes

88
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,250
advantage of this vulnerability bnsf
education that you have an attacker who

89
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:13,360
will send you have a tactical control in
the bottom it all these boss they will

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,630
sing at the attackers request they will
send a very small dns query to usually

91
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:26,469
an open dns sir requesting all the
resource records for a given domain and

92
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,669
then at this time you're spoofing their
source address so that all the results

93
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:38,348
are returned to a victim some of the
indicators a compromise on spoon source

94
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,780
addresses monitoring your network
trapping on to make sure that all of

95
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,939
them to make sure that the source
address spoofing isn't taking place that

96
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,180
should be already being done but if not
definitely want to implement that the

97
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,560
use of open dns servers you should be
using your internal recursive server

98
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,900
anyway so if there's any DNS traffic
it's trying to resolve using an open dns

99
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,180
server or any DNS server other than your
own that should be another indicator

100
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:19,060
compromise modify tl's if you look at
the image do we have to add to that or

101
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,390
you see a difference of 13 the tto that
could be the difference in like the US

102
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,260
vs Afghanistan so you definitely should
see a TCO vary that much so that will be

103
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,910
another indicator compromise and itself
the use of the any record

104
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,010
hello the use of any records it's not it
doesn't mean it is vulnerable by the

105
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,700
fall

106
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,080
however in conjunction with any of these
other being definitely it will be an

107
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,240
indicator compromise

108
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,740
oh especially the quantity if you have
any given number of nodes will say

109
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,920
thousand knows about your network call
making a hundred request for any

110
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,420
resource record for idea . or with a
spoon source address 0 obviously that's

111
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,719
an indicator of compromise volume
queries you have one

112
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,950
no it's making 10,000 requests or short
amount of time to a given domain that's

113
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,970
another indicator and lastly versus
responses make sure that you have not

114
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,920
necessarily exact an exact match for the
number varies vs responses but it should

115
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,439
be relatively close he shouldn't have a
thousand or ten thousand more queries

116
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,459
then you have responses for given domain
so that's another thing that you will

117
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:46,770
pay attention to whatever you're going
to traffic analysis and this doesn't

118
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,980
want to highlight three things on the
use of the inner ear destination and

119
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,800
lastly the size if you notice it's only
68 bites doesn't take a really powerful

120
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,029
machine to do that which makes this
perfect for like bottlenecks and

121
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,970
distributed denial-of-service because
you're able to get several systems of

122
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,260
scatter geographically across the globe
so I'll participate in distributing now

123
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:20,490
service to evict them without having any
performance hit on their own system of

124
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,209
their own network so if you're not
monitor for your regular you could

125
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,359
actually participating in it distributed
now serves attack against another

126
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,630
organization and not even know it

127
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,850
so definitely highlight that this is an
example of what that might look like

128
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,500
whatever you're looking at this traffic
from a net from the command line based

129
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,709
on traffic analysis to like t speak up
next

130
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,279
ng something like that and take it

131
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,430
play close attention to how small it is
this plays right into what i mentioned

132
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,939
before about how about how the arm how
small and resources takes actually

133
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,930
generate square

134
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:04,260
and then take a look at the response so
this response vary from that exact think

135
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,300
we're now just scale this and scaled
across let's say a hundred systems

136
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,829
within your network all doing this a
hundred times of peace doesn't match

137
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,760
your network and all because the side of
the query but remember they spook their

138
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,260
source address so all this traffic is
being redirected from the from the Open

139
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,050
DNS server that to the victim and you
can see how quick the result in denial

140
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,589
of service resource resource exhausting
so definitely want to pay attention to

141
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,160
those indicators of compromise try to
make sure they're not just because

142
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,360
you're not being you're not the victim
distribute and I'll service tech but

143
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:51,000
you're also not participating in one arm
against another fit in as beacons some

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,089
key information about vs beacons couple
of them very popular dns began co-op

145
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,500
strikes pretty sure watch Barry with
that remote access track for remote

146
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:10,020
access Trojan Vietnam allows you to do a
number of things via devious both stage

147
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:20,069
further attacks situ data X bill control
the number of callbacks that you get

148
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,190
like over over given amount of time
using throttle jitter another one is dns

149
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,800
Trojan which is no family of actual
power which use maliciously a lot

150
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,680
oh and it does some of the same things
similar to coalesce track something I

151
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,290
and i'll sees is important the attention
to whenever you suspect dns beacons is

152
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,120
incremental changes the attention two
subdomains attention to the numbers in

153
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,070
my little like random characters but
everybody knows there's nothing ready

154
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,080
so pay attention to those numbers they
have to be changing somewhere size of

155
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:05,150
the packets university CP in an attempt
to remain stealthy a lot of our families

156
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,500
they they live in the amount the amount
of data that shot back into those UDP

157
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,370
packets because once they go over a
certain size it will automatically

158
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,730
switch over to t sing and then asking to
be that's going to be an educator

159
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,210
compromise and it could potentially
hostile beyond the identified by

160
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:29,990
security even a network so they try to
maintain 114 bites of a UDP packet that

161
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,220
actually affects the number of packets
it because they have to keep back it's

162
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,110
so small it they have to generate a lot
of so now you're going to see even

163
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,630
though it's only one bag that they're
trying to data X peel but it generated

164
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:51,020
like 10,000 packings so i uz large
number of packets I'm just based on that

165
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,410
fact alone and for that reason is
primarily used the c2 but can be used as

166
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:03,530
that expose the last resort is important
to know that and then again . vs

167
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,569
responses a lot of because of some of
the security features that are built

168
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,160
into the application nowadays is the
requests are coming in too fast

169
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,410
a lot of times the server won't process
just becoming that so it'll have to

170
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,969
regenerate those pervs

171
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,420
so a lot of times you look over
networking you might see three queries

172
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,390
for everyone responds and that all that
also be a great way so or a great

173
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,860
indicator compromise

174
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:38,030
oh and require further for like look
from your security team is real life

175
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:44,839
there actually are legitimate uses for
dns beacons and txt records particular

176
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,960
txt records a face like sneak in

177
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,610
sender policy framework actually use
this to communicate exchange information

178
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,130
between different assets like you know
servers and dinner service about

179
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:06,689
themselves but one of the places you
should not see it is from a host you

180
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,880
shouldn't have holes on your network or
nose like everyday user systems that are

181
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,780
sending home dns txt records out so that
will be another indicator compromise in

182
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,110
itself some examples of legitimate
applications and also use DNS txt

183
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,890
records and a record our security
applications mcafee security onion you

184
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:38,699
Nate semantic they all use them a lot of
one of the ways they do it is a binary

185
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,470
suspicious bynars that they identified
your application identifies they'll take

186
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,650
it hash it depends that hash so the
domain and then send that out so that

187
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,079
they can all check that hashing is there
their database and see if they got any

188
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,000
additional hits or any other system or
any other network has reported a hash is

189
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,240
being suspicious

190
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,339
this is an example of militias obviously
you can see the side just based on the

191
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,099
sheer size i miss the gap

192
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,448
well which plays into like a little bit
of what i mentioned about my own

193
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,380
motivation for doing this analysis that
kind of goes it

194
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,770
Dean as well as things that you just
kind of set it and forget it

195
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,500
so if you're not paying close attention
even though there's jump silence you

196
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,650
because we're in the spring if you're
not even looking you're not going to

197
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,200
catch because it's not breaking anything
with the RFC it's not just the right

198
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,770
amount of the right size the right
amount of characters there's nothing is

199
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,680
breaking nerc so you can do this all day
if you don't check it and you're not

200
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,800
going to see if you're not going to find
it

201
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:54,600
another indicator compromise is resolved
like a while are you see here with this

202
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,360
domain

203
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,889
it's resolved 2000 a lot of times this
is this is used because there's another

204
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,250
there's a unlimited amount of domains
that you come back especially if you're

205
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,900
preparing data and your encrypted and
basically for it before you attach it or

206
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,530
pendant that your domain so we're really
having every every domain registered

207
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,780
into them in the in the dns server so
you have to sort of result to anything

208
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,918
you know here's an screenshot of one of
the applications dns hundred that we use

209
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,429
and as you see you have the same domain
resolving to multiple countries that

210
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,960
piece of multiple countries Peregrine
Canada Germany China that should jump

211
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,940
out at you definitely an indicator
compromise there and at least requires

212
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:54,760
an additional look this is another
screenshot same to just adding some more

213
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,900
command line syntax just to refine the
amount of output they were able to get

214
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:12,309
i'm using grab and now have some actual
videos of silly tues going to show up

215
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:19,870
ok so I a lot of videos anyway if you
want videos I'll give your videos are

216
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,189
going to be posted on YouTube to catch
those so i'll just leave it open for

217
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,280
questions at this time if anybody got
any questions they can ask or I'll stick

218
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,928
around and you can ask me on the side
