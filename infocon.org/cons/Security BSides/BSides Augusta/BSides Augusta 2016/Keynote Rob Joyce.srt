1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,500
testtesttesttest alright this one's not
hot anymore it's very probably just

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,210
often

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,330
yep check check check

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:51,660
alright I think we're good passes

5
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:05,670
yeah row and

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:23,360
why schools and in computer network
exploitation to deliver 4,000 so this

7
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:45,740
solution for i was very greatest part

8
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,149
alright thanks everybody I'm not going
to ask you for one more round of

9
00:01:53,149 --> 00:02:01,520
applause for all the volunteers here
today so these b-sides events are just

10
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,149
awesome

11
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,530
you know you think about the exposure
the understanding the education you're

12
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,989
getting for a almost free admission
right the nominal ticket price you go

13
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,350
away with the t-shirt all your swag is
is the stuff you bought

14
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,160
it's just phenomenal and b-sides across
the country cropping up NSA is proud to

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,889
sponsor here in Augusta we do DC and
Baltimore I know our folks participating

16
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,900
against her out night out in Texas as
well it's just a super opportunity to

17
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,109
make sure we understand how we're going
to secure cyberspace in in in the future

18
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:39,530
and I think the investment you'll see
young people here experienced

19
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,079
professionals people who are curious
it's just awesome so so as I get to talk

20
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:49,880
to you today what I want to do is take
you through a little journey and think

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,569
about where technology came from and
where it's going and hopefully as we

22
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:54,768
start the day

23
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,000
put that back in the back of your mind
so that when we're hearing all of these

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,410
presentations you got something to
anchor them too and you kind of rise up

25
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,840
out of that think in terms of a bigger
picture

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,010
so where's technology going what are the
risks

27
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,510
where's technology going that's a little
close to predictions predictions are

28
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,280
hard i think it was niels bohr who said
predictions are hard especially when

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,140
they're about the future right so I'm
really

30
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,559
I can try to predict too much about the
future but let you guys think about

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,560
where we've been where we're going and
then what that means

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,660
so I'm going to talk in terms of five
revolutions that I've seen come through

33
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,870
so this this is nineteen seventies
computer technology right

34
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,640
computers were owned by industry they're
owned by government they're owned by

35
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,859
educational institutions right they were
such a scarce commodity that they were

36
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,180
time shared you had to make an
appointment you had to submit a batch

37
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,660
job but you've got a piece of that
resource and it was a scarce resource

38
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,880
and most people didn't have access to it
so so so that's the lineage that's where

39
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:10,370
this is growing up from fast-forward to
the PC revolution 1977 things started

40
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,610
growing in the personal computer
revolution they really became home

41
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:19,880
computers in the eighties but this is
the point where the masses could have

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,960
this people could understand and start
to learn for themselves they could

43
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,419
tinker they could play they could
evaluate and understand and learn by

44
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,650
doing right you didn't have to go to a
formal course you didn't have to have

45
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,140
that special access to something that
was institutional but it really opened

46
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,150
the door for Masse's to get into this
next revolution right so first

47
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:51,049
revolution personal computer second
revolution at and I'm cheating i'm

48
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,140
getting a two-for here because i'm
really talking about the internet in the

49
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,330
world wide web which are intertwined
interlinked but different if you look at

50
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:07,430
the internet the connectivity the the
way this rolled out you now brought

51
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,930
information from across the globe and
brought it into the homes into the hands

52
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,970
of people so if you if you think about
the internet that the time frames on the

53
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,510
internet are very short so as we get
going sorry let me put up my speakers

54
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,190
notes

55
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,190
make sure i'm catching the right dates
here

56
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:57,860
so as you look at the revolutions in
terms of that the connectivity

57
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,500
exponential growth a thousand machines
connected in 1984 that was the

58
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,580
institutional . right that was
university to University government

59
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,289
research lab the government research lab
by 92 we had a million computers

60
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:19,430
connected that's really at a tipping
point where people started to get access

61
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:32,479
broadly to the internet by 2008 we hit a
billion machines sorry i'm not driving

62
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:48,740
the slides from here I'm going to pull
the connectivity and just run it myself

63
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,740
get started

64
00:06:54,249 --> 00:07:02,859
from the beginning it's like to be an
hour i want to be able to run over and

65
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,859
grab it

66
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,919
apologies for all the IT tech stuff
that's the beauty of going first we came

67
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:23,258
in and test it but I didn't test with
the record you going to reopen this

68
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,900
private

69
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
yeah

70
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:12,850
you need to use present for you yes not
trying to have it up so we're out of

71
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:36,070
sync with the outside piece last row
right throw me back up still senior

72
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,070
slide

73
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:56,599
alright we're good to go now I apologize
but so if you look at that astronomic

74
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,190
growth of the connected machines you're
also seeing huge growth in connected

75
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:14,389
users 95 we have 35 million users 2015 3
billion users today we've got 3.4

76
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,550
billion people on the internet there's
there's about 7.4 billion people on the

77
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,719
planet right

78
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,490
almost half the planet's on the internet
so there's that there's a research

79
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,190
professor metcalf talk about that cast
law says that the value of a

80
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,579
telecommunication network is
proportional to the square of the number

81
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,310
of users on that system right

82
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,599
this growth when you double the people
you don't veldt double the value of that

83
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,060
Network were squaring its exponential
growth as we add people to this network

84
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,779
think about the internet and the type of
things you do with it right

85
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,029
a lot of us have niche interests think
about ebay ebay started as a place

86
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,990
somebody wanted to sell their pez
dispensers right they started up ebay

87
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,209
and and it flourish they found pez
dispensers around the world people who

88
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:10,518
collected that small niche odd speak
thing and they connected them but then

89
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,810
other people found it and you know
everything from electronics to glassware

90
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,219
to other stuff but you could find people
around the globe who participated in

91
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,319
your small community the same thing grew
up in terms of information if you wanted

92
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:28,459
to know about something small and
specialized you can have somebody dive

93
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:34,010
so deep that they understand the nits
the tiny bits of that technology and it

94
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,850
was accessible to you through the
internet think about those of us who are

95
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,310
involved in programming right if you
have a question on a routine on that you

96
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,449
need a snippet of code you need to find
out why some things failing maybe your

97
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,139
your powerpoints not running right right
you can go out to that internet you can

98
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:56,300
you can hit the google it will bring
back somebody else who has dealt with

99
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,529
that issue before you

100
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:04,430
right the power of that information
coming to you on is exceptional third

101
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:12,589
revolution it's a cell phone if you
think about where the iphone right has

102
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:19,459
impacted the technology of this country
right uh it's just phenomenal that you

103
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,420
can be connected to all the power of
that internet all across the land

104
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,550
anywhere you go

105
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,550
day-night it brings it to you

106
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,990
the world in your pocket right so June
2007 that was the start of the iphone

107
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,850
right wasn't even 10 years ago and the
first instant instantiation of the

108
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,230
iphone wasn't that awesome but it
quickly grew to the power of the apps

109
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,809
leveraging the internet right and now
you've got the sum total of the world's

110
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:55,430
knowledge walking around with you in
your pocket connected all the time with

111
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:05,359
a-gps a video system with microphones
with the ability to interact with the

112
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,459
world coming through that small device
right that was a huge revolution built

113
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:19,878
on those previous pieces that now brings
more power to you remember i said took a

114
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,430
number of years to get to a billion
machines connected through the internet

115
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:33,559
2015 they're almost eight billion mobile
devices connected to that internet again

116
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:39,379
growth curve continues exponentially but
now that connection goes with you right

117
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:47,000
so the power of the multiplication of
all of those things on top of on top of

118
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,660
the information that they bring to you
radically changing lives

119
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:57,008
if you look at the global mobile traffic
it grew seventy-four percent again in

120
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:05,259
$MONTH 2015 who global mobile data
reached 3.7 exabytes a month in $MONTH

121
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:12,040
2015 so an exabyte is a million
terabytes the folks that do the research

122
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,670
have said that five exabytes would cover
and record every spoken word said since

123
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,139
the beginning of human history right if
you transcribe every spoken word

124
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,139
throughout the totality of human history

125
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,730
that's equivalent to the amount of data
that's now flowing over the mobile

126
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:37,420
networks today in 2016 in a month right
so so massive usage of this massive

127
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,649
massive volumes but it's the
connectivity the information it brings

128
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:48,490
and the enabling it does so I submit the
fourth revolution is cloud computing

129
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:56,350
right so it's the it's the big data back
ends that are now making that smartphone

130
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,429
or your home pc but that smart phone in
your pocket bring the power of analytics

131
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:11,559
data together in a fused way so that you
can ask questions of that data and it

132
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,339
will bring you answers that are
distributed are able to scale to the

133
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,779
level that we've got billions of people
who want to go out to that messaging app

134
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,149
or to go to that GPS crowdsource thing
that will tell you when the traffic's

135
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,170
bad and reroutes you around it
automatically before you encounter it

136
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,748
right all of the things that can be put
into stirred up and then ask questions

137
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:40,089
of come with the power of that cloud
computing and so really what that means

138
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:47,439
is anywhere anytime you can get access
to that data which is everything

139
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,998
everywhere right

140
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:53,740
I would submit to you that these
revolutions these technologies are

141
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,889
culturally changing our our our society
right seven years ago that iphone bit

142
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,840
flipped you walk outside during the
breaks and

143
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,600
look at the number of people who are
interacting to and through that device

144
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,040
may be down a little bit as people worry
about the devices and a crew like you

145
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,040
some people might not have a mountain on
but is you go to the airport the

146
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,260
shopping mall right look at the people
walk in like this or maybe flicking on

147
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,790
their pokemon go but they're interacting
through this you can check your bank

148
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,400
account right you can message your kids
you can know your home security status

149
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,689
you know there's there's things online
coming through this that direct your

150
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,000
life whether it be that gps app or
warning you that that the smoke alarms

151
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,340
gone off in your house right that
connectivity is massive up so I said you

152
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,340
know culturally changing when I grew up

153
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,740
UFOs were a big thing right there were
TV shows about their books about him

154
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,400
you'd read about them in mainstream
magazines there are ppl alleging the

155
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,620
government was hiding UFO information
from the public up there were grainy

156
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,280
photographs every once in awhile of a
thing somebody said was a UFO

157
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:16,000
now there's billions of video cameras on
everybody's pockets walking around

158
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,380
filming car accidents just you go to
youtube and you see once-in-a-lifetime

159
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,000
kind of things happening just bizarre
stuff that happened to have a camera in

160
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,810
front of it

161
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,760
where does UFOs go man culturally
changing right we're not seeing that

162
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:40,120
anyone so the fifth revolution i would
hold up is really the Internet of Things

163
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:48,850
concept 2009 people started talking
about Internet of Things it's really

164
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,360
taken off by 20

165
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,920
twenty cisco saying two-thirds of the
things connected to the mobile internet

166
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,060
will be some sort of device they want
have a person at the under other end of

167
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:11,780
it right it'll be device-based top it
was it's it's about fifteen eighteen

168
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:19,670
percent today what's driving the
Internet of Things anybody recognize

169
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,429
what this is raspberry pi so guy in
England said I want to teach more kids

170
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:33,380
to do computers he invested in sponsored
built a company that could could make

171
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,700
computing affordable to the masses kind
of that next level of its at an

172
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,809
institution it's a home computer but
they're still even a barrier to be able

173
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:46,520
to tinker and play and understand with
that technology so so the investment

174
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:54,379
they made brought Raspberry Pi $35
computer hugely powerful multiprocessor

175
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,840
it's got hardware inputs and outputs so
people can take her and learn how to

176
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,360
physically interface with the computer

177
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,260
it's got the connectivity to attached
device's whether it's displays mice

178
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:14,270
keyboards cameras other things but it is
it it was possible because of that chip

179
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,080
in the center which is a
system-on-a-chip which takes all of the

180
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,770
things that were discrete pieces of
computers and James amount of one piece

181
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,570
of silicon and when you can jam it onto
one thing you can drive and focus on the

182
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,559
manufacturing cost and drive that down
cheaper and cheaper and cheaper so so

183
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,990
much of the cost really isn't in the
computer itself of that computer it's in

184
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,460
all the connectivity that lets us
interact with it it's those big

185
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,429
connectors it's the interfaces that get
out to the real world up so the founder

186
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:51,980
of the Raspberry Pi organization was
talking to Eric Schmidt of google and he

187
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,460
said what are you doing next and they
talked about more powerful bigger badder

188
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,130
computers for the kids to learn on
things for experimenters to play with

189
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,780
and that google said I think you got it
wrong right I think you've got to get it

190
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,530
to the point where you can give them
away that's your intention is everybody

191
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,020
needs to have a computer learn about a
computer make it accessible get that on

192
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,840
the internet figure from half the world
to the whole world and they scratch

193
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,500
their heads and said well I can't give
it away and if anybody knows free it's

194
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,700
really google right they give away gmail
and the android operating system and all

195
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,120
of those things so is probably
thoughtful reasonable advice and this is

196
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,060
what came out of that effort right this
is a google pi 0 and I don't know if the

197
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,060
name is intended to mean zero cost but
it's five bucks

198
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,020
it's a it's a slightly reduced version
of that same computer you'll notice a

199
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:58,120
lot less connectors they drove down the
cost for the connectors it's got one cpu

200
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,919
slice in that processor instead of a
quad processor but it's still an

201
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,000
impressive machine it's a really
impressive machine runs full-blown linux

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,860
it will play minecraft it will run a
while it'll run a web server it will

203
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,310
through connectivity i use these things
i can go out and control thousands of

204
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:27,580
leds for Christmas light show off that
one cpu it is an amazingly powerful

205
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,919
computer and in fact that computer has
more compute cycles than that room i

206
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,140
showed you from the seventies it has way
more compute power than those first home

207
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,840
pcs i showed you which were useful
devices and it's five bucks and in fact

208
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,929
sir micro center in Atlanta

209
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:52,210
how about what's the closest one here
Atlanta so Mike week him for ninety-nine

210
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,180
cents right there that the cost of this
is still in that board in that connector

211
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,980
and what they've done is they push that
computer down onto that system-on-a-chip

212
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,010
but but it wasn't built for the pi 0 it
was built for the Internet of Things

213
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,450
stuff that's coming out

214
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:18,710
and the the pie folks said this is the
right chip for us to use at this point

215
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:27,950
in time so what it says to me is that
small computer is going to get into more

216
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,429
and more and more things connected to
the internet running substantial compute

217
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:40,610
power at the end node communicating and
being able to drive up all sorts of

218
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,418
innovation right seven years ago the
iphone didn't exist

219
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:51,110
I couldn't have imagined the things i'd
be using it for today right and so I

220
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:59,840
can't tell you all the things that you
know a 60 sent chip is gonna do for the

221
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,320
automation and sophistication of the
things that are going to be in our lives

222
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:10,428
so that kind of give you an example of
where that where that's going where

223
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,940
that's heading let me show you the power
of the distributed global cloud based

224
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,860
internet on a mobile phone

225
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,870
alright so if there's anybody in here
who already knows it you can't play so

226
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:29,570
there's a pie i run a quick contest so
i'll give away a pie and a power supply

227
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,059
and and and I an adapter and the other
pieces to make it run if anybody can

228
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:42,200
tell me what year NSA was founded right
but I said if you know you can't play so

229
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,809
who can figure it out

230
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:58,129
alright let's see the phone's going up
Google Google's are lighting up right

231
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,509
let's get

232
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:06,269
252 command out so President Truman
setup NSA 1952 with an executive order

233
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:22,559
there you go so here's a pie and the
stuff that will make it run and thank

234
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,489
you sir thank you so quick example right
he didn't know small tiny trivial piece

235
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:35,639
of knowledge if you had that question in
this room 10 years ago right

236
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,539
you'd have to go to the library

237
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:44,549
you'd have to make some calls you may
never know right it may not be worth it

238
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:50,849
for you to know but that's the power of
grabbing all of that information and

239
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,559
having it your fingertips right how many
times a day does that event repeat over

240
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,479
and over where you can leverage that
chain of technology to get to the things

241
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:09,209
you need in your in your life so
Internet of Things 2020 if you go out

242
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:13,529
and talk to the you know that the
prognosticators about technology they'll

243
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:18,059
give you a widely varying views of where
we're going to be but if you talk to

244
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,658
gartner if you read the cisco reports
and other things pretty reasonable

245
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,779
you'll get ranges 20 to 50 billion
devices connected to the network's 200

246
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,579
300 billion sensor enabled objects
things that you know know about the

247
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,829
physical world compute on them and then
and then do something with that

248
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:39,539
information right

249
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:44,369
huge huge leverage and this is going to
be that same exponential growth more

250
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:48,658
things connected mean more stuff that's
going to happen huh

251
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:55,889
I'll tell you much to the chagrin of my
wife right i am an early adopter I

252
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:59,819
expect many folks in here early adapters
as well right

253
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:08,940
so I i have an IOT device jury rigged up
to my my washing machine and dryer and

254
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,889
every time that that is done i get a
tweet right there not a tweet i get a

255
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:14,260
tattoo

256
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,300
text says laundry's done reminds me to
put it in the dryer dryer is done get it

257
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,270
out so it doesn't wrinkle life-changing
nope convenient absolutely right

258
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,870
pretty geeky yes I admit but but the
idea that you know i could put something

259
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:38,590
reasonably affordable and I could do
that with the technology I didn't write

260
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,780
a line of code to do that right i
grabbed piece parts that exists and then

261
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,030
messed with some interfaces and it was
there and you know soon it will continue

262
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,580
to grow and grow and things will be
connected and available and it and doing

263
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,510
these kind of things in the background
the same way that you know my kids will

264
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,830
never be lost in their entire lifetime
unless the battery died right there

265
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,550
they're going to have this always on
information there's going to be this

266
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,540
stuff in the background in your life
that you can't predict yet that's going

267
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:16,899
to keep us moving it was awesome hear
somebody trying to hey Siri right

268
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,790
calling it up

269
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,830
I said five revolutions i'm cheating you
might be getting in on the six here

270
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,280
voice enabled technology is is is a real
enabling piece of all of this

271
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:38,020
so that's a a an amazon . it's the
Amazon echo in a smaller form factor but

272
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,950
this is Amazon's device that you talk to
it's always listening

273
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,890
Alexa can you tell me when NSA was was
formed Alexa can you turn on the lights

274
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:54,070
right Alexis set temperature 262 and it
talks to these devices that are

275
00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:00,370
networked enabled and it manipulates
your physical environment around you if

276
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,229
you think back to those revolutions i
was talking about that machine room you

277
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,430
submitted punch cards to interact with
that computer maybe it was a

278
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:14,410
stored-program but it was something very
manual keyboards to enter

279
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:25,080
the data mice is the next level of input
touch pads on those phones but now

280
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,520
you're talking to him so as they're
small computer sprinkled around the

281
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,770
environment around you i mentioned those
connectors are a big part of the cost of

282
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,900
things if there's one thing in your
environment that can just listen to you

283
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,620
and then talk in terms of the ones and
zeros that have to get in and out of

284
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:51,449
those devices you've again reduce the
cost of that interaction enormously and

285
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,850
that one thing can communicate with all
the things and can keep that moving and

286
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,459
manipulating for you so huge leverage
and power in here so Cirie I'm coming

287
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:12,120
online a few years ago the Amazon echo
so Cirie 2011 amazon echo 2014 big

288
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,719
shifts and they're getting better and
better if any of you've used them and

289
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,000
it's just phenomenal the amount of
mobile queries that are coming to to

290
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,070
google across this interface that are no
longer typed right sometimes it's in the

291
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,689
car so your hands-free but I watch a lot
of people now who are just starting to

292
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,450
dictate their emails or dictate their
queries because you can do it faster and

293
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,110
almost is accurately through the voice
interface as you can with the keyboard

294
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,090
all the things right

295
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,530
it's going to be pervasive and around us
I couldn't even predict you know you

296
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,850
take away the technology you carried in
here the laptops that the phones the

297
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,719
things you've got your back pet
backpacks for a b-sides take away those

298
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,340
things and i would expect there are
hundreds of cpus in this room and

299
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,799
hundreds between all of the IT the video
teleconferencing the alarm systems you

300
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,379
know and all of this and as we go on and
on in the next couple years

301
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,380
you know I couldn't predict the way the
mobile phone smartphone would change

302
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,750
society in the last seven

303
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:32,890
what are these connected things going to
do in the next five to ten so since this

304
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:44,260
is a b-side conference this is where we
gotta go we start with small linux

305
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,950
computers that are sprinkled around your
environment right who's patch the IOT

306
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:58,210
device this week I haven't patched my
washing Missy but i haven't patched my

307
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,549
washing machine sensor this week

308
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:09,610
alright so so the question is as we get
pervasive computers in our lives and

309
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:18,010
they are expected to do things that we
trust right your alarm system that baby

310
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:26,110
monitor that that security camera that
internet-connected sensor for your for

311
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,399
your fire alarm

312
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:33,789
huh the question is what late bugs or
defects are in them or you know how will

313
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:39,520
the technology advanced right i spent
some money to get that dryer connected

314
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,100
if there's a better solution in two
years and this one's working am I going

315
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,370
to switch it out for a more secure dryer
sensor I'm not right so these things are

316
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,239
going to be baked into the fabric of our
lives and then in the process of

317
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,320
people pokin and proddin Adam we're
going to find these bugs and they're

318
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:09,200
going to be vulnerabilities in our space
in our lives so why do we care if you

319
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,320
think about it the cyber environment
today it's where our nation stores its

320
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,090
wealth and treasure how the treasure
being our intellectual property right

321
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,010
you read about the hacking losses that
companies have suffered where people

322
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,850
have stolen that intellectual property
and gone and recreated something that

323
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:33,980
they invested billions in to research
and develop and now somebody gets that

324
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,920
fruits of their labor for free and can
bring that online not having invested in

325
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,690
that and reap the rewards on the other
side and then there's just the wealth

326
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:50,240
you know our bank accounts are stock
markets and other things and so we've

327
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,750
got in sure that we're protecting that
in that space

328
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,129
Willie Sutton was famous bank robber
interviewed why do you rob banks Willie

329
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,410
why that's where the money is

330
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:05,300
that's where the money is right and so
now we've put our money out into that

331
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,470
cyber environment we we've also made it
so we can't live without it at times

332
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,559
right that huge just fascinating

333
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,410
I won't go down that road here but if
you want to be impressed

334
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,870
look at the business cycle that's
growing up around the cryptolocker trade

335
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,030
they have whole organizations with
research and development funds who are

336
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:36,290
looking at ways of grabbing viruses
permuting them look redeploying them

337
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,870
with the purpose of ransomware on your
push species and machines right the

338
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:48,199
Machine pops up and said you've been
hacked send bitcoins to this account and

339
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,170
will unlock your will unlock your things

340
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,670
well what happens when that's your car
and you know that little mobile data

341
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,570
center has to be unlocked for you to get
to work right you're going to pay that

342
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,639
ransom because you've got no other
choice to get in there so we're worse

343
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,000
storing our treasure

344
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,600
our wealth and maybe even relying on
these things

345
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:19,660
that's a very big deal so I made you
think a little bit about you know that

346
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,620
the sensors and the threats in the
environment there's a whole bunch of

347
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,790
ways that if you're running a big
business or your you're responsible for

348
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:35,889
securing something you've got to worry
about the threats in that space so i'll

349
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,250
tell you a little bit of a story to make
you think again about where those

350
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:46,480
threats come from personal story air
conditioner much like augusta up in

351
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,090
Maryland hot humid really nasty summers
rely on those air conditioners

352
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:59,110
tremendously so one morning woke up
seemed especially hot and steamy went

353
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,800
down

354
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,690
click the thermostat down it says the
thermostat thermostat says that the

355
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,580
furnace should the air conditioner
should be running crank it down fans

356
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:16,090
running no couleur great head to the
basement check out the air conditioner

357
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,050
unit in the house

358
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:23,620
everything seems function it's working
it's been in the fans but the the the

359
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,690
pipes inside that should be chill in the
air are cold heading outside go outside

360
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:35,770
check up the external unit is not
spinning so I i know enough to check is

361
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,759
it supply in the signal from the inside
yes is it supply in the signal and

362
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,649
getting there in the outside yep check
but it's not running is there AC there

363
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:50,080
yep alright you've reached the limit of
my technology called a repair guy repair

364
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,690
guy comes to the house he starts working
on the the air-conditioning unit after

365
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:02,530
about 15 minutes he says it's the it's
the power companies box that you've

366
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,790
affixed to the outside of your air
conditioner that cycles on heavy-duty

367
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,700
days has failed

368
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,950
I can't replace it you'll have to call
the power company so our power company

369
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,140
has this program where they put connect

370
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,900
did devices on the outside compressors
and on peak load days you get a break on

371
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,680
your power if you sign up for the
program and they can cycle them off

372
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,440
maybe 15 to 30 minutes during peak loads
and shed some of that power they do that

373
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,450
to manage the overall electrical draw at
peak times and kind of smooth it out you

374
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,379
get a benefit

375
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,470
hopefully you don't notice but they
drive down your electric costs if you

376
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,830
put those in I never put it in

377
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,770
I didn't sign up for it I didn't know
the freaking thing was there right so i

378
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,150
had bought the house

379
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,290
previous owner I guess had signed up for
the service I didn't want it i like

380
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,430
being cool and I want to trust my cool
to somebody else's decisions so I didn't

381
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,500
sign up but this thing was sitting on my
air conditioner and it failed and it

382
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,850
failed open

383
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:14,720
I didn't even know it was there so I
told the guy i don't care about getting

384
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,500
it fixed I want to go on pull it out
jump around it

385
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,880
get me my air conditioning and he did so
15 minutes later i was i was fixing up

386
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,710
but I tell you this story because my
question is do you know when you're

387
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,820
vulnerable

388
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,080
I didn't even know I was vulnerable i
didn't know that was part of my local

389
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,400
system and environment i didn't know i
had the vulnerability or the risk but it

390
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,800
was there and so when that failed it
took me down I had I had an

391
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,770
air-conditioning . and I wasn't happy

392
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:52,370
right but but it showed me that you know
I didn't know my my environment well

393
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,810
enough to defend it right

394
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,580
I didn't know to look at that thing you
know in hindsight if I knew it was there

395
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,890
and do what it did I would have known
enough to be a look around it and that

396
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,819
was within my means to to be back up and
running but I didn't even know it was

397
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:14,000
there so so why do I tell you that story
because I've really learned over time

398
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,190
one of the core fundamental things to
defending a network is really knowing

399
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,190
your network you can't defend what you
do not know

400
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:31,410
so I would ask you you know as you push
a red team at a network or as you have

401
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,379
foreign adversaries coming in as you
have criminals trying to do that

402
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,020
cryptolocker that ransomware on you
write the question is who knows more

403
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,830
who's going to put in the time to know
the pieces in the parts

404
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,690
who's going to know the devices and the
vulnerabilities who's going to know the

405
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,510
things that underlie that system

406
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,830
who's going to know about the one user
that really no kidding has kind of

407
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,060
jumping over your security thing for
convenience so they can get to the the

408
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,330
website they want to go that your that
your security system is not letting them

409
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,330
get to you know who's going to plug in
that thumb drive

410
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,940
who's going to know that that IOT thing
that was built in 2016 but is still in

411
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:28,080
the network in 2024 has a really
well-known opencv against it right so

412
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,090
who knows the most and i will tell you
the people that are looking to take

413
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,350
advantage of you and your things are
going to put in the time to find that

414
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:44,819
one thing to exploit it and so that's
the reality of what we're up against

415
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,410
when we have to consider how to defend
these things so as we connected all the

416
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:56,399
things as we use technology that's
unlikely to be moved out to be unlikely

417
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,280
to be patched on a regular basis and
unlikely at times to even be understood

418
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,350
that it's in the environment and
introducing a vulnerability i would say

419
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:14,069
you know we really need to focus in on
the technologies the policies and the

420
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,730
advancements all the way across the
spectrum right whether it's education

421
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,850
doing that advanced research to figure
out new and innovative ways that these

422
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,230
vulnerabilities are liabilities whether
it's the government that gets better

423
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,400
policies in place that are going to help
us secure at a national level

424
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,769
whether it be industry who thinks about
how a ten-year-old product that they

425
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:43,000
don't want to support anymore really can
still be a liability to the customers

426
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,140
that they sold them to and figure out a
way that we can continue to maintain and

427
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,828
understand and maybe automatically
update so i don't have to know when I

428
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:55,569
gotta upgrade my washer sensor right so
thinking about that and setting up that

429
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:00,819
ecosystem really is a challenge for the
technologists the folks in here the the

430
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:06,460
research community and the industry
partners right we can't rush out to be

431
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,480
the first to market with the great thing
everybody's gotta have knowing that

432
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,079
there's a that there's a fundamental
security designed from the ground up so

433
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:20,829
I'll wrap it up here again thanks for
the invite

434
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,900
just leave you again with one last
thought about vulnerabilities you know

435
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,089
the guy that won the the raspberry pi
took it from the NSA guy it really is

436
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:35,170
just a raspberry pi don't worry about
all good

437
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,170
thank you for your time and attention

438
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,720
trouble
