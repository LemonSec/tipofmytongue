1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
no wonder actually like st. Olaf has
been really awesome like almost another

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,610
actress now that was pretty awesome

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,698
we have your day and your order where we
have you know sitting on the floor so I

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,900
mean it's just been really today really
have to get off the market

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,650
I gotta be sure to give away first
person to raise your hand when you

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,740
sponsor this etf right

7
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:43,800
oh ok I'm gonna let me thinking it was
it 100 points are able to a little of

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,788
onions

9
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,629
alright alright often works hard

10
00:00:51,629 --> 00:01:05,670
ok so in this last year the track so i
have you John board thanks Bill that

11
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,240
actually are everybody will love the
size board is a security and solutions

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,860
and a lot of things in the community
just as a person here so thanks Phil so

13
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,930
my name is John Kerry for this is a
company is my co-presenter we're talking

14
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,369
today about hiding within so this
defensive trash off the most part of it

15
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,140
has seen ya comin

16
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,159
we're going to talk a little bit more
today balls enhance education experience

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,060
toolkit so this is a pretty solution of
microsoft has had several years now

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,079
people have in their environments show
fans going to be well actually this

19
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,699
whole for ok so how many people feel
that they are pretty comfortable with

20
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,119
musicians cool it will plan on it up
another thing how many people they

21
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,439
really know the soul

22
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,298
ok very advanced all people it's one of
those things it seems like that might

23
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,659
talk about where there's a lot of times
people are using it but there

24
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,399
understand fully how is always hot
control and manage it and how to push it

25
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:14,470
to their environments so started talking
about pretty much the overview of limits

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,650
what it can do for us we're going to go
into using independent security

27
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,849
historical issues we're going to talk a
little bit of some of the law's passage

28
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:27,579
and a myriad of things that Microsoft
has done trying to get going is retold

29
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,709
it's not something that is a great
discussion about is ones with you know

30
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:39,489
you know how to use writing is very good
solution provided in slc all securities

31
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,170
or center is going to grate on things
right now for as many people know we're

32
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,559
looking at you know some next-generation
windows stuff coming out of the

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,660
woodworks and diet coke whores a lot of
things going on right now windows making

34
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,690
it more interoperable x lion server for
coming out so a lot of people think of

35
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,160
what are we doing moving forward to
maintain this tool and then a Michaels

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,049
gonna get a notice the demo we're going
to break everything down show you some

37
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,040
things about a minute show you that it
works sure that it doesn't sometimes and

38
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,709
o-obviously how to use it more
effectively and then we'll go to the

39
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:22,000
discussion questions so okay that's
twenty dollars with the metroids no

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,660
that's not what is your nominee is on
the there's a lot more people think that

41
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,950
those tools where you just very quickly
qualified you're trying the best and

42
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,048
bruising and you want but absolutely for
coming here today to go back and have a

43
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,370
game plan for uses more effectively as
well as up if you have an environment

44
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,370
where you train others from them as well

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:55,180
alright so you really have two handles
of recently a mystery boots got people a

46
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,750
little bit about be so for coming heroes
in seattle he's been a lot of time

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,040
over guys all then the building
community ever get the chance actually

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,820
had also right NW washington stop by
some their meetings they have like

49
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,019
meetups and stuff

50
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,260
the couple hundred developers get
together with the stash a lot of things

51
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,349
the college's school I do a lot of
things with charities the most part and

52
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:25,820
uh yeah they got some pull behind and
right now i'm working on that g security

53
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:34,310
also correct information technology on
board or a capital so next is a little

54
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,180
bit about me

55
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,180
you can read the slides pretty
self-explanatory

56
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,380
if you have her semester stag is
basically a vulnerability networking go

57
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,520
into your game so the whole flows all
the different bonobos you think about

58
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,310
for my strings of mines

59
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:56,390
I mean you name it we also have a web
web app intestine and women RC challenge

60
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,510
so once you have it you have it go smash
that or check it out and that's me

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:11,960
alright so begin to define a little bit
more buying and planning in better

62
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
detail so what it is why you should care

63
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,320
alright so basically looking back and
experience will get one of the things

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,810
about this is a lot of you and with
minors all visual i really was brought

65
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,520
forward and honest though we could
actually handle all the applications out

66
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,580
there in the wild a lot of people
running older server editions they have

67
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,229
applications are proprietary third party
and you have to maintain and simplest

68
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,760
hey I'm going to my operating system
patch everything for today and we're

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,909
going there was a lot of issues that we
did not angry for example 64-bit

70
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,530
application architectures so microsoft
security service and hey what can we do

71
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:01,039
to try to bring some of the software
patching homelessness is as patty vs but

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,470
it was the mentality and say what can we
do still need systems to protect against

73
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,360
advanced memory exploits convertibility
is out there so they came up with them

74
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,530
and for that purpose and its free still
maintained as we stated mitigate your

75
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,650
abilities and software so it's awkward
fall protection

76
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,200
we're ready to the slide later on a
little bit even explaining more about

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,469
the actual security tools work and then
I cyberattacks corruption so a lot of

78
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,180
things working with rock tax returns and
programming all discuss step farther

79
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:46,490
apart so luck command line line line
tells you there's different things for

80
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,780
us is just a week for the most part
people many people have actually worked

81
00:06:50,780 --> 00:07:02,570
ok pull in right now is that we shared
some of these poses where you want to go

82
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,380
with it

83
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,570
rats and micro that is low and also
change your configuration is releasing

84
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,229
manage their the command line to it can
aid and detecting targeted attacks a lot

85
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:19,400
of people and cyber intelligence level
radio siren when you talk about how

86
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,810
great our controls you can actually
break down every school has control of

87
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,990
protection Foley have been and who are
these DLLs and all these processes so

88
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,180
when you use that effectively that can
help right so we're talking about a

89
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,990
maybe I want to see my browser
surprising hacks

90
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,760
right so you married and all and then
help you troubleshoot you get in step

91
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,380
forward and within that you can actually
control how certain applications utilize

92
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:57,250
its functions and then a heavy on every
protection but also SL thanks so you

93
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:09,070
have things that you might actually like
really mind and so this is opening

94
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:16,300
microsoft recently certified sighs how
many days there explicitly microsoft has

95
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,100
several it's not very warm though very
little warning pre-certified websites

96
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,420
you can work with getting one there is
really just something there are working

97
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,500
actively are now you know building into
that function so next like alright so

98
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:41,169
this is a breakdown of graduates . is
there really a whole but you know this

99
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,160
is actually break down all the nation's
efforts that Morris towards these are

100
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:52,810
all sizes and every one of these is able
to call on some of the work comment

101
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,760
you're gonna probably cultivated just
working with energy related programs so

102
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,630
breaking it down different programs lots
at its execution flow where things are

103
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,500
getting called in from our ties every
production functions to make sure that

104
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,190
we're not executing things from areas
memory that's you know not supposed to

105
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,520
be marked as rewrite this one really i
was going on that so what that looks

106
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,819
like that's all on Microsoft's official
documentation by the way

107
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,530
alright so using any with defenses so
we're going to actually get into talking

108
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,430
about this

109
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,329
so what cyber protection is to provide
32-bit legacy applications that were

110
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,120
older already that I asked my little wow
this is very common

111
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,420
so Michael works a lot with compound and

112
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:49,719
that is more than I think about this
here but not coder anything i wanted to

113
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,589
go already

114
00:09:50,589 --> 00:10:00,310
awesome family yeah decided a little oil
very visual people we work along ie8 all

115
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:10,060
setup really low budget allows i do you
know British automated process for years

116
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,779
gross

117
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,620
so a lot of people there a little while
developing applications they don't

118
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,910
really designers and compilation process
is not Valerie everything else does a

119
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,839
lot for is really thought this little
bit more private parking lot of your

120
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,120
applications and features that provides
the ends so a lot of the older compilers

121
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:35,350
are you know always at a certain angle
on moving into the Prophet time we have

122
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,260
64-bit so the latest evidence under the
spell of 10 years and you know instead

123
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,339
of applications that are being pushed
down a little bit even today we don't

124
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:51,699
have a special so Microsoft Excel
software does maybe it doesn't have to

125
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,990
be provided finest protections it will
absolutely work to protect their

126
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:04,779
applications will see your butt is an
assault can absolutely save review it

127
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,399
may actually cause complex functionally
so the cracks and trying to protect them

128
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,640
memory actually causing not to work so
be cognizant of that and then on done it

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,519
for these courses required . about that
next

130
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,829
alright so this is kind of a
continuation on new tricks all platforms

131
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,849
really thats it's not what your Pony
though just be understanding that and a

132
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,800
lot of business that's a really good
thing today to talk about its you how

133
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
many people work with man security or

134
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,000
services are you a better one to so many
times to get the best of our clients

135
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,670
like hey I got the same i no want yous
all right yeah all the time and so many

136
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,310
people generally just to say what
Michaels gonna show you the demo what

137
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,599
you can do to actually I'm not just nude
women to use more effectively and then

138
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,450
you can have your sock into all options
for every single or double deduction is

139
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:10,810
the medications but that was not the
roscoe programs videos all this land is

140
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,489
like a higher level you know your
science forever then you know he's going

141
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,450
to act not never usually start working
correctly understand and take time to

142
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,770
basically all of these controls we're
not saying that you're going to get the

143
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,870
wii's everywhere and how we're doing
everything and operate all you just need

144
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:38,740
to do have the functional use
productions for profit colleges i said

145
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,450
earlier or maybe sure it's perfectly
options might be called in from other

146
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,320
libraries that are relevant portion as
late as an example of something that

147
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,160
flows careful because what it does is
it's actually going to run through the

148
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,719
process execution

149
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,830
that's a couple of times so think about
is I this is going and then ok really

150
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:08,440
should be colleges that jump return i'm
almost at obviously commands move around

151
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,230
so many little lightheaded

152
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,050
that happens a lot with LLC people just
are . happens right so the right is

153
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,229
exploit the transport . things and
everything comes from also other

154
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,290
application you got like something like
Windows Update running in the background

155
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:29,110
is really cool guys little pieces of
code memories already loaded from some

156
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,040
other process a little function and
you're trying to attack process so they

157
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,130
try to reach out there and say I want to
get a look-in something that i use is

158
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,570
legitimate

159
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,870
you know I didn't memory for windows
right now i should think this is great

160
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,000
work so don't really were smitten the
left side

161
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,450
I mean you have talent on the right side
it's part so Chris teasing him and a lot

162
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,650
of people tend to forget that there are
sea losses with a horse best are rags

163
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:06,250
your memory way was programmed you may
use places one of the things that man's

164
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:17,470
issues powers and also the gravitation
crash and then the bargain results when

165
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,130
sorry I want it on the slide because
it's more operational control but of

166
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:28,480
course it is good you sell your belly
but do not question how is always best

167
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,870
Trollocs play around a little bit you
can take all right and then SL paying

168
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,190
don't really depend on it right now 31
and got a little more lust for users to

169
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:48,339
be a little more control and hard as it
is to travel is quickly little bit

170
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:55,150
basically the past and it's had a bunch
of problems okay to say no yeah is

171
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:01,120
doesn't sell back again 474 pads rises
use blue hat technologies as you

172
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
microsoft hey so we're throwing that out
there

173
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,000
whoever thinks that they can actually
explain memories being protected by an

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,660
application we want to know why it's
cool right there was really creative

175
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:23,189
ideas so best in children ready ready
yeah right LOL actually going to jet

176
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,020
itself little production is kind of a
lot of tasks work today so it attacks

177
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:37,560
the cells like our memory is ballin so
one people decided they really some

178
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,030
really cool stuff to kind of moment but
anyways well 64 is one of the big issues

179
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,350
that we have today when running it at a
horizon year versus permitted wanna see

180
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:53,790
anything that is how a lot of issues
doesn't have 64-bit projections yet it

181
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,410
was while 64 fully developed so just
note that that's that's important is a

182
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,760
lot of browsers today I think the last
year's service and values and browsers

183
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,150
were actually busy been hit on a 64-bit
hypervisor layer and it was like hey I'm

184
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,890
protections but not my normal work
because they're all headed your resume

185
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:20,819
or so be careful with that next part so
blasting through this little bit more on

186
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,040
several folks and groups of men have my
ways to defeated blue that we're not

187
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:34,530
really quick about bringing labs jared
montz x-axis cello reasonable model

188
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:41,400
because it said I want a contact eric
sequel credible control and arrive for

189
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:49,050
protection so everything was innovation
that you're like oh they can with some

190
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,319
pretty good ideas about using stuff
that's already there how we get around

191
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,070
bypasses veins we can avoid color check
around ya Yin and work tables

192
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,949
thanks for is not real big on memory
that works and show we're gonna use

193
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,459
what's already out there running and you
know the average man has environment and

194
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,690
memory and start playing around in slc
we get around by pass thanks

195
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,130
alright so Jerry out that can get some
return oriented programming code

196
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,839
actually riding wordy and basically
durable hey you know I can take the

197
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,679
stuff that's out there i can actually
write my own custom shows one thing

198
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,130
gland is it will almost as brazen as a
lot of American families returning job

199
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,560
functions as well as callings you all
guys from other processes that was

200
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:44,790
pretty protective so by default and can
stop those autonomously George figured

201
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,300
out the custom handwriting things
basically cool stuff that's out there to

202
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,370
get my text

203
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,689
that's basically saying the same thing
Jared assume the attacker has control

204
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:02,850
over trigger you're gonna be using our
work a nine nicely and use it as an eye

205
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,570
on it and I know that American
production so all that research hires

206
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,570
only right so the defense of people we
need to be understanding a little bit

207
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,200
about what the vulnerabilities bring you
know other radioactive for the software

208
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,630
. so Jerry exactly that and knowing that
as an offensive guy he can basically

209
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,530
pick it apart because there's one
information on environmental controls

210
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,530
and he broke his little tools basically
next

211
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,209
alright so our checks we talked about
this a little bit just making sure that

212
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,230
it's not you know using legitimate calls
its not using returns and jobs all over

213
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,240
memories hat coming follow place because
obviously organized proper code normally

214
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,840
doesn't do these things which men
explain things to you know oxygen ball

215
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,010
over its and then we'll talk about the
library just make sure that it's not

216
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,510
loading a dll from somewhere has already
sitting on the same way I'm here but I'm

217
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,100
not really normally used in the process
is dirt was able to find a way to pull

218
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,240
in solids normally do use maybe like
it's legitimate kind of walk through the

219
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,180
game six and then obviously this is a
little man has been found he put that in

220
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,049
there is because it

221
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,110
in second place for the blue got
challenge that's another gentleman

222
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,100
microsoft didn't actually put Jared's
research into their improvements they

223
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,100
put the other guys and everything back
in the next version found it

224
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:24,330
alright so talk about then send exact
activity f on memory protect this we

225
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,149
talked about that make sure that
certainly the calls are coming from

226
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:35,369
marks at pages i know it doesn't really
I'm is be right to realize that it's

227
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:39,090
looking for that kind of stuff basically
and then simply sexy clothes were

228
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,869
especially flowing in from a run a few
instructions ahead and let me go try

229
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:47,158
this out its theoretically the man i
call this push that is that memory

230
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,289
ok that's say was i'm ok i'm actually
going to return the job is just starting

231
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,999
to like an obsolete . and then BF is
obviously the export tables are

232
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:00,419
legitimate is ok for them

233
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,080
alright so in summary basically like I
said ginger was able to bypass all the

234
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,609
controls using legitimate tools that
were microsoft microsoft has been saying

235
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:17,039
something very important and it is not
designed to be all you know process

236
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:23,908
solution was designed you design make
happens have to work harder to develop

237
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:28,470
more proactive customer always bypassing
these controls and sneaking through the

238
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,789
gate and a nutshell it was an intern
which is really the tool so moving

239
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:35,220
forward thinking of him as an intern
strategy

240
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,809
thanks alright so they said try harder
this is all sections you don't know I

241
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:46,019
said that also it was like a one which
are harder to head home and next so

242
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,710
basically all set this really cool thing
where object was like hey you know what

243
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,600
that's right is injecting himself like a
mature we make those things distribution

244
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,719
maintain that mask worked so how does
that work was intelligent process known

245
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,970
as you are 16 time deal objects and cell
fractions all-around process somewhere

246
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,950
memory women's track and it's hard on
all sectors able to find this also value

247
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:18,210
is that is all go in there right 20 i'll
link it out and show the little flags on

248
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,280
set and disabled on this process so they
didn't protect him and soul and

249
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,540
protections blur protecting the process
a little time wasn't protecting itself

250
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,460
from these things as well so that's five
and then also belong to the moment

251
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,810
alright so anyways we get we have
millions on a lot of l by Britain was

252
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:46,620
being viable that just be home so grab
yourself protected said 21 someone in

253
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,449
its neighborhood process however love in
place marriage is also arrival also said

254
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,010
ok fine i'll set Europe and it was about
next

255
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,700
alright um and then they did a lot more
. and then nutshell basically you're by

256
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,390
yourself today

257
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:11,670
go ahead and make that code is bad
around we're going to learn to it that

258
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:18,690
wasn't going all is ok I'm just going to
go wire-to-wire noted water is already

259
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:28,320
included in Windows naturally and now we
know where you live now and I think they

260
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,629
tried harder using it you know another
Cody's easy goals and devices i resolved

261
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,370
late around

262
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,820
oh you can't find our voters will find
whatever they want to do that again the

263
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,280
cpuid also said okay fine

264
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,480
why don't we just go to file and use
this device itself a natural process

265
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,730
than it used in on itself it's all
physical and you know this is adamant

266
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,670
that i talked about earlier people
decided in school and colorful and hey

267
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,860
so what you doing with you and I was
recently also had a memory banks

268
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,700
alright so basically moving forward here
in 52 related to much to didn't help

269
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,090
that or whatever we put a little more
protections in place we try to hide it a

270
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,199
little bit more

271
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,450
it worked for a while but not forever
and 55 k mother

272
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,580
that anyways next part so Microsoft
internal change anything

273
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,299
hey talking box to this because it is
not meant to stop stuff and people kept

274
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,870
thinking as well as for but in a
nutshell they try to hide this partner

275
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,529
again and another researcher came
forward and said okay I'm gonna find a

276
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,340
hiding to reverse that and then i'm
actually using himself to disable

277
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,639
sellers natural function and alright so
now my kids going to give them a demo

278
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,908
business going to walk through logically
was going on

279
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,219
ok so basically you so i'm going to go
through i'm going to show you what the

280
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,419
UI looks like to show you a command line
looks like to show you when using

281
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,740
interpreter or medicine boy to do a
piece exact to the box to migrate to

282
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,269
process is not protected by Emmett and
i'm going to protect that process and

283
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:15,200
i'm going to migrate it again and show
you I'm it actually captures it and then

284
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,950
we'll talk about the local gpo how to
add local GPs to it and show you from

285
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,090
commandline how you can view some of the
protections because from the google you

286
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,199
can't see group policy protections you
want to concede rebelling positive

287
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:38,389
protection from the command line and
we'll go over there so switch that ya

288
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:47,000
never see that fine it's not cut off
organism and all right so this is a this

289
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,870
is the main goal when you download and
install and this is what comes up and

290
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,678
there's some default applications that
are protected so like office suite

291
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,659
internet explorer course basically
microsoft core products and they have

292
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:05,750
some profile files and call there is
called your recommended software and

293
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,840
popular software they added some more
things in there for you that we

294
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,529
protected the best way to update those
things are to add all the application

295
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,620
that you want to add to the software
just come up here and click on add apps

296
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,809
and bring above the screen adaptation to
go to your directory find where

297
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,850
applications you want to go to see drive
down to program files and let's say you

298
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,969
want to protect

299
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:34,110
you know google chrome go hair Chrome
application and click on chrome and plug

300
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,289
it in and by default it selects
everything except for a few things that

301
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:44,370
may cause you know may cause an
application crash if you look at it you

302
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,729
can see it up there with the ones in
bold those are the ones that are

303
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,919
protected by default anything that's not
a bold as things that you had to the

304
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:59,190
software that makes sense right on the
John remember all these protections so

305
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,309
you can uncheck any one of these you
want to step is one of the ones that you

306
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,149
cannot check as enforced by windows 7 by
default it's system wide you can't you

307
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,280
can't change that when you go to just
uncheck different ones if you don't want

308
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,610
to protect those so what this means that
you if you add an application that you

309
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,459
have an application is crashing believe
that Emmett because it didn't start

310
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,840
crashing to install it go through and
check each protection one by one until

311
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,220
you find one is called an issue and then
re-enable the other ones that we do not

312
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:34,799
save on everything ok if you want to
change your default profiles it's right

313
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,450
under here just click on a custom
security maximum recommended and these

314
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,720
files are in the am a directory so you
navigate to the directory program files

315
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,179
commit to go deployment you got your
group policy and you've got your

316
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,240
protection files these are your your
default file that come with it right

317
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,630
what you need to do a group policy files
to copy these files in your windows

318
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,950
profile definitions and then your mother
provide definitions you have your

319
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:13,140
English us and our show and second
that's your basic UI down the bottom you

320
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,340
have these green checkmarks that lets
you know what what processes are

321
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,760
protected by a minute so we see the
green check that means images protecting

322
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,760
that process and there's no check that
means I'm it's not protected rights

323
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,690
basically in this version of your task
list so what we talked about earlier was

324
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,820
anything that's been applied by policy
you cannot see from this gooey so when

325
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,780
you look

326
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,110
when you go to your apps right this is
this is basically what is protected by

327
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,800
any right now you will not find anything
protected by group policy in this list

328
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,760
so if you're a sysadmin or irresponsible
to figure in an enterprise environment

329
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,450
and you wonder why all the applications
that you spend 23 hours configured are

330
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,170
showing up on your client systems as
well you have to explore the command

331
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:06,510
line and do with their and from the
command line just jump there you talk a

332
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,420
minute on a score confidence to go from
the directory or you configure

333
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,930
environments you running from anywhere
and dash dash list

334
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,350
press ENTER to give me your entire list
along with your GP 0 configured programs

335
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:25,679
so i went ahead and already configured
he's ahead of time and that's why you

336
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,500
see those two there by the flop to do
nothing there

337
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,300
your local computer and you want to
modify your local GP 0 obviously gb

338
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,210
edited that MSC bureau your editor and
you come into application configuration

339
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,640
you can see it's already enabled because
i added those to come down to so

340
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,640
obviously it will be not configured when
you initially started up go to enabled

341
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,400
click on the show and you can just in
the value name section you put path so

342
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,890
you can put you know c colon programs
whatever you want to put on you use a

343
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,270
regular expression you can say star
backslash whatever it's easy just to use

344
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:08,580
on star back slicing and even process
because you might have a typo in the

345
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,990
path that you type in or that in the
application might be installed somewhere

346
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:18,240
and it's you know not standard the other
thing is that it's kind of a downfall to

347
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,490
it is it works off the passage give it a
binary name so if you protect notepad or

348
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,590
protect chrome and somebody change the
name of Rome it's not gonna be protected

349
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,780
data for some reason they don't use
hashes of of the banners that are

350
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,950
windows or applications that well-known
which i think is something pressure due

351
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,210
at least with the core windows system32
buyers right there should be at least

352
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,279
check by hash and not just by the
pathname of the name of minor

353
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,570
so anything goes wrong value is what
protections you want to enable or

354
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,200
disable so you can do dash basically you
can read everything on the left-hand

355
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,599
side so down here it gives you exactly
what you need to configure that alright

356
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,908
so we'll move on from there if you want
to verify the process is being protected

357
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:09,320
by use process hacker some of you
probably use sysinternals our process

358
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,789
explored can do the same thing I just
before process hacker cool thing about

359
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:18,379
process occurs if you have somebody
create service on your box or does nice

360
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:21,649
things for a second give you an alert
service got created service got deleted

361
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:25,820
so that's kind of why I like using it
and just one thing that does that a

362
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,070
process explorer doesn't do so will
check and see what processes we have

363
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,428
protected right we said we can come to
the main screen and look at here we can

364
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:38,809
do from the console and so we see we
have a command commander Dax is

365
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:39,799
protected right

366
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:47,899
we also sort of command line is it
anyway it's not in here so let's add one

367
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:52,039
in the third on top okay so it's
protected right so it's got all the

368
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:57,259
default protections so let's see where
that dll is this on commander Dax here

369
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:04,969
is go to properties and process process
attacker private showing modules in the

370
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:07,969
student notepad be a lot easier

371
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:11,149
nope there's no compact plus plus

372
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:27,320
alright so note that this bus where's
that means running there is an app that

373
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,999
would be amazing

374
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:35,210
alright so if you do have a process
running Google properties or modules and

375
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,479
you can see around $TIME a.m. dilo
rights any process that you add to

376
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,889
Emmett and you want to verify this
actually protecting that process you can

377
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:47,209
come in here and check it out that when
there's also another tool and historical

378
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,200
this dll so this module think things
called a show you all the deals over

379
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,070
there if you happen to run in and you
don't see that deal owners probably cuz

380
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,250
that process is already right

381
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,510
you have to restart the process that way
you can can add that protection so if

382
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,680
you add add the binary 2m it while it's
still running it will protect it

383
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,750
you have to restart that process ok I
society various mine it's a 64 bit

384
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,790
processor same thing you'll see in a 64
an idea though my only an image . of

385
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,230
current version ended

386
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:22,080
alright so i'm going to show you a
process that's not protected

387
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:30,300
I'm gonna go to model the screen and i'm
going to use a i'm already connected and

388
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,000
see have to recreate session some
statistics said nothing fancy so

389
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,290
standard 2 i'm just using that is . to
do it and if you PS exacta box and it

390
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,409
will not detect that right doesn't
detect sequel injection it doesn't set

391
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:51,630
the tech you clicking on a binary gets
mighty Rochelle it detects things that

392
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,910
happen in memory to a process right so
wrong

393
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:08,370
see already there so let's find a
process that's not being protected see

394
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,939
or we can create

395
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:45,110
so and killing yeah alright so we'll run
ms paint again will double check that

396
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,659
it's not being protected by a minute and
by the way if I want to do that from the

397
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,820
command line i'll just do a minute I'll
do delete and then the path to ms payne

398
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:02,030
right or I'll do just you know Walker
backslash just mspaint start this pain

399
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,790
same thing you can do everything delete
all another thing know if you do you do

400
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,149
an app from from are you can't delete an
app from the command line that's a group

401
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:17,359
policy enabled application so discordant
a-plus-plus was at a good group policy

402
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,060
you can't from the command line to say
that you have to use good policy to that

403
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,649
there might be a consideration for using
group policy versus just using the doing

404
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:31,489
so anyway already removed that got
patron we're going to check the news

405
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:37,638
prosperity that's actually disabled
mspaint here properties go to modules

406
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:45,050
skeptical so we got ms64 under so it's
still still protecting that drive them

407
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:52,190
in this paints paints we should actually
do that off

408
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,550
ok fresh

409
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:26,530
watch that

410
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:47,230
alright so let's see if it was paint so
we got 6012 depend on my grades and so

411
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,280
if it's any buyers protected or process
to protect behind a little pop-up little

412
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,410
notification saying year protection and
detective or wear protection that

413
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:01,120
stopped mitigated it'll basically
turning process so we can see we

414
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,270
migrated successfully that process 6012
nothing happened right we can still

415
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:12,790
still move around still do stuff i can
drop the shell funny to you know it's

416
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,190
not trigger anything right now this user
has no clue that somebody's on a box

417
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,270
alright so now we're gonna protect I'm
going to turn the protection a lot of

418
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,360
pain is still running and show you that
it doesn't it still doesn't protect it

419
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,650
or detect that somebody's in that that
process so we'll go from the command

420
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,890
line just to show you that you can go
from the command line for those of you

421
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:42,520
that like the command line command set
not add and then you can just do you

422
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:54,100
star backslash mspaint having this pain
already in there yeah it's already in

423
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,100
space on

424
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:11,560
alright let's do a bit more ads in their
right mind

425
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:26,400
alright so when you adaptation to admit
it will give you this little statement

426
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,650
is an achievement you may need to
restart which is what I talked about

427
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,989
earlier if you don't restart it

428
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:40,469
it's not protected right so we have no
cat running will close it run it again

429
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:48,180
didn't want that I've got my setup so
whenever no padding around the bad plus

430
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,129
plus

431
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,809
alright so we got that running now when
we come back over here we'll see what

432
00:37:54,809 --> 00:38:13,410
did that is for notepad and we've got
3716 no let's get out the show first and

433
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,410
my help

434
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:26,489
alright so once my grand you see images
detected BF detected motion detected and

435
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:29,729
mitigation will close the application
notepad.exe that's what happens when you

436
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:34,529
migrate when using material to migrate
to another process is protected by in it

437
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:41,969
you get that dedication determination
process the person interpreter show will

438
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:47,579
crash so it's still trying to migrate
but eventually crash my session will die

439
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:54,119
and life goes on right on this end
several things happen if you go to your

440
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,249
event longer right you'll see my login
so if you're doing remote login to get

441
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:04,529
capturing the black the logs and
anything that triggers on will say in it

442
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:07,799
so you can filter log of everything that
says in it and I'll tell you exactly

443
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:12,449
which process trigger so if you look
down here you guys in system32 ms paint

444
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:19,349
before that I to tell you that it was
enabled so this is when I added it will

445
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:22,559
give you all you default protections
everything that's enabled so it's pretty

446
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,939
detailed information for you know
anything that you need new protections

447
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:38,430
any questions so far alright so like I
said he had a group policy your local

448
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,210
policy

449
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,660
these are all configurations you only
get these settings once you copy those

450
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,730
files showed you in to show you the
directory so you take these files that's

451
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:52,230
in your deployment folder so you go to
deployment group policy you copy each

452
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:58,560
one of these when you go down to your
windows directory round windows and any

453
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,890
little profile definitions so the admx
files in here and in the other file goes

454
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,879
into this directory and then you open up
your local group policy editor these

455
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,260
these comparisons of available at the
under windows client and/or you can do a

456
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,260
search and look at everything as a
minute

457
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:31,980
alright that's pretty much it so that
goes into our recommendations as long as

458
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:40,920
there's a little bit of acid cycle power
on being active dude is that had

459
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,050
intended goals is slowly losing
something solid lines so as you notice

460
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,280
before when able to see anything
everything is moving around the library

461
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,950
just like that though using it correctly
fully-managed right we will see that

462
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:04,350
renders table litigation in there was a
lot that is drawn into that process and

463
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,020
protected that isn't one more thing then

464
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,610
so this is the xml file for the
recommended software that it comes about

465
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,090
fault so you have your office suite
that's pretty much what it looks like

466
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,300
and then if you want to create your own
custom file so let's say you have an

467
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,190
enterprise that you don't use Google+
some reason you just want to create a

468
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,940
custom profile this is what it looks
like you wouldn't do this by hand so

469
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,590
you're not going to just hack away at no
pay you go to application you add every

470
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:36,390
application you want on a test box and
then you export that so if you go to MIT

471
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,379
just do there's a feature to export the
current configuration and then you take

472
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,570
that file and maybe set up a share and
have

473
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,630
everybody every other box pulled from
that share or however you want to

474
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,500
distribute that XML hot that's also an
option group policy you can manually

475
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,120
configure everything that application
you can create a profile box and export

476
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,120
that and utilize that question

477
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:07,320
it's not any more protected than
anything else in the program followed

478
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:22,770
the virtual so it reads the
configuration file once it runs and it

479
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,750
doesn't keep rereading that follows you

480
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,760
you know all three starters election
nice

481
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:38,549
yes the planning on bringing the authors
and methodology was the answer the back

482
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:45,720
that static file box problem but if you
push it out the group policy then you

483
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,669
have to just like anything else

484
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:54,720
whenever anyone's and even as because
the use that's on that system it doesn't

485
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,149
run as system or any other user one says
that's that's probably a lot of these

486
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,380
applications if they run the same user
space malware runs in the same user

487
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,700
space there baby

488
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,069
both competed and obviously running as
an internal space is not a good idea

489
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,610
right so that's the problem we have
right now which is going to leave some

490
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:32,820
of the recommendations that we have
later when professional dancer most yeah

491
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,890
your question was already together

492
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:58,240
ice creams and lotions microsoft
products you know what it is like which

493
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,859
was anybody running

494
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,260
yeah so they they do admit there's
problems and conflicts and that's why

495
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,760
some things are off by default but if
carbon should fix a lot of those

496
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,480
problems

497
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,930
I don't know you're running to know the
current version i mean like what version

498
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:22,120
you're running because they just updated
passionate spot 151 now i don't remember

499
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,250
the exact date but I know there was five

500
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:29,620
there's like a recent one of 5.51 so try
that one see the other problems or just

501
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,220
disable uaf so it's not a it's not the
end all be all

502
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,279
there's just different layers that the
attack has to go through and have an

503
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,850
image is it's just going to be way
better than not having anything else and

504
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:48,100
I said to be able to give you that
problem just disable the same way that's

505
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,930
the microsoft recommended way of oh if
you have an application this compressive

506
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,460
conflict within one by one disabled them
and see which one cause of the problem

507
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:11,080
and just keep that one off will keep
everything Hillsong just basically we're

508
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,230
going to talk about goals were
researched out looking but it's

509
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:21,190
basically valley and my body said
earlier half day's proceeds so no nose

510
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:27,550
and based on just the roses bathroom
natural after buying right initially or

511
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,210
dance things passing it and then I
extensive list of politics but

512
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:36,930
application really cool and she has
immunity is well crowdsourcing

513
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:44,069
and then I control though as you travel
technology shadows back it'll be looking

514
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:46,770
into this is awesome

515
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:51,059
you're liable to get out there and get
dirty talk about do tell extensions are

516
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:55,710
going to use a supporting an earlier
that and remember how sit in the bus bar

517
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,790
potential base is productive remember
anybody heard of shadow set

518
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,460
yeah it's nothing

519
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:13,020
get ya up so we're going to wrap it up
any questions at this michael i will be

520
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,329
available as well and he catches my mind
so hopefully we did also injected a just

521
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:22,559
basically all understand it and it's not
perfect and I'll be all this time

522
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,040
it definitely has a lot of work that's
going on right now as we said there's

523
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:33,300
about what constituted that so fun and
we use it properly more effectively or

524
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:39,420
plain sight see it was like I will go to
questions are going to be the least we

525
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:45,780
have our girls sponsors roads out of
students office the event wasn't running

ok I could

532
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:26,569
you see what's the name of the command
line tool used to configure in it

533
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,039
you're the answer

534
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:46,339
uh let's see what's name of protection
