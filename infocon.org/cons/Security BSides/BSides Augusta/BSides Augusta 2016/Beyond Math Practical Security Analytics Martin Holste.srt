1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,119
I'm very always very us says everything
to sorcery building here patient's

2
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,590
Sergey outstrips easy

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:37,440
you are so we'll see

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,780
thanks dad check email

5
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,010
hey I know a little bit about a few
things

6
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm usually better look at how do you
guys saw Patrick bago that was an

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,140
awesome talk we coordinated all we
should yes

8
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,540
ya think it would have been a great
collaborative double top but it is

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:17,520
really good like evidence to back up you
know what it was really cool to see that

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,830
you know mad that I had a hunch about
and started with an out and that's kind

11
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,429
of important because when i started

12
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:42,320
hey I wasn't I thought I was kind of
waiting for someone else and if anything

13
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,800
they're gonna talk to you know you have
a question

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:02:09,350
I'll was your only great so i started it
the more guys more so that was kind of a

15
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:19,489
big lesson for me find something
anything is probably right so how do you

16
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:28,340
guys run analytics your several good how
many would say that you very mature

17
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:36,350
okay well then so I'm giving this talk a
couple of times and each time it's about

18
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,760
the response been giving talks for years
and for the most part . only like better

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,730
response of pocket because it seems to
resonate a little bit more each time it

20
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,660
i find out what it is that makes me feel
good that police we can kind of talk

21
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,690
about some of these things to get them
out there because i think in our

22
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,250
industry there's just so much to no one
understand that having you know and

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,110
structured conversation about some of
these tough areas is really important so

24
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,660
is nothing else i hope that switch out
of it so you know so much more about me

25
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:18,140
Doug already went through that there's
my github and into her handle and I

26
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:28,220
before I so while back and privilege
talking to attach Ibaka and that sort of

27
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,230
with more depth on the statement this is
right off the web and he had for many

28
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,459
years and it's like this but he's been
looking at analytics for Gardner for a

29
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,380
while and this was recorded was stuck
out

30
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,070
so is it just here is that you already
have enough tools job that you're angry

31
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,209
you're already trying to figure out all
the tools you have and then you throw

32
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,980
another 21 pics and probably going to
get some diminishing returns and one of

33
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,970
the tools and literature notice all the
side . but certainly Great Lakes because

34
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,100
not only is another tool too complicated
so his wine is that we can expect a

35
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,970
security incident response team or stock
to be have something thrust upon them

36
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,120
and then it will just magically make
everything better and we really have to

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,180
watch out for that so I did you think
about snake oil

38
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,869
it's not whether or not oil pumps six
makeup like up snakes but whether or not

39
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,620
it provides any values the question and
I think that that is fundamental

40
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,910
question about analytics so it's not a
question about whether the math is right

41
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,650
or wrong it's not a question about you
know is this algorithm executing

42
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,940
correctly the question is whether or not
that's gonna help you find the bag and

43
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,310
that's what we want to look at because
might make pieces here and it up for

44
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,540
debate on it but what I found so far is
that it's very difficult for them to

45
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:03,240
provide value on their own so why is it
that help you have a number of

46
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,510
challenges and easiest way to explain it
is that it comes from other industries

47
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,060
and we successfully using analytics so
here we're going on say hands on your

48
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,300
target online retailers and you are
looking at changes are you can see at

49
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,480
the bottom you might also want right now
what is the cost for them being wrong

50
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,660
about that and learning not a lot right
so either you don't look at it that

51
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,900
their whole scenario but big deal or you
can click on it you like it's not really

52
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,049
for me so the risk of false positives
false negative in that scenario is you

53
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,590
know almost non-existent no one cares
it's just a shot in the dark works worse

54
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,330
and you only be testing

55
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,639
try to drive that but it doesn't matter
it's the point is that analytics came

56
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,000
from the place that was kind of low-risk
we're trying to apply it to area that

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,870
Cyrus and that's very challenging so we
shouldn't expect it to be the magic

58
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,069
bullet or just a also solve our problems
or even a significant number of problems

59
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,639
i think that's an important distinction
and there's a number of reasons for that

60
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,060
and that these anything you compare
freaking industry kind of come out

61
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,159
naturally so there's one of the high
possible but the other problem is that

62
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:26,770
the output starts from analysts are
sorry starts from the data sciences and

63
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,940
give it to the animals

64
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,110
it is very different because if you're
looking at the retail industry is going

65
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,289
to start from the data scientist and the
day scientists will interpret results

66
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,550
here we have this handout that occurs
getting that a little bit and then we

67
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,840
also have some serious problems with
data and challenges of making a data

68
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,669
usage so I wanted to use a specific
example or the analytics so that we

69
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,938
don't know just talking about the you
know the entire body work all the time

70
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,860
i'm going to focus in on one as an
example chart to show sort of the pros

71
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,810
and cons so for credential misuse at
before we can even start doing that

72
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,599
first we need to break down the problem
and understand how would you even go

73
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,020
about doing it so there's a number of
different things to do to start with let

74
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,520
your spine all the and that's a
non-starter and some smaller

75
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,698
environments just getting centralized
logging stuff like that could be very

76
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:22,990
difficult

77
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,270
that's something here in my heart and so
for me I have a good answer for that but

78
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,500
it's for a lot of organizations drinking
and then after that you still have to

79
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,789
identify the contents within the context
you have to identify the actor in the

80
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,500
target and finally drive intent and the
derivation of the tent is very difficult

81
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,419
sometimes impossible but even taking
that context and finding your actor

82
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,729
replies that you know a lot about and
the other thing is that whenever you're

83
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,139
dealing with analytics this is all the
stuff that happened all of your security

84
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,719
sort of did its job for better or worse
so these are all things that passed so

85
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,310
the firewall said it's all good

86
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,490
login was authenticated

87
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,880
you know technically even authorized all
those kinds of things

88
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,650
so this is all the stuff that already
had a shock potentially bad thing down

89
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,960
didn't do its job and this is what's
left

90
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,250
we have to kind of remember that so
we're trying to figure out that you know

91
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:27,960
three things the target you actor intent
so breaking things down like this is

92
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,989
really the fundamental process of making
something correct

93
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,020
now let's look at sort of the opposite
so sometimes you know it's a it's easier

94
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,990
to describe to them by saying that it
isn't so we'll start with that

95
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,779
so something that might be impractical
and again if you've seen the situation

96
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,189
where this works

97
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,820
yes there are situations where any of
the usual things were the question is

98
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,560
how often should you be trying to
recreate that situation so how about

99
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,719
specific situations like penis Colin it
has a sporadic business

100
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,649
ok so you're going to see a lot more
exploit kit activity than your dns

101
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,790
tunneling it may work but there's going
to be a lot fewer times whether that's

102
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,439
more or less value will depend on your
organization but from a work perspective

103
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,709
and you're saying what should we be
going after if you're looking at a

104
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,569
purely incidental case then you know
where so it was more incidents of this

105
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,010
kind of this so we have pretty high
opportunity cost of pursuing it

106
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,680
this is true not just for being as
telling you one example but anytime

107
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,040
you're saying i'm going to be building
an electric goes after this one thing

108
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,510
you run the risk of saying well okay
we're gonna spend a lot of time is one

109
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,819
thing that shift I mean thank you very
quickly in our industry so the other way

110
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,339
there might be practical takes a lot of
doing

111
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,700
it's not that it won't work you
definitely do it

112
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,079
data exhales a good example so if you
have you're looking at traffic anomalies

113
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,849
you know first thing you do is our house
about the you know the ftp server your

114
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,720
flat front all that kind of stuff

115
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,699
and then he added to the whitelist i
have a white this problem that will work

116
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:07,029
but it's gonna take time and there's a
lot of places where things can fail

117
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,769
because you have more moving parts there
i might also be from practice

118
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,519
cost-prohibitive there are a ton of
analytics which works really well on

119
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,500
million couple million 10 million events
those kind of things we start doing in

120
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,310
millions

121
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,628
it's totally beautiful some of the
things that I've seen the similarity

122
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,259
clustering analysis lot of different
ways to do that in the vast majority

123
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:35,259
require an n-by-n is in all events times
all events so you start with a hundred

124
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:43,240
they balance so that's that could be a
real challenge to try to get from a POC

125
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,649
into something that is going to work for
the company all the time and it's you

126
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:53,709
may be looking at very different
proposition that point and then I think

127
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,989
this is probably the most common it's
difficult to acquire the data and even

128
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,639
within that there's data quality issues
so as I said at the beginning that I

129
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,660
wasn't super sure about my position when
I started this talk when I had a hunch

130
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,149
and I got way more sure when i came
across this paper here the site it's

131
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:19,180
it's a paper that Google delivered a
lecture at Stanford and 2014 believe and

132
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,819
they they really underscored all the
issues that I seem to see and maybe feel

133
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:29,769
a lot more confident in my opinions and
I have a couple that's never good

134
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,959
diagramming a bit but these are some of
the things that they saw that so long

135
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,388
normalization really underappreciated a
million different that parsing is the

136
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:45,670
first step but then even after that your
thoughts on issues along like a domain

137
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,920
user likes of the main / user versus the
user trying to trying to match up to set

138
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,839
you say well when the user was the same
if they are prefixed a different rate or

139
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,500
coming two different systems or maybe
have a middle initial all those kinds of

140
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,699
things that act let me that will trip up
here analytical or even start so that's

141
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,089
a real issue with more data time to
answer our problem

142
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,530
multi-line logs or normalization issue
and then just having the right-field job

143
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:17,089
then the other problems being able to
explain what happened

144
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,500
so it's not a very practical analytic
for security because you can't explain

145
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,270
what occurred neural networks are prime
example of this they give you some

146
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,880
really cool stuff they had enough to get
sort of a museum and results like this

147
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,960
is really cool and then if you try to
say well how do you know this thing is

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,960
bad then your analyst says well why was
it bad

149
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,579
it's almost impossible to clean it
because definition of why it's bad is

150
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,380
the entire training set and it's not
even that is labeled and unlabeled is

151
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,950
that because of this it might be like
two million records then it's this very

152
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,240
difficult position put your security
analyst in and they probably won't be as

153
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,630
inclined to ask for that kind of result
of the future

154
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:08,210
it just adds to the overall problem this
was called a black box problem that this

155
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:14,990
paper so the other problem is you have
accuracy vs generality so if you start

156
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,160
with something like okay it's pretty
good salt all over hitting those targets

157
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,150
you're using a cool collagen Syrian
conferences remember

158
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:34,640
okay so guys talking about over hitting
this is about this so yeah that you over

159
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,350
to use something that kind of work to
start with all this way this way this

160
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,210
way and that was working but now it's
very specific and if you think about

161
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,580
sort of over specialization leading to
extinction and Patrick had talked about

162
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:56,420
evolution in that that's very true in
this kind of sense so at certain points

163
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,329
going to become less useful right and
a-rod summer put it very well I said you

164
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,690
might notice that you now know enough
about the activity looking for that you

165
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,530
don't need and machine learning and what
he meant by that was by the time you get

166
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,339
so many times where you end up with his
rule not any limit

167
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,170
so we'll call this start

168
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,139
so when you have a ton of events to
start with you do a really good job you

169
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,810
get down to one percent that's still
kind of alerts and so Google found that

170
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:36,349
they can always narrow down to 52 1% of
employed things you know an internal

171
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:43,250
audit but it's still 500 boys day so
they call the signal and the way that

172
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,339
this manifest itself is just too many
alerts for the sock

173
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:53,870
ok so that's all the things i would take
what not to do but some of the problems

174
00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:00,589
so let's look at attempting to make this
practical and this is kind of if you

175
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,740
have your data scientists have you got
your bitch workout already made it might

176
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,779
start reaching now so this is these are
things that say okay well we're not

177
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,120
going to do things that we said don't
always work now we're gonna try to make

178
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,790
a practical so here we go let's try to
solve a credential this problem so we

179
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,129
knew standard learning then and so the
first problem is getting data sets

180
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,660
because especially if you're in I our
organization you don't really know

181
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,129
what's in your very first set

182
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:33,050
so you might go on ground and there's
already is occurring so you have nothing

183
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,639
to base your ground truth is
contaminated and when you're in any

184
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,829
organization is very difficult say yes i
100% sure that we don't already have no

185
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:47,149
beginning is a bad activity going on
right now so saying that you're gonna

186
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:52,220
look for a difference between then and
now definitely has it's also very

187
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,519
difficult to extract the right features
another callback to Patrick sake talk

188
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,480
about strings get those numbers to do it
can be done but takes a lot of time and

189
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,220
it's it's very easy to start putting too
many features and the cost of all goes

190
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,500
up it just it start you start to get
into this spiral like I do this and I

191
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,620
got to this is never getting that kind
of goes back to the opportunity cost of

192
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,250
it

193
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,050
so then the straight-up machine learning
on this is actually pretty and same

194
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,990
thing with with predicted behaviour this
would be if you take mp3 one user will

195
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,400
say well they did this and then so
because they done this in the past we

196
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,360
can expect it to be you know this is
such in the future and if it's in

197
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,160
deviate by more than a certain amount
then we want to learn and that works a

198
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,569
lot of the time back to google . you
know maybe 99% of time that's right but

199
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,600
at any given point in time there's a
number of people on vacation

200
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,260
there are a number of people having
something weird in their own lives

201
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,200
occurring maybe you know 11 the hospital
along with some beer so weird things

202
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,110
happen to one percent of people all the
time and that makes it that that makes

203
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,760
it such that it's actually normal to
have one percent you put it that way so

204
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,170
it's it's it's not malicious to have one
percent of things being weird all the

205
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:22,400
time which means you know within that
one percent we have that signal and this

206
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,680
again if you try to do that you have
every possible logging try to look at

207
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,069
work

208
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,220
the logging does now so there is not to
say they should never use this kind of

209
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,120
addictive behaviors or supervised
learning you could definitely use them

210
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,830
as long as you're going to zoom in and
helpful manner so phenomenally detection

211
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,510
as long as you're willing to deal with a
lot of the alerts that pull one percent

212
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,750
that's okay i mean that's better than
ninety-nine percent right so let's get

213
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,930
the one-percent let's do something with
it the same thing you can do with

214
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:00,110
clustering stuff so I an example would
be like subnet scoring you can get you

215
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,760
no more than five bad guys in the same /
14 ok will market 24 back you know

216
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,550
that's that those are some basic things
you can do

217
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,889
you're not silver bullets not going to
make an alert on that but they can

218
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,960
definitely help and that's kind of the
foundation of practically lives that's

219
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,660
saying we're going to do something
that's going to get a closer but we're

220
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,560
going to admit up front that is not
going to give us a bad guy right up

221
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,480
front so what are the what are sort of
the hallmarks here easy to compute C

222
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,160
understand it's easy to convey you can
do all three of those things then you

223
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,990
there's a very good chance that we're
doing

224
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,559
practical and that it's not going to
take too much time that you definitely

225
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,740
the right back so i said i kinda get
back to that paper and from there

226
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,690
diagram i thought this is really good so
if you have a rules engine that's on the

227
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,870
bottom it starts from the security
writing rules they put it through rules

228
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,678
engine and they get alerts out that the
security team looks that works very well

229
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,300
it will be blood are evaluating but if
you and we're starting software

230
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,710
engineers to go to feature engineering
and feature extraction and investor that

231
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,480
stuff and then you get alerts and as I
said before when back-trace all that

232
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,630
something gets lost in translation and
that's that's one of the big challenges

233
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:23,840
so how do we actually great start the
practical so start with the Act will get

234
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,610
by our experience like I know what that
looks like as I see little lunch right

235
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,360
so you start with the knowledge then you
have to add in appropriate amounts of

236
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,030
data for a lot of places very tricky

237
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,520
I just getting this large enough sample
sizes of anything it is fairly

238
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,900
containable a lot smaller organizations
and then having the technology and scale

239
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,640
it and it doesn't be just like building
it once he's running it day in day out

240
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,110
of stock grade scenario which is a lot
different than just getting it running

241
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,610
on your laptop once so that you can do
all three of those things that you

242
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,689
regret it so if you're working on
something like that don't know work all

243
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,320
the time it's a lure you know in our
environment you know it's not that you

244
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,350
shouldn't do it necessarily but it's
being practically might not get all the

245
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:16,850
values so they don't play anything good
or bad it was a heated just say what

246
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,510
happened

247
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,850
kinda reminds me of the difference
groans suricata and some ways the bro

248
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,120
will just describe what happens on
networks are accountable and stuff is

249
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,360
war did practically not quite ground
truth because of all the problems that

250
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,309
go with that and this is the key one
they're rarely actual by themselves so I

251
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,389
feel like they're often overlooked
because you know

252
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,320
stakeholder confidence that we need a
way to find this you just saw this are

253
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,399
right about this or guys in the ground
so we've been seeing this will be

254
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,360
something that finds this and that's not
the right way to go ad you need a much

255
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:01,209
more building block approach so how what
would be the actual question either

256
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,030
isn't worn one of the key word there if
you put some of them together then maybe

257
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:12,580
camp so let's look at what happens if we
tried to just take the actual practical

258
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,169
analytic are doing by itself if you say
alright well it's practical to be able

259
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,000
to say this Locker has never happened
before

260
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,920
it's really easy to figure out everyone
understands it but it's very noisy and

261
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,420
like i said before people on vacation
novel situations arise so you're saying

262
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,630
that a lot has never happened before
something that starts out being

263
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,550
practical but you don't get too much
value of it you could say anomalous that

264
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,840
so many things for having the same time
like spice right very easy to calculate

265
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,300
spikes or millions of tools and using
spikes but their religious reasons for

266
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,050
that happening and so you can't just say
well we spy something is absolutely

267
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,610
incident but we're getting closer
because we filled all those walmart

268
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,860
right easy to compute you can maybe
understand so we've got something we

269
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,530
need to be able to put those things
together get something that's gonna

270
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,000
definitely provide value you know day in
day out and this is the foundation of

271
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,940
set intersection analytics I get props
to a local brewery in madison wisconsin

272
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:21,070
president and they have boxes here with
us on the side of it and like I must use

273
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,370
this picture this picture is amazing

274
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:32,260
whenever I feel like the kitty kitty
kitty kitty

275
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:40,240
so you can do it could do so I approach
this like a lot of things

276
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,980
modular building blocks so the UNIX
philosophy and so we're going to each

277
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,600
analytical thinking well never gonna
combine them like you would have a scrip

278
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,189
pipe and then hopefully then we're going
to get something that's reproducible

279
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,080
valuable the way only you can think
about is something called strange pairs

280
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,570
so that's negative two lists and its
really calm really coming to ba1 really

281
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,939
common to be on the other coming to be
involved i think actually coming to be

282
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:17,200
supportive actually comedy wide receiver
very you guys want for all references to

283
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:26,440
start let me know i can do start writing
so then you have the other major part of

284
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:34,390
this is that so it's not unusual to
combine these things but the novel sort

285
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,500
of approach here is that if you assume
upfront that must combine them

286
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,030
it opens doors to going after things
explaining people don't know any time to

287
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,408
work on this even though your actual
results require patience is not usually

288
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:51,789
with Hitler's one here and but start
showing real value that way and so to

289
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:55,480
approach something knowing that it's not
going to give you final answer is a very

290
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,240
powerful even but as simple thing

291
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,450
so what does kinda look like from flow
and you have read that back right

292
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,200
probably not alright so on the Left we
have detection objectives so just what

293
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,520
are we trying to do here and then in the
middle we have a combination of set a

294
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,860
and set B come from this case events and
then you do some little bit of analysis

295
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,678
you might do a little bit of filtering
threshold things are just very

296
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,390
statistical kinds of things and then the
output and this is kind of critical is

297
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,030
an event and back to the not being
opinionated but being factual this is

298
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,408
important because events can be sent
back through the whole system so you

299
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:43,780
kind of get some commodity building
block out of the whole thing that means

300
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,230
that not only can you put two things
together you can put your things

301
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,230
together different points in time

302
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,190
so let's look at the advantages here
specifically are we dressing or signal t

303
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,480
I'm arguing

304
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,660
yes now we have a way to deal with any
kind of like the output list because we

305
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,590
have a way to filter them and so as an
example if you have a ton of service

306
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:12,540
accounts and you filter to just first
time logins suddenly you have a lot less

307
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,350
first time login a lot of service
accounts to worry about you might just

308
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:23,189
be into that signal to win it and so I
was saying that this is a way to start

309
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,860
approaching problems knowing you're not
going to final answer

310
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,219
step this is basically saying they're
going to take stuff that was previously

311
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,680
unviable and making a viable so before I
was saying all weekend Eugene learning

312
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,150
as i get your final answer

313
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,380
it's okay the building block in the
whole system this is where it's not that

314
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,850
math is wrong or bad it's just that it's
only one piece of the overall puzzle and

315
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,649
if you know that going in

316
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,600
you're going to no proper we're gonna
also need to design this data we're

317
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,010
going to need to put all those things
together and this has a lot of

318
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,629
repercussions so suddenly stop that was
unimportant data become important you

319
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,260
have an opportunity to take advantage of
some things like that so if you're

320
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,330
looking at an overall set of events just
knowledge that was previously an

321
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,560
interesting theory purposes suddenly
becomes interesting so Louis development

322
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:21,389
download the exe download yes an
interesting but you put together my time

323
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,630
frame that might actually become sort of
interesting if you're looking at a

324
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:31,800
dropper scenario from BFX clip so this
kind of idea that these are start

325
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,070
creating your own laundry list very easy
to collect things suddenly become

326
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,210
valuable when you look in the small
building blocks so you get the book from

327
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:44,460
other analytic modules list of users my
job role suddenly just the list of

328
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,140
people who have access to easy transfer
systems that becomes really important

329
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,540
Ellison list of people who are vacation
based on work outlook says out of office

330
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,909
that could be interesting

331
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:01,130
again you that in and of itself not that
interesting right list of assets that

332
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,390
are previously compromise this is like
my favorite ones you know did that did

333
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,420
it really remediated box that we will
attack two weeks ago

334
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:15,860
let's check on that thing top riders by
the time spent browsing the last job is

335
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,629
studying for a couple months basically
found that these are confirmed incidence

336
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:26,840
for every 1,000 unique web pages you
went to there will be one in so it's

337
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,389
basically were Russian Roulette revolver
with a thousand chambers or whatever

338
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:38,240
ecology and so it was just a matter of
time you can pretty much predict how

339
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,410
many it'sit's you're going to have based
on how many URLs there were to the point

340
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,290
where i actually had a quota for my guys
that you can go home tell you found me

341
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,060
five incidents and it was actually
worked out pretty well but we give you

342
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:56,659
some techniques so just top topics
grantsburg and then just some basic list

343
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,790
about IP information was kind of stuff
you have that more as a lesson on a

344
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:07,520
condom and look up the Morrow's to set
really valuable information and then you

345
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,300
a little bit further combine those kind
of sets of profiling so asking very

346
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,530
specific questions that aren't they're
not going to give you the results this

347
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,870
is evil and i'm going to give you a
building block style answer so question

348
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,310
that asked to define whether or not
someone is an admin and question you can

349
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:30,320
say was an admin like TV and then by
finding set difference there you can

350
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,379
actually get something worth
investigating

351
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,600
ok so if you want to decide you want to
do something that Island you know is

352
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,409
that sounds like something pretty
advanced not necessarily you could pick

353
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,220
set of websites you know not read it

354
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,360
that's you know a little bit more
widespread but if you go to stack

355
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,959
overflow you have enough probably
develop those kinds of things you know

356
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,100
maybe go once or twice maybe not but you
say you don't you go 10 times a week

357
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,639
there's a really really good chance your
developer that's not mr. like some

358
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,870
machine learning thing right

359
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,250
it's like a sequel query but now you
have this list of people who are

360
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,210
probably developers that's that

361
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,210
that's really practical to do an
invaluable

362
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,490
did you do any kind of already a chance
for admin if you're constantly traveling

363
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,049
all all over then your higher risk your
business traveler did you download a

364
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,279
whole bunch of files

365
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,690
well by definition you're you're
archival stop you from archives software

366
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,210
but that's really what you're doing or
not doesn't matter

367
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,899
x factor definition that's what you so
what we have here with the framework of

368
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:41,729
building blocks is a bridge between the
analysts start the analytics and the

369
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,419
analyst so when I was saying that while
the data scientists create these

370
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,320
analytics and then hope that the output
is valuable to the analyst this is what

371
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,470
gets you around that problem so you
could still going to need some help

372
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,029
learning stuff like this at scale from
data scientists or at least from having

373
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,539
infrastructure that supported but by
using that framework as the bridge

374
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:05,279
between the two worlds could really have
a more meaningful conversation and more

375
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,929
meaningful of development requirements
with them because you could say this is

376
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:13,380
exactly what I need and this is exactly
what I need and you'll know how that got

377
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,470
and that's the critical step so no
analytics talk i think is pleased about

378
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:25,200
the obligatory visualizations for those
used on my talk yesterday at security

379
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,250
onion some of this water with that was
on purpose so i think that visualization

380
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,059
really helped me handle it usable this
is specifically in the early buildings

381
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,840
on when you're trying to figure out you
know is like your profile for Disease

382
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,459
look like now I'll give a shout-out to
edward tufte number of books and all 11

383
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,010
someone inside mostly here and i
actually find the library so some of

384
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,820
those technical references get library
if you're you know if it's the

385
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,899
difference between you know spend money
on this book or not read it there is a

386
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,760
middle ground and you do like library
lot so if you were going to read it at

387
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,179
all you might please check library so he
has a few basic points if you like is

388
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,789
the PSA is important the same i have
readable sets labels at the system board

389
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,860
points tried it try to speed things up
for the user right you try to make

390
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,219
quick as possible so there's something
that you know is important then make it

391
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,030
important on the chart i'll just put it
up there and then don't use more screens

392
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:34,010
basis so if you're having a talking bear

393
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:39,890
I have some thoughts about that words
gonna hate me so I think the dashboards

394
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:47,600
are critical for giving you a budget and
the reason i think that is if you are

395
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,659
going to dashboard to see if something's
wrong

396
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,950
you're probably looking for spike for
something in this change and that is

397
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,090
something that can be scripted and then
you can get back to it so that my

398
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,230
opinion on that sometimes don't have the
skills that in-house and okay I get it

399
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:09,230
but that to me she can goal is that a
well-oiled socks should have anybody

400
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,950
looking at the board should be
responding to alert somebody come in if

401
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,330
you management I get it

402
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,010
I'm not gonna say don't make them
absolutely need to make some of them but

403
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,000
as an analyst day i would i would find
it unfortunate if you're spending a lot

404
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,440
of time boards

405
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,419
however if you're going to make them
make them right and these are some of

406
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:32,299
the ones that the reason medicate them
is because they look mad or anything

407
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,710
it's that you can just look at them and
have any census what's going on

408
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,730
so you have to hover over every little
thing to see what the you know what's in

409
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,080
the legend and that's not going to save
anybody and that's just like okay we

410
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,199
have some charts so this is why I'm such
a fan

411
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:55,010
Sankey shows same data that was in the
charts we have you know subsections or

412
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,570
some sectors but it's gonna show not
only the amounts and how much they vary

413
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,809
by going to show the connectivity
between them is a whole other dimension

414
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:05,960
that provides and you can actually read
it

415
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,320
that's what I love about you can take
one look at this you know

416
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,649
ok that picking the middle got a lot of
connections you can hover over that

417
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,260
really need to see how much it is but it
doesn't really matter you're not

418
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,120
interested in the total now you can see
by any one of those kind of snack bar

419
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,120
graphs exactly where the stuff going

420
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,600
you should save a lot of time to time
based controls and of having a user

421
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,010
clicks a whole bunch of times

422
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,550
much nicer to have savable zooming right
in the

423
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,419
I don't you can see the entire time and
if you stop you see a very specific

424
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,330
section and I was really just getting
out of the way so can't even tell me

425
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,990
where this morning

426
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:55,700
this is the handwriting is figuring out
the first time in human history there

427
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,800
around Jupiter you did it with a little
piece of glass and the two and a quill

428
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,419
and paper and I think you've had a lot
because it's very inspiring and it's

429
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,429
inspiring because he was told the entire
time he was wrong and I thought that was

430
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:17,090
it's something that it's very exciting
so what he's doing here is each day

431
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,880
going out plotting with funny little
things that doesn't know what they are

432
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,480
and they won but when he gets down to
think about the 13-14 dancing like you

433
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,840
know what there seems to be sort of a
corkscrew motion here there's something

434
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,510
actually we're gonna replace and i mean
the the inspirational part side i

435
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,250
thought this was a neat way of showing a
time-based stuff especially as a changes

436
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,810
so I thought it'd be really fun to have
a visualization that goes shows log into

437
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,980
that way for if you're zeroing in on
just users that this would be a good way

438
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,929
to show anomalies especially across days
normally see this in a calendar format

439
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:02,420
and I think that can be valuable special
line them up like sword a week but i

440
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,130
think this really gets you her time of
day Harrison I like this method

441
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:16,760
alright so put it all together analytics
are not magic order to that so how would

442
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:24,110
we do this with our practical analytics
here for conventions use are so what I I

443
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:30,230
look after this word a way to show this
sets with visualization on it so there's

444
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,000
six different list there and what I did
for this was rigged up backing queries

445
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,590
so that whenever boxes checked up there
it would on that data and merging

446
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,450
together and so you would like increase

447
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:48,078
accounts so the bottom the x-axis is the
username so everything going across is

448
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,020
the same user or sorry the everything
going across is going to turn everything

449
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,940
into columns singing because the x-axis
and then the y-axis is the number of

450
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,349
hosts that they logged in to start
hosting locked into the size of the .

451
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:09,410
number so that the lower left there you
have the same user logging in a whole

452
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:14,000
bunch 21 host and then the morning .
above a their logging in a little bit

453
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,930
less that's still a lot to different
post and then those kinds of great lines

454
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,950
that you have across there are the same
username logging in once to a whole

455
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,970
bunch of house so the idea was alright
let's let's put a bunch of these

456
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,700
building blocks together and we don't
know which ones are going to give us

457
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,970
something interesting but we're going to
provide format that we can play your

458
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,399
hunches very quickly so start by
checking you say alright let's look at

459
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,839
the intersection of our users service
accounts first time logins and source

460
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,049
code servers and it gets a little bit
more interesting you already ruled out

461
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,730
the colors web server so the big hitters
are gone you kind of counted for those

462
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:56,000
but star left punch so you have four
four two three four users to play with

463
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,990
their alright so what if you go down
even further now we're just looking at

464
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,000
first time login to source code servers
and you only have one time that happened

465
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,920
now you have your out of signal . you do
something that you can actually start to

466
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,390
investigate and maybe if this happens a
lot you can actually make a fool out of

467
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:25,609
that process so in conclusion the best
analytics simple once and I think this

468
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:29,150
is probably the easiest way with this if
your analytics starts to look a lot like

469
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,210
reporting you're probably on the right
track

470
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:39,050
it's sort of a big takeaway and the
morning is very underrated protection

471
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:44,420
purposes and then assume that your
analytics you're going to need help

472
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,440
so make sure that the output from those
analytics is something like an event

473
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,500
that goes into your normal analysis
workflow

474
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,820
having way too often you see the output
from the analytic is like even of itself

475
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,100
with the deliverable you have no way to
go further into that the filter and then

476
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:07,190
that result easily communicate use it
itches it an event that's an output

477
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:12,410
while clearly begin UK because just like
any other piece of data and then I think

478
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,859
you need good visualizations at some
level to be able to understand what's

479
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,590
going on there and I think they're
effective interface especially in the

480
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:25,850
early stages for playing with them
figuring out when triangle that's it

481
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:42,230
then take questions but this you're
providing the center and is validated

482
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,010
sensors fashion line

483
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,930
surely you're building a machine

484
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:57,020
ok I mean bequest make sure I got it
right so do you take the apple from some

485
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,610
of these analytics and tweak the sensors
that are great inputs so that you get

486
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,560
better analytics

487
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,990
well not really and this kind of to the
first part if you have to tweak the

488
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,899
input then it's not as practical anymore
so I think the best ways to try to

489
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,050
sidestep that if you're enjoying it
that's kind of the point if you're

490
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,560
tweaking a lot of stuff to get your
analytic work and become the practical

491
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:37,070
table design problem where is this
knowledge

492
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:48,370
it's nice especially where the features
that generation is not a scientist last

493
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:54,790
one was not minding your legs

494
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:06,460
yes that's an excellent point / question
I that strongly case i feel that a lot

495
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,280
of times there's both some styling that
goes on i think most works but beyond

496
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,750
that that's kind of the point that
bridge picture was that you need almost

497
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:23,800
a language or green words to communicate
between two disciplines and so why each

498
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,890
group kind of meeting in the middle
where you hear your analyst you know

499
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,850
we're all smart folks we can do
something that we can figure out some

500
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,870
stuff but we don't have all day to their
research papers so if you can get it to

501
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:40,210
us in you know something like standard
deviation average some statistical

502
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,050
functions we're going to understand you
can get it seems that way we're good and

503
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,940
the other side they certainly know how
to do that so if you kind of have the

504
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,380
smaller building blocks that don't
require you know nearly as much machine

505
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,160
learning and training sets these kinds
of things you can have much shorter

506
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,149
conversations and more quality
conversations between the two and once

507
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,630
you start getting some successes there i
think that the team just sort of

508
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,110
naturally start to communicate more and
I think you know the problem starts to

509
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,650
solve itself like that you're the
interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing

510
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:20,560
really starts to lhasa great question
question tackles all of them

511
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:29,560
challenges are welcome yes arts practice

512
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,860
alright what do that any other questions

513
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,510
alright i have a couple of Giveaways
here I should have made this the

514
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:57,010
question out but there was a previous
also had and it was how you know if an

515
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,030
analytic is practical related but
slightly different than three points

516
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:07,090
okay go yeah-yeah-yeah

517
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:40,320
ok one more book to give away like a
dear colleague originated like what are

518
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:47,460
the two kinds of Sheila's parents
