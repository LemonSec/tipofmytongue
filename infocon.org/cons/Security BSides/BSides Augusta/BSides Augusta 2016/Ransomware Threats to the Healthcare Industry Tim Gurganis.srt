1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,110
stream and religious having your table
or leaders and last count over summer ii

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:23,369
as well use ok thank you and your cables
currently i work for cisco systems as a

3
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,930
security investigator the past couple
years I worked a lot with healthcare

4
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,660
companies that have been affected by
ransomware attacks so i want to share my

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,760
observations about some of the common
vulnerabilities we don't care industry

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:47,010
and also talked about the active attacks
using ransomware that I'm so here's the

7
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,309
quick outlining Oh back on the first
slide this presentation is online on my

8
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,809
box account has also put up on
SlideShare just this morning he searched

9
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,209
for long ransomware healthcare you
probably find it going to have this link

10
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,250
again at the end so i want to talk about
common vulnerabilities in healthcare

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,220
that I've observed what Cisco sata3
analytics team does that long as we

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,400
monitor the networks of our customers so
we have a full recap tab we have long

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,890
collection and so forth so that's how
we'll get visibility is near there never

14
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,920
into a monitor their security will talk
a little bit about the mass distributed

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,070
attacks ransomware as well as targeted
attacks and also at the end talk about

16
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,960
some recommendations and response
questions so due to the increasing cost

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,729
of providing healthcare healthcare is
adopting a lot of new technology to

18
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,869
provide better care to patients and to
reduce the cost of providing that care

19
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,399
so you see a lot of new computerized
equipment i'll be running into the

20
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,540
hospitals because they want to eliminate
paper and the inefficiencies and call

21
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,170
clickers that . so you have a EMR
systems or electronic health record

22
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,420
systems that are being installed
hospitals are not working together to

23
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,420
reduce costs and increase efficiency
these systems are being designed for

24
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,459
functionality and reliability but not
necessarily security hardin and so that

25
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,940
leaves the network vulnerable to some
cyber attacks just some observations

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,310
from customers i worked with half of
them when we started our relationship

27
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,340
didn't have an incident response team
had some way when we do our

28
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,180
investigation will never friends
instance in the next assessment know

29
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,450
that we have to turn it over to the
customer and we would ask them okay

30
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,450
who's going to be the more personal . in
your ID security team to go receive

31
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,089
these investigations and and work with
us to mitigate threats so they often

32
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,590
that was a process they had to begin
when they started you know another

33
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,360
relationship and we were doing their
monitor and so that's one thing they

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,430
really weren't prepared for some not go
cyber attack another thing is that

35
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,019
they're all running equipment that is
connected to some type of older version

36
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,850
of windows might be an MRI machine that
has a interface that is running windows

37
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:34,060
but often in the machine working find
the excellent care but the operating

38
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,010
system controller is no longer supported
no longer patched as as a result many

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,340
security vulnerabilities also hospitals
networks are divers the average hospital

40
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,850
has 50 different kinds of devices so
everything from horrible database server

41
00:03:51,850 --> 00:04:01,690
to heart rate monitor to a lab machine
that does blood gas measurement or

42
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,370
something so you have all these texts
computerized devices that can plug into

43
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,420
the networks may they were not designed
to be on never be and it is not

44
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,530
time to be secure on network they don't
have authentication they also going to

45
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,250
use encryption and they don't get
security patches another observation is

46
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,190
the fancy stafford hospital is generally
smaller than also be and they're very

47
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,070
busy ocio hospital may have a hundred
200 active projects some of the security

48
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,080
lady most were not and so it's very
difficult in some cases to get the right

49
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,760
visibility to security threats to get
the dollars allocated allocated and the

50
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,510
buying from the sea level to solve some
of these problems so what are some

51
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,380
common vulnerabilities that I reserve
first of all they're still using shared

52
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,500
passwords for things like service
accounts and a lot of cases particularly

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,930
those used on what his State embedded
controllers or our back-end systems that

54
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,110
do better use for many council used for
payments but they allow access to the

55
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,630
system and therefore to the network

56
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:17,300
there's no use of encryption most of the
devices only a lot of blogging so we do

57
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,220
have an incident is not a whole lot to
do forensics on but it also means that

58
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,400
your detection for taxes was not very
good

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,770
they have weaker Claudia encryption that
is there a key link is to shore the

60
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,409
algorithm using the non-secure have poor
randomization some of the basic laws

61
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,630
that you know have been solved in other
verticals but have yet to be addressed

62
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,840
often with the medical devices they
often if they're running applications

63
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,700
they have remote file including owner
abilities from SQL injection

64
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,099
vulnerabilities and you just know the
basic common vulnerabilities that we see

65
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:06,560
and these uh are not being patched I
know I'm cases because the hospital

66
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,010
doesn't have the resources to test the
matches

67
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,219
plus they have a lot of applications to
test that i said already they're still

68
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,790
using devices with out-of-date operating
systems can be older version

69
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,810
linux as well as the news but the ones
that are causing those problems will be

70
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,990
windows there's not much authentication
to put a device on the network

71
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,210
there's also not segmentation in there
so once you get on

72
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,570
even simple like a hvac building
controller online it can actually talk

73
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:49,310
to a lot of the other networks in the
hospital putting uvr lab the the admin

74
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,530
area and so forth so this is a problem
because once that aggregates inside the

75
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,590
network here for you around and do
lateral movement there's no use of neck

76
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:07,729
which is something our event to another
challenge is they have so many distinct

77
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,470
19 teams so that one hospital I was that
recently they said they have five teams

78
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,360
they have the IT team development lab
equipment and they actually calibrated

79
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,470
the machines as well as to network
administration just for the lab machines

80
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,710
that did your blood tests and embalming
fluid test and various analysis that you

81
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,099
need to do and then we have the admin
systems which was HR and and payroll and

82
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,200
kind of thing and then they have the
clinical ite group that they did

83
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,690
administration of the things that
actually touching patients so this was

84
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,000
all your monitoring equipment for their
pulse ox their heart rate and so forth

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,100
and then you have left the building and
physical security group so this was

86
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,100
people who have promised and network
security camera system that and then

87
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,030
take these words and talk to each other
and so one of them for example the

88
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,630
building manager people to put Monica
hvac controller on the network and menus

89
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,640
and vulnerabilities and now you're
exposing that that admin systems and in

90
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,500
the lab systems to that that potential
attack and so this is a challenge that

91
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,810
saying in a number of health care

92
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,930
zation what's been the impact of these
muscle every one of my customers as some

93
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,099
type of ransomware incident advanced
systems that were prepared to mostly by

94
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,979
mass delivered ransomware such as
corrupt a wall test the Crypt lucky I

95
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,700
was common way that I've seen the being
in infected is to click on the link or

96
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,240
go to a website where there was no
advertising and this is back when

97
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,920
angular x1 kid was active and you see a
lot of inventions because they didn't

98
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,449
catch flash and they would get a
malicious download through their web

99
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,130
browser the second way is open email
attachments the mission i said

100
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,700
convention hospitals pass around a lot
of reports some of them were attached to

101
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,200
emails and it was very uncommon for
there in their business to open up these

102
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,570
attachments for watching the case of an
attack contain malicious macros that

103
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,300
would install ransomware i'm sending
five percent of medical institutions you

104
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,170
know believe they have or had been
victorious somewhere believe they have

105
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,510
been and so saying in general health
care is lagging in his defence and

106
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,800
protection from cyberattacks and this
puts your pii your personal information

107
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:50,969
here thi your healthcare information
peppers some other graphics this is from

108
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:57,750
a fire I blog the line at the top there
is the healthcare industry where they

109
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,260
saw attacks of this particular locky
ransomware going into healthcare network

110
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,620
and the graph is not linear and I'm
finding this very well then this is 50%

111
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,910
sovereignty percent in this one
particular campaign was going into

112
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,240
healthcare vertical below that you have
like telecom and transportation but this

113
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,310
is a common theme that I've seen much my
customers as well

114
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,640
I have customers that are not in
healthcare and the impact of ransomware

115
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,550
is his lower for them they're not
getting as many infections from these

116
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,800
particular types of attacks and
ransomware is they're continuing to grow

117
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,170
there's there's new families and there's
more actors or adversaries they're using

118
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,270
ransomware we've seen some adversaries
that were distributing the password

119
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,189
steelers or credit card

120
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,960
steelers that have switched to using
ransomware for monetizing their

121
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,600
activities so one example from
malwarebytes is the December last year

122
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,210
seven percent of all malware payloads
from export kit attacks ransomware but

123
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:14,960
by may of 2016 6 months later 61 percent
of those payrolls were around somewhere

124
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,980
this is the typical attack convincing
are seeing earlier this year hospital

125
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,290
staffer goes to this medical related
website the date an optometric company

126
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,040
and that particular website at the time
was compromised and there was a hidden

127
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,290
iframe on every page that would be
direct you to load this other compromise

128
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,730
website where you would be redirected to
the angler exploit kit so just by going

129
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,600
to this website which seems like a
reasonable thing for the hospital steps

130
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,240
to do they end up getting in this case
the Tesla crypt ransomware on that

131
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,490
machine so how the way exploit kits work
if you don't know once you get to the

132
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,660
landing page and you load that in your
web browser there's code on that page

133
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,230
that's going to determine the version of
flash that you have and the browser

134
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,920
using an operating system version and
it's going to select an exploit that

135
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,959
works against that first in this case
the hospital had like a golden image

136
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,150
there reason to install their PCs and I
have my flash version 11 which the new

137
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:29,930
one is like 21 and so my next point for
version 11 was downloaded and when it's

138
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,599
exceeded it downloaded

139
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,220
test equipment which is ransomware and
began drifting the machine we knew that

140
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,540
because we could see the communication
back to the command control URL which is

141
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:48,860
this telling channel calm and so this is
fairly typical we find that hospitals

142
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,589
have computers that are not to date and
they're also not patching them as i

143
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:58,490
mentioned earlier there often hundreds
of applications in a hospital and they

144
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,779
just don't have the resources to test
them all to make sure the patches don't

145
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,829
break something

146
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,849
and so that found that they're very
hesitant to want to patch but you know

147
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,440
after 10 out of this you know can
convince most of them to begin that

148
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,009
process but it will take time because of
the number of applications their

149
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:23,149
configurations testing we've also seen
infections come from staff using

150
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,079
personal email accounts on their
workstations in the hospital

151
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,359
usually they're not getting them from
the hospital's official email servers

152
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,880
but a lot of them are allowed to access
the personal email they are going to

153
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,279
attach tradition and the difference
somewhere that I just want to review

154
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,069
quickly some of the active ransomware
families so the first one is ripped XX

155
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,540
which is believed to have been developed
by the same group that wrote the

156
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,980
rebbetzin ransomware which was came out
years ago but this is a case where they

157
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,839
know had a adversary that's been
involved in our for a while and they

158
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,959
decided to write ransomware pavement
where they're disturbing in TX . kids as

159
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,739
well as available as email attachments
it has have some features to avoid

160
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,380
detection by automated sandboxes so it
will sit there I'll for like an hour and

161
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,350
then it will begin encrypting so that
you know will perhaps timeout the

162
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,310
sandbox also this so that the user
doesn't associate like opening that

163
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,888
email or going to that web page with
getting ransomware the two events happen

164
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:42,709
form of departmental coraline but
cryptex will also maybe

165
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,110
monitor for mouse moving or check the
name of the cpu in the registry in order

166
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,129
to determine whether it's in a sandbox
or whether it's on a real machine

167
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:59,459
cryptex will encrypt pausing the local
drive as well as those moment drives USB

168
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:05,518
devices or network shares if they can
write to him is going to try to in

169
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,189
addition to encryption functions cryptex
one also steal your passwords at rest

170
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:15,930
and your bitcoins can find it so it's
going through the process of looking for

171
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:23,128
stored passwords and shortcuts to your
web browser or dvd going so in addition

172
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:27,689
to dealing with all the ransomware
locations and restoring files after he

173
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:37,079
protects will change passwords another
active family is the server ransomware

174
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,469
server is distributed by was just email
attachment as well as by exploit kit and

175
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,089
I just had a few examples subjects from
campaigns that I've seen where server

176
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,439
was the payload of an email we notice
that they're kind of business related so

177
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:57,509
it could be the name of a company it
could be this user has shared a message

178
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:02,670
with you and it will lure you to open
the attachment or could be fake

179
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,279
file-sharing message the games that need
someone to share while an important file

180
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:17,519
with so these seem to be targeting more
business users than been saying server

181
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,839
has been the payload from literally
patent usually the form of the

182
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,970
attachment has the militias macros is a
word doc although they have experimented

183
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,750
with using RTF files as well as well as
using the river javascript downloaders

184
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,110
so in this case you have a zip file
attached to an email

185
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:46,110
sighs and JavaScript files for the small
and that script well execute when you

186
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,540
open it using the windows scripting
engine to download the ransomware and

187
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,649
then run it some interesting things
about servers command control

188
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:03,420
communications uses ute on this poor 689
to and you can see it scans a large

189
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,879
range of IP addresses one of these
seeing these three used and I think

190
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,880
that's just make it more difficult to
block the community

191
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:19,379
lastly we have the lockyer in somewhere
which i think is probably when I see the

192
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,370
most in terms of the mass distributed
this case seems to be exclusively

193
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:29,459
distributed by even though attachment
using the droid x botnet which used to

194
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,470
deliver the critics this dealer these
this particular body only runs on

195
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,980
weekdays so again some indication
they're targeting businesses because

196
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,980
businesses have money in advance

197
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,450
lucky uses an affiliate models you go
cooperating adversaries designing a

198
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,070
version of Lackey with their affiliate
and they're being distributed by the

199
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,809
decks profit they heard the graph of the
bottom here is the very first day locky

200
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,928
came out which is in February 2016 and
you can see that due to low detection by

201
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:09,809
antivirus the number of intentions rose
prop Rose quite a bit on the very first

202
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:17,850
day so a bit about ransomware
propagation so some people ask me does

203
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,559
ransomware spread from system the system
and none of the mass distributed

204
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,379
ransomware then I discovered has any
kind of spreader function built in and

205
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,429
so in cases where you've seen that
happen where initial infection occurred

206
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:39,990
and then spread to you know 20 40 60 pcs
a network there was some actor doing the

207
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,940
spreading we're using a script probably
but it was an intentional mission just a

208
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,429
target that particular Network have seen
this with crypto wall back when it was

209
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,000
acting

210
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,550
then they would get a special bill that
wasn't detected by antivirus just for

211
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,139
specific target because they already had
some remote access into that Network

212
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:10,350
often the spreaders use windows utility
copias exact which is handy for moving

213
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,780
files to another system once you have a
appropriate password and then kicking

214
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:24,540
off the encryption on those systems they
can access so in those scenarios where

215
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,420
is a targeted attack i'm seeing them
break into like a JBoss server which

216
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,100
wasn't patched and then they would . the
memory or source the memory of that

217
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,149
server looking for Active Directory
credentials and then once they had a

218
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,200
list of credentials they would scan
whenever to see where those worked then

219
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,670
would build a target list create the
keys are going to use to rip that that

220
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,320
particular target and then distribute
the ransomware and the keys and then

221
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,460
kick it off with a scheduled task so at
the same time throughout the hospital

222
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,150
they would run an encryption routine and
then this ransom note show display

223
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,730
saying that you had to pay 115 that
going / machine in order to get your

224
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,560
files back

225
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,110
this is what happened and the Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center in which you

226
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,919
may have heard about in the news but it
also happened in some other location of

227
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:28,200
some other hospitals some even in other
countries so here so story based on

228
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:38,760
actual incident on a sunday night the
hospital staff notice 19 problems

229
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,310
beginning computers showing strange
messages this particular Hospital had

230
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:51,510
ten large hospital locations and
actually like 300 partnerships or

231
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:59,400
off-site outpatient time locations and
they had over 370 applications that they

232
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,920
use the

233
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,140
about these these hospitals and clinics
so they follow their higher plan and

234
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,910
they began by our actions to to deal
with this or applications not working in

235
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,680
some form and they assess that by Monday
morning early that the situation is

236
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,620
getting worse and they had a ransomware
attack in this case they decided not to

237
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,639
pay the ransom and so they determined
that we need to shut off their

238
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,700
electronic health record system and that
effective force all of their locations

239
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,590
impacting patient care building
management system their ability to order

240
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,720
supplies and equipment so forth

241
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,830
no cases were put at risk by this but
they were definitely degraded in their

242
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:47,230
capabilities because they couldn't use
their computers some lessons learned

243
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:54,580
from this they said you know plan for
this to happen in your location because

244
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,840
it's happening everywhere as you see
healthcare institutions are are being

245
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:05,830
attacked by ransomware this is different
from a thi thi preach because you're

246
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,970
you're in denial of access to your
computers or soccer computer information

247
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:16,690
is being stone plan to have an incident
command center that coordinates all of

248
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,800
the now Manuel activities that you're
going to have because your computer

249
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,909
network is not available rehearse the
plan include an alternate communications

250
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,810
capability that is still hipaa-compliant
you know there was a temptation

251
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,260
everybody start just using your cell
phones to send emails and text messages

252
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,210
and communicate that way but so that
violates your compliance so you can't

253
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,290
can't just do that you have to have a
plan that is an alternative to the

254
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,580
normal number

255
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,570
normal way of doing things but it's
maintains that compliance another thing

256
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,580
that they had planned for was that the
recovery would take of 33 weeks so

257
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,320
within 72 hours they have restored
critical applications but it took a

258
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,030
whole three weeks before everything's
back to normal and so during that time

259
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:09,040
certain processes have been manually on
paper using a different special process

260
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,889
so if you've been rehearsing to have
like one application

261
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:20,960
go down now imagine what you would do if
they were all but this is what they they

262
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,820
went through another thing i've seen a
break answered i mentioned hvac controls

263
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,300
number of times because we have seen
some reaches for that was how they got

264
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,520
him and then due to no no segmentation
that was allowed the lateral movement

265
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,950
inside the network this may happen
because the remote access on the HPA

266
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,110
system is not here or may have been one
case we saw where the vendor support guy

267
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,939
came in use this formal sitting next to
the controller to read his personal

268
00:23:49,940 --> 00:24:00,320
email and got brought in the ransomware
i'm going to skip to slide about how how

269
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,379
we might get worse because i'm running
out of time

270
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,530
there are some hosts medications that i
have seen be effective ones you can

271
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,879
enable click to activate on your flash
plugin that way when you go to a page

272
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,760
that has those bands like this they are
run automatically will have to click on

273
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,940
in order to see'em this can be effective
in renting or making it require one more

274
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,750
step before those flashes exports will
just run when you go to the page

275
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,480
another is to change the way windows
handles javascript as i mentioned we're

276
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,520
now seeing the email attacks that the
attachment is a file contains a little

277
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,120
JavaScript whose sole function is to
download malware running on your

278
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,729
computer but there's really no purpose
for having a JavaScript email attachment

279
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,980
and so after email gateway if you can
block sips that just contains javascript

280
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,900
do it also change the way windows acts
when you click on the javascript file so

281
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,590
that have opened something innocuous
like notepad is that are running the

282
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,260
script on your system which would then
effectively assume there's no reason to

283
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,800
have javascript in the hospital so
you're not really reducing the

284
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,570
functionality of applications there are
some instructions on how to do it you

285
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,379
basically click right click on the
javascript file server that you pick an

286
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,370
application that's not the w script
interpreter but

287
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:34,580
in fact something harmless like uno
another idea is to use generic products

288
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,110
you can create some files on your
desktop and then have a monitor process

289
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,409
that anytime something tries to write to
those are in print him

290
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,140
it gets killed and this is the idea
behind this utility called anti ransom

291
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,600
which will do all that for you

292
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,209
solitary and soon it will create a dummy
folder of documents and if you get a

293
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,240
ransomware it sees those documents and
tries to encrypting little that process

294
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,530
will be killed and then it will display
was warming doesn't stop all encryption

295
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,570
but it'll stop most of it right because
it's there's no guarantee that the first

296
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,790
files the ransomware goes after or your
generic but when it gets those that

297
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,990
process gets killed

298
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:28,550
so this seems to be effective way to
based on the final activity identifier

299
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,620
and somewhere and stop some
recommendations I've already covered a

300
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,169
lot of these but you have a backup and
just your backup recovery patch flash

301
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:45,800
because it's the most commonly exploited
middle or application bachelor web

302
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:55,070
applications don't enable macros in your
office and tried using the click to

303
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:02,659
activate to disable flash except when
you specifically click on the content i

304
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,000
was the final thoughts and compliance
does not equal security so a lot of

305
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,600
hospitals has been a lot of money on
HIPAA compliance and other privacy

306
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,110
protections which are very important but
that doesn't mean that they're secure

307
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,428
and that there are not vulnerable to
cyberattacks get to know your

308
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,250
vulnerabilities on your network know
what's on your mind is running out

309
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,820
it's been scanning the network for two
months just to find out all the

310
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,360
different kinds of devices that got and
what operating system running because

311
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,000
they just didn't know and is it's
impossible to defend and protect your

312
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,910
systems if you don't know what they are
or what their vulnerabilities and then

313
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,200
have a comprehensive security policy
that addresses these vulnerabilities and

314
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,240
manages them to reduce your risk make
sure that includes your provider or your

315
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,270
partnerships you know off-site
facilities and clinics but I think I

316
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,710
don't give up with proper planning and
awareness executing your security

317
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:09,930
strategy your healthcare systems can be
protected and these are two places i put

318
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:24,120
this presentation slide share as well as
of my cisco box and i think that's it is

319
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,860
are there any burning questions i hope
you learned something I enjoyed

320
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:44,909
presenting here too yes sir I have not
seen anything like that that that is one

321
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,540
of mine

322
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,970
what if it gets worse predictions is
that you could see ransomware actors

323
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,850
threatening to do I have a breach

324
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,800
you don't pay the ransom and so that
hasn't happened but it's conceivable

325
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,830
letting are taking him

326
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,270
you don't have to appreciate it
