1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
yeah I get up I called everybody this is
a hard this is adventures and red

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,939
letters are using permanent reminder
security consultant median former

3
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,710
lieutenant turned red

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,699
I live in denver colorado right now and
I'd like tyrion lannister I like a drink

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,770
and I also know a little bit about
things so talking genda going to briefly

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,930
talk a little bit more about
introduction to rats

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,379
what is a rat's then i'm going to go
into talking about what functionality of

8
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,000
that should have as well as why you want
to write your own and then talk about a

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,480
little bit about security best practices
when it comes to writing rats and then

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,949
my adventure and then lastly a demo
introduction to rats

11
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,718
what is a rabbit essentially a remote
access tool or commonly called a remote

12
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,620
access Trojan essentially is just going
to provide complete control over system

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,310
so some popular artists that are veteran
diameter obviously cool powerful

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,040
powerful Empire Strikes it specifically
the beacon functionality of bullets drag

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,900
others other ones like throwback like
that so if you've never used a computer

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,670
you should will be sure anymore book
beside the point

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,049
ah that's a little bit about it this is
how i really liked that a lot

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,560
and then people start so as far as
necessary red functionality

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,329
these are just the basic there's a lot
of the functionality include much like

20
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,649
screenshots here logging but uh I
haven't had the time to learn those yet

21
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,810
so I so command execution file upload
file download and then in memory

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,090
execution because touching the disc is
bad so far as command execution how you

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,960
can do that so essentially what we want
to do with executing man and safety

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,100
standard effort and or standard air
strings in Python you can do this a

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,640
couple ways you can be a subprocess be
open

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,940
option on c++ they had a safety open and
the YP open function and then a

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,910
powershell in c-sharp you can use the
process blush process class class are at

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,900
which allows you to create processes
within windows whatnot so really nice

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,990
personality as far as file upload so
this is going to be uploading files to

30
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,209
an implanted system first thing we're
going to want to do is probably uploaded

31
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,440
to the web server that way the implant
can access it and then implant is going

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,859
to be picking out determine if it has
any tasks and then it's gonna determine

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,840
that it needs a butt needs to download
and upload file and it will pull it down

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,890
the left server which can be done in a
couple ways you are a little too or the

35
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:55,579
reports library and Python c++ has the
nav I URL downloaded file function and

36
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,769
then I powershell as the the net the
webclient identify function as well as

37
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,570
invoke impressed arm and then obviously
after they closed down that file you can

38
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,720
want to believe that the web server
because having files on the website over

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,579
unnecessarily that bad

40
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:16,370
yeah now i'm going to go onto you file
download specifically downloading a file

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,230
from an implant system so if you want to
pull down some of these see windows boot

42
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,810
that is good i found the best way that I
do this is just the multi-part form-data

43
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,640
post request which allows you to set
boundaries and it also allows you to

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,029
send binary data without having to do
any modification looking around

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,459
so what i do first is I would probably
flip file and then you send the file and

46
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,079
several chunks because nothing is
nothing is talk about early then I'll

47
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,530
sentencing a huge poster like a hundred
makefile depending on if you're having

48
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,940
an archive or not so I would split those
up into probably around one to make

49
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,280
champs and then host those each his
server at specified intervals and then

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,030
reassembles back on the back end and
then once those re-assemble you're gonna

51
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,650
want to that other one was there

52
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,040
that's more like a home directory or
whatnot on as far as in memory execution

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel our
split the vote reflected p injection

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,370
works amazing for DLLs and executables

55
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,668
and then if you want to do like a
powerful process i practiced you and I

56
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:25,490
ex2 expression and then like a webclient
article request so why would you want to

57
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,400
write your own antivirus invasion

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,580
I don't like being caught up by I don't
like Macky right signature myself and

59
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,800
catching me on as that it hasn't
happened but as well as a learning

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,970
experience I learned a lot of different
languages to learn like web growing

61
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,580
languages as well as clients I
programming language throughout this

62
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,090
whole process I mean cost commercial
rights can be expensive

63
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,970
disclaimer that I am very crucial so
expensive for your company is probably

64
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,270
not the same thing is quite expensive vs
me so rest . best practices

65
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,210
first off service I'd I would never
store files and library permanently I

66
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,229
would harden serve exactly how I would
like a web server so I'm going to

67
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:15,020
disable directory indexing vhd access or
skaters like that i'm gonna print

68
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,370
information just glorious era header I
don't want to weak version of apache I'm

69
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,260
running as well as my security what I
mentioned about lastly encrypting all

70
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,219
posts data regardless being sent over
https just because of the fact that the

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:36,770
code has that HTS inches inspection and
yeah as far as rats carries practices

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,590
perfect client side would I don't want
to touch this just because it leads back

73
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,539
it leaves behind forensic artifacts
which sake and forensic investigators

74
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,030
can use against you right signatures for
your app and then less as far as like

75
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,750
never hard-coding credentials so never
our code database potentials or anything

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,690
like that into the implant itself just
because of the fact that somebody

77
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,150
reverse-engineer that and that's gonna
be about that arm as well is Leslie I

78
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,948
beginning of illustrator so what that is
is instead of beating every 10 seconds

79
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,260
you be in 10 seconds maybe 13 seconds
the next time and so on that way no one

80
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,400
is like okay this is where this icy
request every 10 seconds to the specific

81
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,859
PHP PHP page so a little bit about my
adventure initialization interest

82
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,080
I started when I was

83
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,568
doing that we kill trains for popular
retail store yeah they would write

84
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,349
signatures on our rat and I wanted to be
able to customize and change on the fly

85
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:46,780
and without me without very little
downtime so as far as decided that

86
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,210
language was going to everyone's going
to go through that deciding on a quiet

87
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,979
language server doesn't really matter
too much i like to use PHP but uh we I

88
00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:00,729
did I looked into UC sharp C++ Python as
well as powerful c sharp growth

89
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:06,460
obviously it's very easy to code in very
high level language comms tools exist to

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,729
easily disassembled it so I'll spy . he
and then also you need . net framework

91
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,818
be installed on the system this is
usually not an issue within corporate

92
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:24,819
environments but I don't like taking
chances as far as C++ awesome requires

93
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,039
more resources through reverse but and
create a spectacle in sex people also

94
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,810
awesome and pecans it's not as easy at
least for me i'm not really programmer

95
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,469
by nature so I was a little harder for
certain certain things especially when

96
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:46,029
dealing with like ETF and then python
bros super easy to code in pounds you're

97
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,610
gonna require some type of height
interpreter on the system that you're

98
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,169
affecting or gonna require 3rd party
tool which is like the exe can create an

99
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,789
ex-pupil out of that pipe on

100
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,349
alright so this is where I decided I
decided on a powershell suppose memory

101
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:06,250
execution be IEX and web client and
bookrunner across either those and I

102
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,560
haven't seen this yet but I've heard
about it

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,479
how philip XP will be blocked by the
client like a company that's just one

104
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,909
thing to think about

105
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:20,589
alright so evolution of my implant i
originally I started this office

106
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:25,060
approved concept in Python just
determine if i can actually do this and

107
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,449
then eventually migrated bike over and
Python c-sharp d-sharp c++ and then a

108
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,860
couple weeks ago when a linux power
pills announced i quickly started trying

109
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,680
to convert my coat

110
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,679
c++ the power film

111
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,700
alright so this is the rabbit i came up
with a crunchwrap don't ask me how i

112
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,920
came up with that name I don't remember
what is HTS rat it uses self signed by

113
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,170
default but you can easily have this use
a real certificate if you really want to

114
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,060
if you are using the self time to pick
certificate i would highly recommend you

115
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,910
can lock the information because if you
don't it's going to be triggered by

116
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,089
stored on dummy dummy search self-signed
certificates don't get off as a really

117
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,140
silly way to get caught

118
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,120
as far as features right now i have man
execution

119
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,990
I have file download file upload and
then as far as I'm the only one running

120
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,130
this so I haven't had the time to code
in like the ability to take screenshots

121
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:28,070
of key logging process injection things
of that nature database setup so how are

122
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,520
you going to track everything that was
the person that I was trying to figure

123
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,600
out how you attract eating house we're
gonna track tasks and I came on the

124
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,550
solution to just database everything so
i created one rat database that

125
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,000
encompasses everything so the host table
which is going to track everything on

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,230
the beginning click all the beacon exist
on that one . so as well as tasks tasks

127
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,110
everything every cast that has not been
executed at this point and then users so

128
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,820
rat users so there's login portal that
I've created on the web and and that is

129
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,570
what is pouring and an Outlook Outlook
is everything that has been asked at one

130
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:11,779
point and the output like links to
access the output so here's the first

131
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,740
one which is the most stable as you can
see i keep track of things like hosting

132
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,630
the OS architecture how fast it's going
to be getting back to the sea to server

133
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,760
and then certain things like process ID
and process filename for when I actually

134
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,980
eventually start implementing across
this injection on tasks very simple i

135
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,520
have task ID with all talk about the
next slide user who tax who tests that

136
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,899
the hostname for which was passed and
then what the action was what secondary

137
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,450
was again i'm going to talk about ID
action and secondary

138
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,820
here in the next couple minutes so
lastly here's the users just using your

139
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,330
password don't do anything really crazy
with what salting or and I was probably

140
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,780
terrible but not babies I don't want
that but and then the output so Heidi

141
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,680
user hostname action secondary and an
output which is going to paint with

142
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,910
which actually links to like command
output is like that

143
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,730
I'm and status so that's just a simple
yes or now has been executed yet so

144
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,780
tasking over real so i just created
essentially just a series of beacons and

145
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,390
updates so you system begins out doesn't
have anything past ok no begins again

146
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,170
just have to think

147
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,490
yes it does okay and then execute
whatever the task is and then it updates

148
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,040
so task ID is the idea this is just a
numerical control number that is used to

149
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,380
identify the task action is I just shows
like single word so single word action

150
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,520
to describe the task server command
execution i just put a man

151
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,280
download now the file upload upload and
then secondary secondary is going to

152
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,000
support the task action so it was a
command it's going to be like nets that

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,920
and/or Who am I or hostname and then if
it's upload or download is going to be

154
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:06,089
the pot so this is just an example of a
beacon request as you can see every kind

155
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,040
of begins I just I just keep this
information and then based on that

156
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,839
information to determine if something
actually passed so in this case there's

157
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,580
a past one it was

158
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,780
command execute and it's just the next
at $TIME a.m. i use HTML text that

159
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,180
actually worn HTML tags to kind of parse
out the fields to actions ID and

160
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,719
secondary so inflamed configuration I
wanted to him I wanted it is

161
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,700
customizable as possible so c2 IP
address user agent so every time the

162
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,560
beginning updates or begins

163
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,000
that's the user-agent that's going to be
using as far as beacon interval and then

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,380
we can file an update file which please
change those because default there

165
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:55,500
speaking of PHP and updated you to get
home so as far as in memory execution as

166
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,019
i mentioned earlier touching this is bad
just because the front

167
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,249
artifacts left behind by putting the
disk so i ended up just using power show

168
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:07,379
with the idx and then the web client or
you can use the envelope webrequest

169
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,959
function executes memory so this is a
simple command execution bikaner

170
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,339
question though it's the same beacon
that i showed you earlier because

171
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,209
they're also all the beans are always
had the same information and then the

172
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,238
response is executed on my command

173
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,998
um so what it'll do is it'll execute
legal my command and then it will fill

174
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:35,399
out the output parameter like that
output and then the other be updated PHP

175
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,199
function final sorry

176
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:44,969
will our style and say that's a database
as far as a file download so as I

177
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,639
mentioned earlier same beacon request
when it and then there's piles and

178
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:58,589
actually wants to down to download from
the remote system so it's a sweet and

179
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:04,079
then this is where i use the multi-part
Warmack was sorry but for wondered but

180
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,829
essentially just limited i have like an
egg of a and Jarrah burp suite is like

181
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:15,420
12-1 like but I broke it up into like
that's like one big sean anything except

182
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:25,170
obviously again nothing new here with
the beacon request and the response is

183
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,389
the file on the web server that we need
to download and save to a year and

184
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:35,610
pointed system so you can see there the
x3 s390x see that I need to save from

185
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,429
the web server onto the implanted system
and that's just an example update was

186
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:45,089
after it's already downloaded so it'll
download and then it'll send requesting

187
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,169
ok cool i downloaded it is updated
update the status let them know that

188
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:57,569
it's on the system out and kind of went
a little bit fast as far as demo I'm

189
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:03,089
going to split the environment which so
i have a Windows 10 system which is the

190
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,929
. 144 this is assistant we're going to
plant and then use a

191
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:29,839
c2 server which is a debian it's at 140
address so I don't do that um so this is

192
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,270
just the name login page default
credentials are admin changement admin

193
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:43,579
change me so I'm just going to login and
i'm here at the home screen this is

194
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,750
where i am planning to implement a chat
window where every different user every

195
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,760
rat user can communicate like just
coordinate activities haven't gotten

196
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,870
there yet

197
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,399
post as you see right now I talked about
its tracking everything that I talked

198
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,610
about there's no implant systems right
now so that's one of you Alton output

199
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:14,540
tab that is ok um hood that is going to
be where everything that's going to be

200
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,510
pretty much your granddaughter you're
gonna see everything that's been that

201
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:25,130
task the output of that said task
manager and then generate a low so this

202
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,850
is going to generate a powershell
one-niner I haven't implemented base-10

203
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,459
basics for encoding on sorry but we will
do is you specify the IP address that

204
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:43,279
you want call back to as well as the
implant filing our this is just going

205
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:51,050
for a little bit of functionality as far
as look at users chain has word so we're

206
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:57,020
actually going to generate a load now so
there's a servant 140 and then I o'clock

207
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,230
my implant I'll md is one so just let me
know that it's so like i said i was

208
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,329
going to change that harsh old man will
be a 64 encoded here soon and I just to

209
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,569
get around to it so case i will likely
to paste that in there

210
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,300
excuse you can see that our shell is the
process running you don't see it but

211
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,810
and then i go over those tabs i see that
i have this was beginning back so I'm

212
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:32,000
going to ask commands and then you can
test look manzoor the same systems just

213
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:44,630
like that only going systems in there
and that's a lot man i'm just gonna hang

214
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,120
I do it because it was an innovator and
access the point just being that 1111

215
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,160
so here's the output tab as you can see
two commands already executed indicated

216
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,100
by the output hyperlink as well as the
executed is now oh yes so I just refresh

217
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:13,070
this and eventually that that I could
get that as far as saying alba just

218
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:19,879
click the link which will just print a
page and yeah only thing i can think

219
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,550
about right now is a mice might my
sequel has a limitation of 6535

220
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:30,620
characters have to keep that in mind I
have like a narrow tracks but just keep

221
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,250
that in mind when you're executing
commands as far as here is here i am

222
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,980
just telling you pretty much anger
password soon as you log in initially so

223
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,910
that's the demo on I want three quickly
i want to leave enough time for

224
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,170
questions so does anyone have any
questions or whatnot actually starts

225
00:18:48,170 --> 00:19:04,640
I'll i have thanks like okay so thanks
people i work with are really smart

226
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,360
I'm as well as people don't work are
really smart specifically powerful

227
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:15,740
Empire arm joannec ma wrapping our
coolest ride even fewer came up with

228
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,680
reflective DLL research job i like and
then a greater who like leaves here so

229
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:29,510
that's oh yeah here is my contact
information on twitter i don't really

230
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,549
post that much

231
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:35,269
keep in mind though my master branch is
out-of-date i still need to update that

232
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:41,269
from the death so don't pull it down
right now but yeah that's that's my own

233
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:57,950
as is there any questions or yet I
haven't even done that when i was doing

234
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,409
c++ i was calling a lot of like the one
API stuff but then I got it I got a

235
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,320
little frustrated not frustrated but i
just kinda I was like this it's so much

236
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:33,950
easier to do in powershell anything I
has like I don't want to register your

237
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:50,779
own server and also sadly this is
serious

238
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:56,059
major you can actually told to ignore
any cell cycle and error so they also

239
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:02,600
use put it ignore those areas so just I
think you want to know

240
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:19,399
actually one get it right now is not i
can actually get fully implemented put

241
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:24,619
it it shouldn't be that hard and take
the beacon arable either summer

242
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:28,668
yeah you like a random between maybe
like . 75 and one and then add that

243
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,600
number 22 the beginning to the interval
sorry

244
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,039
any more any more questions

245
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,720
cool thanks everybody I
