1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
good talks and besides it doesn't you'll
have fun

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,900
you didn't lose your niece or you know
last hour i heard that was absolutely

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,850
packed it was not as crowded in here for
the for the community talk

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,650
these have been it's really been a good
day so thank you everyone for coming out

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,570
they really appreciate I really gonna
have a little bit of fun of announcing

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:35,399
these texts so when they submit our
equal right beside us that we did RCMP

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,010
like quite a while ago and the Lord us
all working together we will work

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,640
roughly around the same Park line and
many of our ID and at that point it was

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,489
you know pretty cool we're putting this
off and was always something on four or

10
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,140
five of us and we all for now reporting
companies but Jackie silver is and i

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:12,450
made guys your game will survive anyway
active tiny belongings were also know

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,710
what we call her and then we got also
seen season is now an Oracle and rocky

13
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,020
who is a community as well start to
think of America two days from now

14
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,158
they're lucky

15
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:36,329
so really good 20 out that so i give you
these three guys to talk about money you

16
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,389
should be cool

17
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,990
hi everybody as he said I'm Jackie sets
of possible consultant of immediate been

18
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,939
with me for about three years . i spent
most of my life and hi dusty dangerous

19
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,820
places to it's tough for the defense
department steep outstanding cup with

20
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,279
oracle now I've done the pedal range of
blue team stuff soxer running and

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,038
building a involved enough doing an
incident response of second offs you

22
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,690
know .

23
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,980
firewalls and stuff like that crazy
ideas for that tragically bankamerica

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:26,869
monday morning so amazing to work with
as little immediate I teams so GE

25
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:37,940
Capital they're also doing well with a
general-purpose Slattery so is to water

26
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,990
and use anything that's a record

27
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:55,670
super zero gravity here if you got to
catch it with oj out alright so we talk

28
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,809
about hunting or actually let's back up
a little bit we talked about security

29
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,560
operations and we talk about the problem
set the hunting could potentially solve

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,880
right we're looking at finding evil
we're looking at ways for evil to do

31
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,140
evil things which are risky potentially
stupid things that are happening in the

32
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,299
environment things your users are doing
way systems and our configure the way

33
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,070
the architecture is laid out that create
wider attack surfaces that you would

34
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,730
really want and we want to use the data
that we already have data that we could

35
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,269
get and the intent is to make things
better

36
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,800
alright want to improve things it's not
just hey guys we have a lot of bad

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,220
things and we have a lot of incidents as
a result want to feed this information

38
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,940
back into security operations and
improve the security program overall so

39
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,329
that's what we're here today to talk to
you about our solutions that right honey

40
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:54,739
ideas in the end and a threat hunting is
is really using the data we have to to

41
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,640
look for ways that we can improve our
posture whether that's kicking bad guys

42
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,040
out or preventing them from getting in
through different means and we want to

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,630
use use what we find as Jackie mention
to bring it back into the sox that we

44
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,510
can continue to improve both on the sock
and as the security programs at all

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:27,080
yeah so i'm doing here is hunting is is
your tools

46
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:35,419
Lily fallout able to translate your
knowledge and you're thinking too cool

47
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,770
that you might have trouble so it is not
tools

48
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:48,859
here's their party is back here with a
renter and the jacket we are pulling off

49
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,140
a Soyuz what works for you

50
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,050
I know what you're gonna learn a
vegetarian right so into contact with

51
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:09,020
the general is actively going out there
and find ways for three days and the

52
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,599
endgame is the end up looking right so
if you're going to try to find you

53
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:21,349
you don't have to do it needs to be our
nation but it's it's not having machine

54
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:29,390
humming it is about human is not using
your experiences to have people to talk

55
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,620
about building a guess i should use the
Michael we talked about building program

56
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,050
and there are different foundational
aspects of the harp program or of a

57
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,020
security program that you need to look
at before you start thinking about

58
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,979
building a hot program on top of that
right so the very first thing that we're

59
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,190
looking at here is a formalized security
program right somebody cares about

60
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,520
security within your organization
someone is providing some executive

61
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,060
sponsorship there you have some type of
budget some type of resources available

62
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,350
to tackle this problem within the
organization most of you here hopefully

63
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,950
have this in place the next thing we
want to talk about is a functioning

64
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,860
security operations capability and
functioning instead of response

65
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,550
capability right you've got to be able
to you gotta be able to handle the

66
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,210
incidents that you have they're coming
in you've got to be able to detect these

67
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,719
incidents you've got to be able to feed
those back into security operations and

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,310
kind of IT across the enterprise to
reiterate that information and make it

69
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,340
useful to the rest of the organization
to drive risk down that's what we're

70
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,289
trying to do here is dr risk down

71
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,649
and your daddy mentioned technology and
tools but the way we look at it man

72
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:40,279
anyways kind of tractor right tools
technology process and people write

73
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,749
these are three distinct things that
come together join together to build a

74
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:49,460
functioning security program so tools
and technology you need to have them but

75
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,669
they're not the end-all be-all and
they're based on the people and the

76
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:58,279
processes that you have right and music
cases the playbooks lot of people don't

77
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,289
have these this is getting up into the
detection maturity right see that arrow

78
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,469
trending upward there must be this tall
to ride right you've got to have a

79
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,709
security program going to have security
operations capability instant response

80
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,559
capability you've got to have the
technology and tools that support those

81
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:17,360
functions and once you start thinking
about how to make sure your processes

82
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,699
you start working on detection use cases
and response playbooks how do you detect

83
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,469
the problems the issues the risks the
vulnerabilities

84
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:33,740
how do you how do you bring in the data
sources that are required to make these

85
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,889
detection and how do you respond to
these in a methodical manner that

86
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:45,050
incorporates every business unit or
individual within your organization that

87
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,649
has some kind of relationship to the
incident response process at the very

88
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:51,919
top of this pyramid we're looking at a
hot program i said a lot of things that

89
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,258
need to be in place hopefully optimally
for you to begin hunting now if you have

90
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:01,669
analyst bench time and you want to start
hunting for fun in your spare time

91
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,959
that's a great way to start dipping your
toes in and getting some experience

92
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,839
they're getting some exposure settings
so blue

93
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:22,879
who's heard or read very very good with
your hands high of these were eliminated

94
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,580
squirrels are going to use the lives of

95
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:35,598
go to school oh we stand on the
shoulders of giants standing always so a

96
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,169
lot because I can get mired in words
let's give you kind of an overall idea

97
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,930
it's pretty right

98
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,649
all-purpose unable to do for a lot of
times that working out so you can do

99
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:57,529
straight this you know favor of this
scale levels 04 of what kind of

100
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:02,390
renovations are which level that might
be ready for a combined federal level 0

101
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,819
your training part right

102
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,880
no IDs to your base

103
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:15,050
ok start but not really care do any kind
of immature wanting a little one which

104
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:23,300
is minimal on now you're going to get
here soon i'll call you maybe start

105
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,160
actually collecting some of our dad was
as soon as we reported after the pumpkin

106
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,279
levels of 23 now you're going to create
processes procedures you're not worried

107
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:40,250
about your old as much really good and
then your data collection way all we

108
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,440
have total war which is your kind of
leading the charge and there's not only

109
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,120
homies that are really at that level of
maturity like they're the ones everybody

110
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,690
else i'm talking to some of the guys for
a while one of the examples is the g sir

111
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,949
has been doing this for a very long time
you meet anybody

112
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:12,949
Jesus or pick their brains so this is
kind of all right cool so now we want to

113
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:15,500
do this right so how we going to build
this right basically we're gonna go back

114
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,190
through that pyramid first thing
executive sponsorships your management

115
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,829
needs know what you're doing what you're
going to find what it means when you

116
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,979
find it because they want to know they
want a heads up that you're going to

117
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,180
find something bet and you're going to
tell them about it and they may have to

118
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,069
take that public for compliance reasons
for

119
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,520
pii you know disclosure reasons what
have you so they need to know you're

120
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,020
doing and support you

121
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,970
next you need to have a login shred you
need to have those logs coming into the

122
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,280
right spot to be normalized artists do
all that stuff right it's very important

123
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,339
that you're getting stuff to the right
place so that you can actually use it

124
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,710
right so insane bo2 said rice authorize
it take it in one place that you can

125
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,370
actually start digging through the data
if it's all over the place you're gonna

126
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:06,360
have a bad time make it available within
one spot make it searchable right it is

127
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,740
just a syslog server sitting on disk and
all you gotta scrub again you're gonna

128
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,490
have a bad time you guys able to do
something more powerful than that

129
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,260
faster than that and then lastly you
gotta drive maturity right you've got

130
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,780
some stuff got tools you can search you
can hunt but 92 start documenting to

131
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,800
start making these use cases start
taking these hunts feeding them off to

132
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,949
becoming alerts through automation so
developers cases right

133
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,310
check your date are you getting the
right stuff you have a long need to find

134
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,030
what you think you should be able to
find if you're trying to look for for

135
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,270
suspicious domains and you're not
getting enough traffic right there is a

136
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:53,010
great spot you need to get your dns laws
your tooling associated apartments you

137
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,100
know you're going to get you're gonna
start going to go full security onion

138
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,790
here we go

139
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,170
I got it on an endpoint security and got
another one well okay kids working great

140
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,839
for us while we've expanded our team of
you know 15 people security working for

141
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,250
us anymore i don't know it might be you
might need tuning my native tool you

142
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,300
might need some more enterprise-level
you know not as much of the kind of open

143
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,380
source but it's going to depend on you
your program your team what you're

144
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,410
comfortable with what your capabilities
are and then lastly hard-won again it's

145
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,400
very important

146
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,930
what you find is to go back into the
rest of your program if you find you

147
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:38,400
know malicious actors how they get in
how you prevent getting again if you if

148
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,689
you find someone doing something silly
that they should be doing that

149
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,290
you know how can you stop that from
happening in the future how can you

150
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:53,400
haven't implemented a policy education
of you know how can you improve your

151
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:02,579
overall organization again this is
another good good illustration of the

152
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:10,800
overview of what your little machine so
a lot of articles i'll write and depend

153
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,439
on what you're doing you can just eat
your life group and never talk to other

154
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,890
departments that sucks and it's never
going to get anywhere just going to

155
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,900
illustrate about what that angle is
going from your on your conditions feed

156
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,730
that into your IRA so it might have
enough already but if you find something

157
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:38,460
to get on is important it'll fill that
role of course that out the IR output

158
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:45,060
effects second-straight that affects
your saw you guys last night they have

159
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,839
to answer your letters from IRS them and
then it really is all about lessons

160
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,740
learned

161
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,410
I don't nobody want to do it was able to
read but it's super important and you

162
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,329
don't want to have to make twice so
lesson learned after actually worth

163
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:10,620
trooper important and then build that
back into your your overall bill great

164
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,230
so you can go back and find yourself but
that all those have to feed into each

165
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:23,070
other so there are a couple arrows here
thank you down a couple arrows here

166
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,890
right yeah you've all evil and not evil
right so that we can get into this and a

167
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:34,230
little bit there are two ways to to look
at the hunt output right evil and ways

168
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,400
for evil to do evil things so things
that negatively affects our security

169
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,780
posture and at widener attack surface so
when we talk about the output of the

170
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,680
Hunts becomes evil we passed the
incident response right these are guys

171
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,310
that need to handle the issues
realization i go through that process a

172
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,219
non-evil risk something that is just
stupid or

173
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,310
risky needs to go into security
operations that can handle that

174
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,050
vulnerability in the in the way that
makes sense for the organization and so

175
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,019
on that note right there's three things
are going to find on you're gonna find

176
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,399
nothing that's not that right if you
phrase your hunt correctly and you have

177
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,670
the right classes you don't find
anything that means that whatever you

178
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,849
are looking for is not there right that
that's a good thing

179
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,689
now eventually you may need to review
this because you might have their own

180
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,969
right that might not have the right data
or maybe it's not relevant to you your

181
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,540
environment right if you have no sequel
in your environment and looking for

182
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,709
single injection you just not going to
find it right it's not relevant to what

183
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,579
you go you're gonna find non-malicious
the stupid the ways for able to do evil

184
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,930
things right this is good right you can
take this you can apply new policies and

185
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,620
procedures in order to mitigate that
risk or you're going to find delicious

186
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,759
stuff you can see that your team that
can remediate it find those lessons

187
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,910
learned bringing back in again happening
again

188
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,779
excellent so we talk about sorting out
data we talk about data sources data

189
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,959
sources are critical to the task of
hunting you don't have the right data

190
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,719
you might as well not hunt so this is a
kind of a set of examples of different

191
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,829
types of data that we can integrate to
our hot missions and you'll notice a

192
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,239
life pretty typical traditional things i
wanted to VPN connections and want to

193
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,470
monitor dns and one monitor threat
intelligence whether that comes from

194
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,870
inside the organization or was developed
internally internally or externally

195
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,100
right you can have information feed-in
for multiple places from outside the

196
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,079
organization they're going to be really
useful the the place where I don't see

197
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,469
organizations focusing from a threat
Intel perspective is within the

198
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,610
organization right there are people
performing reconnaissance against your

199
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,360
enterprise

200
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,459
this is useful information there are
people talking about you on IRC that's

201
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,939
useful information write your
organization is targeted it behooves you

202
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:54,689
to understand how you're being targeted
and what the objectives of these

203
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:58,620
tractors are what their motivations are
and how you can integrate that

204
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,470
information into your heart operations

205
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,230
same goes for HR information we don't
see this a lot

206
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,839
guy gets fire guy or gal gets fired
right now they may have shared their

207
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,708
credentials of someone else they may be
coming back into the network to steal

208
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,260
some intellectual property get some
stuff off of their machine or whatever

209
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,069
the case maybe if if you're not tied
into the HR termination workflow from

210
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:25,199
Assad perspective you may not know about
this you may not be able to detect this

211
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,209
very well so there are a lot of
different sources of information that

212
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,320
you can use to generate some really
useful detection zand you want to think

213
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,049
very broadly about this information and
how it can work for you in your

214
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:38,910
environment want to talk about events
there are two types of events there are

215
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,929
observed events these are events that
came directly from a system that process

216
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,190
the data that you want to look at all
right have a router that passed a

217
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,840
connection right generate a log that is
a observable events observed event came

218
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,699
directly from the source you have things
like synthetic events these were

219
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,320
generated through some type of analytic
process that was automated if you have a

220
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,439
let's say you have a sandbox that your
address . your sandbox popular and said

221
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,510
hey we analyze this data and there's
something that you should look at you

222
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,070
can look at it as an alert look as as a
synthetic event and frankly guys there

223
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,270
isn't any kind of standardization across
the industry right now for a lot of

224
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,540
these hot terms and so these are
suggestions for how to look at these

225
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,879
some folks in the back over here would
say that an event is an alert is not a

226
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,669
synthetic event but it could be looked
at that way depending on what the

227
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:40,500
sources what you're seeing here on the
screen on

228
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,100
that's an Apache log right that log on
the very top and these screenshots from

229
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,100
the Firecracker analytics platform any
of you ever heard of it

230
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,730
excellent platform want product but it
is really cool guys I probably

231
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,060
i should say that because it is true or
not probably not going to be important

232
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,100
up here I you see the circle right
Patrick server that a lot of originated

233
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:12,429
from the server that process that client
connection and so that that came from

234
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,410
the server and so it's an observed event
that sentiment down here this is an

235
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,990
analytic log an analytic events in that
basically stating that the ratio of

236
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,830
Santa to receive their particular set of
events i didn't see right so it's a

237
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:35,620
maybe some kind of filtration hurting
here is always something that I heard

238
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,040
about so that's a synthetic event that's
what we mean here's want to do some

239
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,920
definition of terms so that we can
understand we're talking about here

240
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,060
so how we have a prologue up here on the
screen if you don't know grown our

241
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,840
security monitor you gotta notes a great
great open source tool we want to use

242
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,389
original source data whenever possible

243
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,840
right just like we said and observed
event something that came directly from

244
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,970
the system that processed that that data
so this is metadata coming from the

245
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,140
system that process the original data we
want to make sure that the right fielder

246
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,340
there so you see all these fields are
split outright the the client variables

247
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:18,189
actually a lot of different dinosaurs is
not specific to the android platform but

248
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:24,010
any other pivot points here are the
standard pivot points right you can be

249
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:31,300
perspective you know is for a particular
section or connection and you're gonna

250
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,409
want to potentially stack those and see
whether maybe you happen to have a high

251
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,790
incidence of fluorophores right maybe
someones trying to do something

252
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,420
squirrely and they're triggering a bunch
of fluorophores that's useful

253
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,050
information but you wouldn't know unless
you are able to pick that piece of

254
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,530
information out of the event right and
use it as you see fit

255
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,580
observed events are better than
synthetic events unless you're using

256
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,689
synthetic events for contacts I said
that events are great for contacts when

257
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,570
you use a hot platform you have varying
capabilities in terms of enrichment you

258
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,320
may be able to tag event you may be able
to tag a set of ip's you may be able to

259
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,299
add contacts to specific events I mean
it really berries in terms of the

260
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:20,629
technology and tools that are out there
but the the point is is you generally

261
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,330
want to rely on the information that
came directly from the source close to

262
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,090
the source as possible from from a data
perspective again you've got to be able

263
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,620
to pick those extract those extractable
data points out that that makes sense

264
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:46,428
for you and that are important for you
ready two spells so the walls

265
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,990
sure yeah so there's really three main
points that on your arm your videos on

266
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:02,840
your organization even as we have one
way is is underpinning our you have to

267
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:13,129
really focus your energies I I'll not so
much and that is not a little craft

268
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:22,250
place you have to recognize your glasses
and also think think more problem only

269
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:28,580
domestically attractive about how what
you're going to do benefit you know I

270
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,590
our minds not it

271
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,189
the tutoring words or operations and
also you're going to find you know you

272
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,250
might find

273
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:45,690
parking parking issues due to get that
you really have to figure this out we

274
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:54,420
can cripple not so those are always two
and two original sexual orgasm is all

275
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,990
about

276
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:01,440
I never want to see somebody told me hey
I found this area right here call my

277
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,410
wife in black and white because noses
are you going

278
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:18,870
I had a realization they had a healthy
and he said block everything a ok y ok

279
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:29,159
so no oh so this is that's kind of how
you so then the right you talk about

280
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,510
contact right we want to reach this
state we wanted your wrist is coming in

281
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,320
right maybe we can tag this we know we
had asset management we know what our

282
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,540
star database the resort what our web
servers are do we have a set of feeds

283
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,040
right and healthy so they coming

284
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,210
you know external internal things that
we're building or that we paid for this

285
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,600
pathetically it's something every out
you know whatever information we have

286
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,990
that we can feed in this system right
can we figure out where these VIPs are

287
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,090
right somebody talking to an IP in
california and in kuwait this might be

288
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,840
interesting it may not be or you know
maybe they're coming from California and

289
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,300
maybe more interesting putting context
to this information is coming in allows

290
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,649
you to make additional decisions and
having it there in your platform is very

291
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,390
very helpful to be able especially to
say you know I've got this guy is

292
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,600
hitting this time he turns over and over
and over again instead having to go on

293
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,620
yourself and say who is IP address if it
already will tell you you know with some

294
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,820
level of confidence

295
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,510
what the who is report is that p that's
really really helpful to know

296
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,800
immediately

297
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,639
oh it's you know Claire site for amazon
and it's just refreshing the page is not

298
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,830
a big deal

299
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:48,629
so tools right we talked a lot about
data we mentioned tools tools next right

300
00:24:48,630 --> 00:25:09,299
mind Danny just go ahead and do so and
so what are we to our minds this is

301
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,168
private

302
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:17,460
the three most important things you want
to research anybody know you're probably

303
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,399
right

304
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:25,918
you know sometimes you have higher
compression also be running hang on how

305
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:33,269
could they started functioning father's
not so ideally rewrappers comeback is

306
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:42,000
amazing we got spoiled because the
surgery went very cozy but trouble so

307
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,070
I'm stacking which is really just happen
right you want to say i want to see what

308
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:54,480
this thing did how many times as big
with everything being able to do that so

309
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,010
it's not enough just to have possible
all i want to hold that have fireballs

310
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,760
into that ideally any point along you
know

311
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:13,510
ok once ideas so you can form a larger
picture and he seems that earlier

312
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,200
nothing still something right it don't
find something

313
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:26,290
this is exactly why hunting is important
so then as you're sure be able to

314
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:33,820
integrate tell me stuff we're already
talking about that time so this is

315
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:41,020
beautiful keys are really building
functioning he's reading his moves do so

316
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:46,090
obviously tools tools cost money baby
right there's a lot of good open source

317
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,560
stuff out there you gotta you gotta
drive these by operational requirements

318
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,429
which was i mentioned before one you and
your team need because it's going to be

319
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,700
different for every organization you
have different stuff coming in you have

320
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,690
different needs different departments
and so it's very important that when you

321
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,200
go through a selection process for your
tool whether it's something you're

322
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,560
paying more from a vendor where you're
doing an open source with a you know

323
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,530
elasticsearch Elsa or or you know
whatever the case may be that then you

324
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,540
taking into account what you actually
need what's gonna work for you so we put

325
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,530
a list here this is absolutely not
all-inclusive there's some great stuff

326
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:29,230
out there that's open source is free it
will scale very well you just need to

327
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,990
design it and work with it correctly and
so that's something to take into account

328
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,350
when you are when you're doing this
going to this process

329
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:41,500
alright we can talk about analysis we
talk about the threat hunting loop this

330
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,600
is another wonderful graphic from the
team over a squirrel David bianco he's

331
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,139
gonna hate me for this because that
later the hunting space he used to work

332
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,010
over on with us and maybe it on the
three analytics platform team and job

333
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,550
came up with a lot of really good stuff
with us and then took long that went

334
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,379
over to squirrel stole it

335
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,590
just kidding so we start with hypotheses
right things that we assume about our

336
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:12,189
environment right for example we have a
policy to not plug USB drives into

337
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,809
critical service how do we bear that out

338
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,830
how do we make sure that we are actually
plug in USB drives into critical servers

339
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,289
right we form a hypothesis and we seek
to prove that either wrong or right once

340
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:29,210
we develop these hypotheses whether
they're very broad broadly scoped or

341
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,570
more narrowly scopes which you'll you'll
end up

342
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,019
trending that way over time you'll start
with these really broad hypotheses and

343
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,690
then start narrowing the bad we'll talk
about what those look like here in a

344
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,440
minute

345
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,340
start investigating using your tools you
start developing new automations for

346
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,740
these and then you work goes back into
the to your platform to your hunt

347
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,929
methodology to security operations
overall this is a wall of text we are

348
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:58,190
not going to go over all of this this is
for you to take home will put up the

349
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,679
slides after we get done here today and
hopefully you'll be able to get some

350
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,330
ideas from this list that will help you
develop a base set of hypotheses about

351
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,658
your environment and start thinking
about what data sources you need to

352
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:15,980
bring in to detect those and what tools
you can use to detect investigate those

353
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:21,619
so 10 mafia this is kinda way as how
when i first started doing hunting i

354
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:26,480
like to phrase the question do I see
suspicious outbound data transfers all

355
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,129
right that's a good way to think about

356
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:31,820
I like I've changed a little bit and I
think this is mostly a luxury stuff but

357
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,080
beyond those I like to praise Him as a
statement and i want to say the

358
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,470
statement is we're doing something right
right

359
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,600
we don't plug USB keys into critical
servers we you know pick one of these

360
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,279
off the list right we don't have inbound
traffic from our DMZ to our internal

361
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,330
network and I want to prove ideal I want
to prove it right right i don't want to

362
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,590
find that stuff

363
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,879
chances are probably going to prove that
wrong but i want to start with a

364
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:01,580
statement of I'm gonna find that we're
doing this right

365
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,059
we're making the right decisions were
doing the right things so that's some

366
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:09,740
way that's how i started to freeze those
kind of to you but you want to make it a

367
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:19,549
note on it so stubby and so now we're
gonna talk a bit about a lot of stuff

368
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,279
that we found doing this at edible
different country different companies

369
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:30,619
and you wanna kind of introducing sure
yeah so you're already ways for you

370
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:39,619
you'll only should call my heart is with
this model and all should hire people

371
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:45,889
say about you you're worried about it
you know the exact knowledge is in a

372
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:54,199
more engineering and this is there you
see this all the time already is ok i

373
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,409
smoke and accidents this actually do
some stories that we have during our

374
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:07,730
expeditions of so one of the biggest
this is daddy's right shooting hand it

375
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:13,190
over with management we want to apply
time and said hey look at all jobless

376
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,649
told you II building firebox a little
straight A's

377
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:21,649
I don't business to run

378
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,860
also he kind of said it like that was
very he was very like emotional about it

379
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,850
you know we're showing him like you know
firefox going back to like version one

380
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,269
across the whole business like just
totally crazy steps like flash java

381
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:41,090
firefox super older explore for like you
know 10 15 years ago realized how could

382
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,080
this be this is like a humongous company
was all heard of them and they're

383
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,399
supposed to be doing the right thing and
working relations that you're going to

384
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:54,860
have reviewed negative real know you
have to earn it

385
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,309
it's awesome that the guests drama on
how did you people later across the

386
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,960
entire enterprise that shit so you have
to really try and talk to them with

387
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,330
slide so each of these examples we're
gonna get this is all stuff we found

388
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,199
real-life environments different
companies whether it be our own others

389
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,309
consulted with what have you up they're
gonna have a couple different pieces are

390
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:24,139
gonna have my boxes price think raising
what we found and then we put some

391
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,120
remediation something there that's kind
of more you know reading home but wanted

392
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,500
to try to have an opportunity to put
some information there about you know

393
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,010
how we would recommend no fixing some of
these things right just as a to try and

394
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,100
give some more information that
everybody can take almond and learn from

395
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,629
so good

396
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:52,970
sure so this is one of the casuals that
will always be yours 003 essence of it

397
00:32:52,970 --> 00:33:03,799
process technology application for the
indicators going on down a little and

398
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,929
the NBA games you'll sit down through
the years of experience

399
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:17,660
thank you so much cool stuff for rtb
ruin access always always so hypothesis

400
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:24,770
is as Tina said earlier all of our
Harbor and access is using improving and

401
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:31,280
that's being an optimist so we can be
anything from your flying DNC to the

402
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,918
production Network which is awesome

403
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,570
RTP domain controllers from the beauty
that is no longer being gotomypc at it

404
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,740
again and then from there you have too
little

405
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,580
condition so you don't have to you have
to go to the regulations because we're

406
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,909
gonna be short on time but you'll notice
here guys that we didn't put a

407
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,690
disposition in here right in terms of
like evil or away for able to do an evil

408
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,480
thing right you guys know your
environment you guys know what's

409
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,600
acceptable in your environment you guys
know what the risk profile hopefully

410
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,428
more or less of your organization what
it looks like it so you know what you

411
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:09,580
can risk except you know what you said
the cameras accepted you know why

412
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,819
enclaves are more important than others
what Dad is more important than other

413
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,350
and what users are more important than
others and so you'll you'll want to make

414
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,889
your own determinations of course as to
what the disposition is on these but we

415
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:27,490
left it pretty vague on these slides
data storage so the hypothesis is that

416
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:33,100
were only storing data in places where
it should live i see smiles we got to

417
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,239
get this done yeah yeah it's pretty
crazy right but this is a very broad

418
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,350
hypothesis again where works we're
having a very broad start . and then we

419
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:47,020
started to follow those in a couple more
detailed thoughts about specific

420
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,850
protections that we can enact in our
environment so some of the things that

421
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,679
we found we found a really sensitive
corporate data on USB sticks that were

422
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,800
affected so users coming over to the
machine

423
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,790
he's plugging it in mcafee is blocking
that we don't care because it got

424
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,000
blocked so nobody's looking at that
event and they're sensitive data on

425
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,380
there and it comes back the next day he
plugs it in again and mcafee blocks it

426
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,560
again and it's like the same thing over
and over again no one cares about this

427
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,980
because mcafee said it was blocked

428
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,770
well now the guy goes over to another
machine that somebody filled with salt

429
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,200
avion and now you have a problem right

430
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,000
you gotta pay attention to stuff like
that cloud providers right if you just

431
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,650
run a list of the top ten or twenty
cloud providers on the internet and run

432
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,420
that through your proxy data or just
straight networked out you're gonna be

433
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,320
really upset

434
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,680
there are a lot of people uploading a
lot of weird stuff that you can't quite

435
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,490
identify two places where you don't want
it and to organizations that you don't

436
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,080
have an SLA with and code repositories
and something that we see a lot of

437
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,779
developers they kind of operate with our
mentality they need to do things the way

438
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,150
that they want to do them and they store
data were they

439
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,809
want to start so we do end up finding
that a lot and that is a risky

440
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:05,650
proposition for an organization that
depends on intellectual property to

441
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,339
survive

442
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:12,609
alright proxy nurture hypotheses are
proxies are configured correctly right

443
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:16,450
get very broad you will narrow this down
right is because only much more

444
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,259
interesting is going to be our proxy
don't allow categorize malicious traffic

445
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,710
right but it's probably a little bit
more narrowly scope probably a little

446
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,480
more realistic but all the same light
right had a client went to him and said

447
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,569
why are you allowing all this delicious
no malicious traffic

448
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,730
what do you mean we paid millions of
dollars for you know software unifier

449
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,210
well then directs and supposed to be
locking and and doing gateway antivirus

450
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,099
I you might wanna go check them out
because i can tell you they're not right

451
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,210
this is being allowed you know that was
one nice thing about in this case

452
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,140
putting putting a different sensor and
maybe put Rowan because their firewall

453
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,520
logs came back and said you know set
alert but they just took that mean well

454
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,420
it was blocked

455
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,200
either that or they weren't looking at
which is more likely a free easy way of

456
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,919
identify something like that your poxy
lives just to look at the ratio of like

457
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,180
denied to allows yeah that was
originally found it is is it was like

458
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:15,430
one percent chance there 1% denied
traffic have a firewall you know about a

459
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:20,680
web filter like that's not gonna happen
in a user environment ever there like we

460
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,460
brought a consultant from that company
from that finger to help us implement

461
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,099
this and they spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on proxy

462
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,329
infrastructure that was wasted for a
full 12 months as money that could have

463
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:36,730
gone back into the security program
right so some other things right not

464
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:42,819
blocking defecation weathers executables
or or you know whatever the policy says

465
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:48,038
or maybe the things we've got is not
long enough information right there's

466
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:53,230
one big major firewall vendor that
doesn't login user agent string on HTTP

467
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,809
traffic right user is incredibly
important to identify and malicious

468
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:04,990
activity in HTTP traffic but it doesn't
login . does not log it i have several

469
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,379
buses that many times and sorry i don't
have good news report

470
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:15,470
ok go back and so that last one there
that last discovery bullet the proxies

471
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,980
not logging the necessary metadata this
is important not just from a hot

472
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,850
perspective but from a forensics
perspective if you have to investigate

473
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,779
an incident six months later and it was
something really bad and you really need

474
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,200
to know what happened if you're not
loving the right-field you might as well

475
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,189
not even log and save data because it's
going to be useless to you when it comes

476
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:42,200
down to the to the critical times so I
make that point all over all your

477
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:56,270
reviews you so whatever we found tell
him every be playing test is present

478
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:04,580
across to you know it's going to be do i
RZ yes only one degree still happening

479
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,140
and it's gonna be something innocuous
and just kind of here being consulted

480
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,379
you always get old building we don't
know overall process that s is urs he

481
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:24,950
didn't work why you can just be so
security her regular games of SC or they

482
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:31,129
can be received generally interactive
2013 boss talking to each other so

483
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:38,660
that's kind of risky tour guess you all
the time is movie download games movies

484
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:48,980
downloaded you know as not happen and so
yeah that's one of the reasons prove

485
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,800
clients right internet access achieve
knowing using no good software right

486
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,430
this is a question of patch management
probably seems suspicious stuff that

487
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,839
you're like this is related to know
browser or you know or anything like

488
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,950
that I've ever heard of or seen as we
mentioned before you're going back

489
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,629
firefox versions you know 10 years old
at that you should have no place on

490
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,790
enterprise network and sometimes it's
tough on guest wireless and you kind of

491
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:20,620
kind of hung up stuck but a lot of times
it will be but hunting you know it's a

492
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,009
good way you're gonna find this novel is
stuff but it's a good way to validate

493
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,750
other things right you you now validated
hey patch management may not be working

494
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,650
as well maybe we thought it was alright
and so it's a good way and feedback into

495
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,300
the program to improve that take back to
your your ops teams to say hey look at

496
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,570
that we're patching firefox you know
everyone should be up to you know

497
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:48,100
whatever 35 or whatever the latest one
is that is an outside of the traditional

498
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:54,549
autocycle right which I always come back
with the check in the Box magic magic

499
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,920
exactly those boxes always get checked i
don't know how through them so a

500
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,510
privilege management i put usernames up
here but should probably agreed accounts

501
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:09,610
are you want to make sure that our
accounts are stored in the right way are

502
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,560
standardized the right way that there's
a taxonomy that makes sense for

503
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,860
organizations that we can pick out the
things that don't make sense right if

504
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,700
everyone in your organization is first
initial last name for the user accounts

505
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,189
and you see like you know I don't know
give me an example

506
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:32,350
elite guy 56 like you know that's not a
legitimate user name right there

507
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,930
they're different implications here
right when you start noticing usernames

508
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,690
are coming outside inspector a lot of
different locations right you have

509
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:43,030
service accounts that are shared by
different users or used by non automated

510
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,360
processes right that's what a service
accounts for its offer human to use you

511
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,860
wanna make sure that's not happening

512
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,310
you'll make sure that service accounts
really use for one type of service and

513
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:55,870
that you're not reusing service accounts
across infrastructure you've got to have

514
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:01,000
some type of specificity to your account

515
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,030
taxonomy so regardless of whether you
identify people by a number and say RS

516
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,540
which is the Department 546 19 and
that's a specific user you know how to

517
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,029
track that back your privilege
management or you simply use a more

518
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,880
standard first last or first initial
last name

519
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,730
you've got to be able to tie accounts
back to individual people you'll be able

520
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,420
to them back to individual processes or
services and so that's really important

521
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,570
you can identify that during hunts if
different groups within your

522
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,520
organization business units are not
complying with the organization

523
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,430
standard this is really good information
to pass back to the security operations

524
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,180
wanna make sure that folks are using the
proper privilege escalation techniques

525
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,899
and that they're not logging directly
into machines as root right not a best

526
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:45,380
practice kid could you know make things
easier for a threat actor and it all of

527
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,910
this kind of like stacking usernames and
a threat hunting platform or just some

528
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,259
type of data analytics process allows
you to pick out the things that don't

529
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,900
make sense and that seemed a little
weird that you want to take into a

530
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,410
little bit more and then that last
bullet they're going back to that HR

531
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,730
termination work slow i love using that
example because we had a client who was

532
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:11,270
able to take their their provisioning
process and take all the users that were

533
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,240
terminated from the network and feed
that right back into their hunting

534
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,330
platform on a regular basis and
relationship with ir and they were able

535
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,090
to find some insider threat activity
that would have been disastrous to the

536
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,660
survivability of the business so I i try
to drive that home there are so many

537
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,990
different data points that you can
integrate to hunting and come up with

538
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:33,049
some kind of fusion model that makes
sense for your organization our laws are

539
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:41,900
going to tell us exactly no every time
to dolly or so we have we have

540
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:49,610
non-security utilizes the last time
anyone business is only for only

541
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:57,050
audience that pic both security and all
right so we have even stuff like this is

542
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,550
going to save annotation you know
disabled guess it's very very noisy but

543
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:10,400
you know to level with you now and
probably the basement here and we've

544
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,280
seen it sometimes is having your sensors
in the wrong places i see so many high

545
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,630
vs know that decided who resources

546
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:27,160
yeah just knock Mac ok 44

547
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,980
ok so let's try to get this mother
things so that one of the most important

548
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:39,370
ones to get more and skip the last punch
to the essence of time process execution

549
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:44,500
right this one's great as you can get
your host logs says on snare windows

550
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,530
longing right has litigated 0 points1
esq processes required for business

551
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,210
functions right

552
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,210
obviously this is really tough to do
when the user environment in a server

553
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,990
environment much more simple because
things should change all that much right

554
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:05,529
we found out he's getting powershell not
generally legitimate activity right

555
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:10,390
maybe cats right one time we went in and
were like on a hunch like maybe cats

556
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,100
keyword searches what is hit this
shouldn't you be showing up in logs

557
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:20,110
right we didn't want to draw the
background that was the the organization

558
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:24,400
that hired us to perform this hunt
assessment also had a pen testing at the

559
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,120
same time and the pen testers have far
exceeded their scope and it's called me

560
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,470
Cassidy controller

561
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:36,189
oops that was interesting you know
suspicious file names you get users

562
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,820
installing random crap where you know
the level to which you can do this

563
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,230
depends on your level of access controls
on your users they have admin rights on

564
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,040
your box

565
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,700
you don't even try to use environments
servers but still good one

566
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:55,870
I don't really want to skip or DNS there
was a pretty good talk earlier from the

567
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,980
guys from the NSA talked about a lot of
really cool stuff you find there so I

568
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,880
don't pick up his slides he is cool
stuff that I was like you know like I

569
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,570
need to go find out and check it out
some of the stuff we can find a lot of

570
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:19,720
good stuff 90s logs sure so I think you
had water rolls what was was your

571
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,879
justification to your hand it was

572
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:29,650
matters as to why you want to spend
cycles spitting up a you want to be able

573
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:35,140
to your environment you want to learn
from her old monitor you want to find

574
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,609
something you did is you bored I'm just
resting on the metrics because it's

575
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:46,300
vital importance of providing because
little to go to your boss's day and

576
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,970
finding awesome right now they're not
gonna lie but nothing is still something

577
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:56,200
another important one is the better you
get this little things are going to go

578
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:56,919
along

579
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,440
initially as you have to explain to them
as like reading really good

580
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,500
we have one more business doesn't sound
right

581
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,590
the first blush but they're going to go
up there go down and a good day as well

582
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:18,610
as getting other metrics like I was time
to take us behind and cool and we talked

583
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,970
about her maturing my methodology and
what that's going to look like in the

584
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:22,810
future

585
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:26,710
today we rely on system one thinking
right this is really intuitive stuff

586
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:32,020
this is an airless who happens to have a
network engineering background and

587
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,070
notices that something is off about a
particular set of packets hey there's

588
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,670
been some kind of kind of manipulation
hear that i'm not comfortable with let

589
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,660
me dig into that right or you might have
an admin that notices something former

590
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,730
admin that does something on a host of
that that mom seems quite a nautilus for

591
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,970
this individual based on their
experience right for the most part we

592
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,689
are in system one thinking today most
organizations that are building hot

593
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,410
program have some type of operational
programme don't necessarily have very

594
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,830
formalized methodology for how to go
about doing this right this isn't a

595
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:09,279
quantitative this is a empirical there
are like systematic process is applied

596
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,110
to how we go about doing this we simply
look at the data we manipulate the data

597
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:18,580
in a way that makes it more clear and
easy to understand as a human and then

598
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,480
we just apply our experience and
judgment of reasoning to it you know

599
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,940
through this through the lens of our own
experiences and we show that with our

600
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,750
team and say hey

601
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,170
you see what I'm seeing here is kind of
weird we follow that that down the

602
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,230
rabbit hole we follow the anomaly down
the rabbit hole until we can either

603
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:36,850
determine it is a false positive or
something evil or a way for people to do

604
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:41,049
an evil thing right to mature this
methodology and get to a point where

605
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,980
we're doing this in a much more
systematic a repeatable way that allows

606
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,840
us to scale teams and do this with a lot
more people than we are doing it with

607
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,350
today we need to get to system to
thinking and this terminology is

608
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:58,120
borrowed from you know Central
Intelligence Agency analytic tradecraft

609
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,890
right this is the way they go about
thinking about how to apply analytic

610
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:07,270
techniques to intelligence data we can
apply this type of methodology to

611
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:15,430
hunting as well we want to investigate
the ways that make the most sense for us

612
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:21,910
that are repeatable that are consistent
and that allow us to continue with both

613
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,910
system one thinking and system to
thinking right they feed into each other

614
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,290
system to thinking helps eliminate some
of the bias that we all of us here we

615
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,570
all know our environments right

616
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,340
oh we're hopefully right to a certain
extent we know our environment we have

617
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,300
biases about environments right if we
enact a policy that says we don't plug

618
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,830
USB a critical servers we might be under
this belief that we really don't do this

619
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,970
and so it's kind of a blind spot right
when you apply more structured analytic

620
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,529
techniques to this problem you develop
the ability to reduce bias and to

621
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:00,400
eliminate the risk or reduce the risk
that is to that that comes through bias

622
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,940
analysis from a more intuitive sample so
any questions that's actually the end of

623
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,540
our presentation hopefully this has been
useful for you guys i'm actually first

624
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,259
of all can I have a show of hands for
anyone in the audience that hunts today

625
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,460
or has hunted in a way that you know
kind of matches up with what we talked

626
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,300
about here today

627
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:26,200
awesome awesome awesome awesome and the
second question was

628
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,750
oh yeah so how many of you feel like you
got something new from this presentation

629
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,810
that you did

630
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:42,290
no before accent you got it feels really
good through there was something before

631
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:50,600
you use that was typical alright so
really cool questions get cool slat so

632
00:50:50,600 --> 00:51:10,490
he's got old questions and slavers how
kind of starting out you know the case

633
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:18,799
versus yes when you're when you're
working on validating your data sources

634
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,310
right so say you're building your
enterprise long strategy and you think

635
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:25,670
about say start with critical systems
right that's how you're doing your face

636
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,370
plan for making sure that you're getting
all the god you're supposed to get you

637
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,609
are going to want to perform some type
of validation on that data and so you

638
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,830
have a starter set of use cases right

639
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,520
why are you bringing in this data
headway validate that I'm receiving the

640
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,970
right information and so you would go in
with that type of Finance am looking for

641
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,180
something specific I want to be sure
that the data set includes the right

642
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:49,549
information to perform that protection
does that answer your question questions

643
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:09,690
depending on analyst experience
depending on how close the heart

644
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,100
operation is to security operations and
hydrated that is within security

645
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,450
operations write these organizations
have a closer relationship and you know

646
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,000
the analysts are more experienced or
less experienced they know they can lean

647
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,670
on each other

648
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:47,070
yeah definitely definitely I think that
I think that when you start getting up

649
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:50,430
instead of its a higher level of
maturity but you've already built a high

650
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,029
program and you have adequate resources
from a personal perspective you can

651
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:57,510
start specializing right when you have a
smaller security shop everybody wears

652
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:02,490
every half the bigger your group gets
their larger organization the more host

653
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,939
forever . if you have to be concerned
with their critical data

654
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,030
the more you can specialize in start
putting those out and maybe we

655
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,390
absolutely have the specializations we
have folks that are very now work

656
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,109
oriented I'm very network oriented very
much event log oriented and we have

657
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:20,550
folks that are in the host all the time
so when you what you want to do when you

658
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,550
have that type of specialization is that
you never want two silos people you want

659
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:27,450
them to work side-by-side and you also
want to have them evaluate each other's

660
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,750
findings because they see things from a
completely different perspective

661
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,890
alright cool I think we're done thank
you guys so much for sticking around

662
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,879
really appreciate it
