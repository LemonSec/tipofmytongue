1
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:57,270
something some something

2
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:12,690
Thank you Thank You Jake wouldn't do a
talk with no shoes this year I don't

3
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:23,130
know why but someone to do it for you
chick nail so yeah thnkx for wrapping up

4
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,320
your saturday a beautiful day out

5
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,830
what's it for clock the the fact that
you stuck around

6
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,150
I appreciate ah hopefully it won't be
too disappointed ya gonna be

7
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,630
disappointed but yeah what will will go
on with it so internet of terrible

8
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,960
can you hear me now

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,759
so a little bit about me yes bring
acrylics rendition infosec we're hiring

10
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,670
if we said they were hiring yet no prior
yeah we are all right I need a break

11
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,420
ah so contact information

12
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,410
alright so we're going to discuss case
studies of conducting network

13
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,619
enumeration using voice over IP
infrastructure and other embedded

14
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,270
devices i'm also going to highlight
attack methodologies used for credential

15
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,569
harvesting enumeration denial-of-service
and persistence practical defensive

16
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,700
techniques for the defenders in
real-world attacker mitigations via who

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,500
knew monitoring and secure configuration
which you know still tends to be a thing

18
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I don't how they got in there

19
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,540
yeah I just ignore that so times of
change

20
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:46,250
you know check out this some texas
instruments advertisement from 1982 you

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,459
know look at the specs on the computer
you know itself

22
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,819
yeah if anyone knows anything else has
changed you know maybe it's worth a

23
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:03,349
drone I don't know but yeah you know
times have changed where we're

24
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:09,619
increasingly more connected were more
aware more out there on the interwebs

25
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,750
and you know that's a problem

26
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,359
it pays Jake's daughters collegeville
tuition bill but you know hey you know

27
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:23,720
times have been changing so even though
they cancelled this I was like man I

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,120
really need to reuse this slide from my
u.s ma talk back in March cyber talks

29
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,780
Atlanta yeah the internet terrible
internet is going to kill you

30
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,739
spacebar beep boop bop flickr.com you
can read and it's a scary scary world

31
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,329
out there

32
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,480
next slide

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,980
damn internet you scary man you scary
this there's a lot of stuff out there

34
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,108
I'm just how are you even doing this

35
00:03:51,109 --> 00:04:02,720
it's just business but slowly ok rock
rap spine you Barbie

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,370
there's nothing creepy about this
picture though others have told me that

37
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,340
there is this is you know I was
dismantling barbie i took a picture yeah

38
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,340
i'm not sure where her head is now it
might be on is it still on your desk

39
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,340
that's that's even that's equally creepy

40
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:31,030
equally you know spiny Barbie so just
real quick rendition jumped on on on

41
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,758
hello Barbie purchased one of these
things took it apart it you know at its

42
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,050
core Mike banks you help with this huh
remember that barbie is kind of dumb

43
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,550
mean a lot of her processing and
intelligence was all cloud so Barbie

44
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,349
herself

45
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:53,919
I guess it worked you know humanizing a
toy is uh you know kind of dumb

46
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,090
um you know we could still do them some
things like you know let's let's hot mic

47
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,888
it it can be on you know throwing back
at dads car you know hot mic stand

48
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:09,310
you know kind of see what happens over
the weekend but you know hey embedded

49
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,039
devices doing things with stuff so we
have more these embedded devices as Jake

50
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,889
was talking about earlier in his talk
which is fantastic

51
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,909
a lot of embedded devices out there a
lot of things that are running web

52
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:27,340
servers and web services that are easily
exploitable not secure by any stretch of

53
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,340
the imagination and it's getting worse

54
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,210
this was a picture apologize you can't
see it so great

55
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,049
this was a delta airline and it's a
little in-flight entertainment system

56
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,440
booting up a linux kernel what why not

57
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,270
you probably can't see some of these
dates in here you know 2000-2001 you

58
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,469
know some how are they patching these
things I mean we still see Delta with a

59
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:57,310
you know windows 2000 computers you know
keeping the plane in the air so

60
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:05,319
hypothetically so yeah that's my point

61
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,849
more more embedded devices out there
many services much lols i said that

62
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,560
backwards but you get my point

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
living off the land I mean what are
their thing whatever what can we do what

64
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,710
would we see in real-world penetration
testing and vulnerability assessments

65
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,539
first one so that these are all real
world engagements are in condition is

66
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,539
done this is a air magnet whips wireless
intrusion prevention system armed

67
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,940
default credentials i was showing to the
client that oops i logged because I

68
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,840
tried admin first instead of air magnet
sensor as the user groups but you know

69
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,510
in a in a regulated environment you know
everyone's can constantly thinking

70
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,120
secure the endpoints cure my windows box
cure my server secure this but something

71
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,830
that's supposed to be filling a security
uh security role for you

72
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:11,510
let's just keep that default but not so
much this is a hate a web GUI level 15

73
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,750
exactly on a on a router in the same
network

74
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,320
hey a little command box let me know do
some do some clicking definitely things

75
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,590
you don't want accessible to your
internal users the quintessential webcam

76
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:35,448
so you know we see these all the time
default creds and it's cool to show to a

77
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,610
client you know you had a password in
their kind of zoom in and see what's

78
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,380
possibly on that gentleman screen I
actually you know because i don't have

79
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,479
much of a life that just kind of SAT
there and watched video for a while one

80
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,039
of the things i showed you the client
was i I turned I turned off a lot of

81
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,610
their video logging which is definitely
bad if you know you're you're hoping to

82
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,450
have that in your call center or
whatever this up you know I I hoped it

83
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:10,070
was the IT department this so i'm
watching videos and I see these two

84
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,050
ladies like just setting up this this
you know banner and taping it and then

85
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,770
as I'm going through video all of a
sudden a little bit a little bit gone

86
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,280
right so I was like all right I'll
isolate that exact moment in time where

87
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,789
that fell and you know maybe they'll
catch the culprit that rip this thing

88
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:32,779
down i don't know again I was bored so
around 22 am the wind blew and and and

89
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,429
you know it came down a little bit here
I thought that was great and you know

90
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,429
yeah like I said I don't need help

91
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,310
so this one alright so we have a we have
an ftp server running on a pc ups device

92
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:56,399
ok let's say rather large APC up device
uh in your rack in your data center and

93
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:04,199
instead of one will say I don't know it
doesn't all default credential ftp

94
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:11,969
server running I grabbed the config in
this particular shot so I mean hey who

95
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,389
cares

96
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,920
ok so you can grab my config for my ops
ok well what can I do with your config

97
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,099
let's see i can reupload new convicted
via I can enable ssh you i can change

98
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,829
your dns server i can enable telnet can
do all kinds of crazy stuff with it and

99
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,829
you know because i have your default
credentials i'll throw that thing back

100
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:37,199
up on there may be taken out of bypass
mode remove all your thresholds maybe

101
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,229
it's not really serving it up at that
point and you're not going to find out

102
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,509
until it's too late

103
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:48,300
full disclosure this was a credit card
environment credit card processor will

104
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,410
say hypothetically and you know what
what is one minute of downtime to a

105
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,509
international credit card processor help
probably a lot of frickin body right

106
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:07,649
this screenshot here they had their
their reading right SNMP community names

107
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:13,259
sitting in their block them out to
protect the innocent but you know things

108
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,639
like that

109
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,269
that's another bread from where i can
now start targeting more of your core

110
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:18,930
infrastructure

111
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,930
yes sir you in the back

112
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,440
how many devices where the SNMP
credentials share that well we owned

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,670
their solar winds box so i guess we
could go figure that out and yeah pretty

114
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,380
much yeah pretty much all and and typing
your company name and then putting prive

115
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,630
and cutting your company naming putting
pub isn't really obscuring or making

116
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,410
this community string any any harder to
guess justice and so the

117
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,779
bread-and-butter this one so i can go in
as administrator and I can i yeah reboot

118
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,800
ops now put it to sleep put it to bypass
i'll just turn the whole damn thing off

119
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,410
it and the clients like well how does
this affect me and we said well we'll go

120
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:12,540
and shut them all off and they're like
now so yeah hopefully in my . ah getting

121
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,599
onto the voice over IP infrastructure
stuff

122
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:27,270
shoretel IP 800 phone the the hostnames
called mistake it had default creds that

123
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,350
was a mistake

124
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,380
um yeah so what can I do from here

125
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,439
alright well i'll check out the numbers
you've been calling it at just so

126
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,560
happens this is in an executive
conference room we find out after the

127
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,300
fact this is one of three devices that
we located all default credits for

128
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,810
shoretel so at three in the morning I'm
like man i'll just call somebody so I

129
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,839
don't know whose phone rang but you know
demonstrating how could I could i hook

130
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,220
up a little headset could i rewrite that
traffic could i do some redirection

131
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,730
stuff you know can i call the CEO at
home and say there's an emergency can i

132
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,589
call the IT department say you know hey
don't come in until 10 tomorrow who

133
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:08,130
knows

134
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,279
can I call your mom and say you're late
for dinner i'll probably that

135
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,339
when the coolest things built into this
because why not you know you have your

136
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:20,450
little web GUI for this for this device
that's really just enabling you to

137
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,190
conference with other entities there's a
little utility in there had a pain trace

138
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,990
route some other kind of things I'm not
going to speculate what privilege level

139
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,360
on the actual device ping was running as
you know let Jake fill in the blanks or

140
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,750
or please review his talks and you can
kind of figure it out but I started

141
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,339
mapping the network in a rudimentary
fashion from an IP phone using default

142
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,120
creds

143
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,880
ok so they had a security operations
center as a stock analyst if you start

144
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,350
seeing traffic from this IP phone or you
gonna instantly séance an attacker got

145
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,990
a short health devices a piece of junk

146
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,170
it's a pinging all the devices in the
network

147
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,670
I don't need to be on your end . i don't
need to mess with admit I don't need to

148
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,660
mess with your antivirus iptables
argument mess with any of your other

149
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,270
kind of catch the bad guy techniques or
or countermeasures i can just hang out

150
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,660
here and kind of get a good initial
baseline of what your network looks like

151
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:28,880
so vaya this is a a big called
callmanager this does everything from

152
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,620
voice over IP a little bit of switching
stuff it does some conferencing another

153
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,320
default credentials sitting on the
trusted land in a in a pci environment

154
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,050
so I found out

155
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,969
well this thing's gonna sage go so it
only took me 22 sets of creds and and

156
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,480
then it's because I googled a PSR vaya
para default creds they had to the

157
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,820
second one got me in you know

158
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,510
hey welcome to New counts in my car
that's cool so so now we're sitting here

159
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:09,319
at as the user cost which is a via
hard-coded user that is you know for

160
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,730
first support of the device itself the
club does the client know that hopefully

161
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,709
hopefully that's in your kind of in your
in your lay of the land

162
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:24,109
knowing your network but yea cussed and
then custody 01 is a password

163
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm on ssh

164
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,340
so I didn't really show that screenshot
but if again if you saw Jake's talked

165
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,820
earlier that's the thing was running
linux to got six so yeah so I get on

166
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,300
there as user how how quickly can I get
to route

167
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,839
what can I do at that point I pretty
much owned all of your voice

168
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,980
infrastructure at that point I can mess
with your phones i can mess with your

169
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,870
traffic i can do all kinds of sort of
nefarious things and this thing's also

170
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,290
storing backups i was actually kind of
freaked out I thought that was a social

171
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,709
security number when I just put that
slide up and I was like oh crap but it's

172
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,080
not that's where no-one write that down
but up here you see the IP phone back up

173
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,870
so you know I grab my IP phone backup I
i unzip that i'm getting all kinds of

174
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,570
enumeration of users some of them had
titles in there you know this one's

175
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,040
pretty pretty benign but they were you
know CEOs office things like that

176
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,800
hey now I have another bread crumb on my
trail to owning all of your

177
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:38,400
infrastructure so I'm being 2.6 licks
compiled a a log rotate exploit our

178
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,949
sorry uh di through into a split . see I
needed a compiler because there wasn't

179
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,360
one on the device the device was
configured so it could not talk out to

180
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,390
the internet but cool i just threw a
compiler on my redirector cali box and

181
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,569
just the w get locally to that and there
you go

182
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:04,890
by now the compiler you fill in the rest
of the blanks you know its own so

183
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:14,340
voice-over-ip so i did a talk for the US
military academy and I discussed how one

184
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,240
of our largest instant responses that I
was a part of when i joined rendition

185
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,480
the head of the instant response said
hey if if you were in the network and

186
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,740
you were tipped off that we're going to
start this incident response in and try

187
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,880
to remediate things what would you do
and I was like I be in your VoIP phones

188
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,360
I'd be in your infrastructure I would be
embedded so deep in places that you're

189
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,950
not going to look for me

190
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,390
so after that talk i was like well

191
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:47,939
I should probably do another talk of
what I meant by that and here is what is

192
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,980
void definitely not that that's one of
the first things I'm like what is VoIP

193
00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:00,630
yeah there's too much to say about that
that's not what this so Astrix and

194
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:06,450
Astrix is a let's say what we'll say
it's will say it's a pbx right it's a

195
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:12,660
public branch exchange it handles your
rum it handles your public switch

196
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,079
telephone network traffic your voice
that traffic basically your phones are

197
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:24,629
talking through this thing where it's at
two turntables and polycom phone if

198
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,430
anyone's a big fan hopefully you got
that

199
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,710
what's in the box um sorry

200
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,590
so in the box after this talk I flip the
Columbus another guy that works suffer

201
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,590
edition Jeff he owns a pc recycling
company doesn't obey and he's like hey i

202
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,770
have a whole whole palette of these
polycom phones do you want when I was

203
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,430
like sure I'll definitely take this is
kind of how it came

204
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:02,980
let's move on so factory reset these
damn things right

205
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,630
um you know the boot server addresses in
there i found some other interesting

206
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,870
information that was kind of just
sitting in on the phone

207
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:16,299
there's actually a factory reset me
button or in the menu it's not that hard

208
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,710
especially if you're changing out
devices now this this polycom soundpoint

209
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:28,510
501 phones probably to era 2006-2007 at
200 + dollars apiece

210
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,010
are they probably still doing their job
in large environments or any corporate

211
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,700
environment yeah if they're working in
there doing their thing up I'm sure

212
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,490
they're still around just trace the IP
came out somewhere around washington DC

213
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,480
we'll leave it at that

214
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,039
so pulling up the polycom menu

215
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:53,408
sorry polycom provisioning documents it
was like hey if you want to make your

216
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:57,850
local machine the provisioning server
for all these phones just do it was like

217
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,549
haha awesome i also found out that
anything that you that you change your

218
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:08,500
modified on the phone itself where you
can set your your your boots server your

219
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,590
provisioning server syslog server
anything like that

220
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,059
hardcoded on the phone or entered on the
phone overrides anything that's

221
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:22,750
provisioned over the network so okay so
you have physical access there but i

222
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,980
really don't need to do that if you see
in this other slide you know it's

223
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,620
looking for phone one config and sip
config tftp so i can change that to ftp

224
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,320
i'll do a little ftp server my local box
i'll throw a default or modified phone

225
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,330
one config and a sip config in there the
phone just kind of reaches out with

226
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,529
default ftp credentials and says hey do
you have these files if you do it sucks

227
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,850
them up it consumes it reboots and it
runs like that there's no hey I don't

228
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,240
think you're really my provisioning
server the phone just does what you tell

229
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
to do because it's done like Barbie

230
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,940
default creds actually Mike's talked
earlier that plc MSP IP i saw i saw in

231
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,780
your in your top cards like number 11
right so I thought that was kind of

232
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,570
interesting default user pass 123
default hadn't passed 456 considering

233
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,360
these phones were not factory reset

234
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,889
can you guess what the what the recycled
phones credentials were all yeah the

235
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,309
default that's not a good thing not a
good thing

236
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:34,469
uh the phone itself little web GUI and
it asks for authentication so my cool

237
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,830
i'll bite on authenticate over HTTP

238
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:44,610
I mean we're dealing with default credit
so I was like okay not a huge deal right

239
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,590
but let's say you're like and I'm really
gonna really going to go in and secure

240
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:57,120
my secure my VoIP phones after this talk
know that it's still sending credits in

241
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,500
the clear

242
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,460
so in the packet we see little base64
encoded string we throw that in

243
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,450
powershell and comes out polycom 4x6
easy one of the first things I do when I

244
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,049
get internet any net is I just wanna run
wireshark for a while

245
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,360
RP capture and kind of baseline the net
you can capture those creds plain text

246
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,530
all day

247
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:26,850
depends which are going at so to kind of
continue my research I had to get a pbx

248
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:34,168
or at least I felt like I wanted to mess
with pbx astrix now is digium free linux

249
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:40,710
distro of freepbx it sucks to configure
anyone that does that for a living

250
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,960
configure these phones men I I really a
I applaud you because uh that the thing

251
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,620
just sucks especially in a vm it did not
want to play well

252
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,250
installing into vmware whatsoever but we
got it done

253
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,809
one of the cool things and this kind of
goes to the defensive side you know you

254
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,889
try to put in a password on therefore
route and it's like that's a dictionary

255
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:13,059
word I mean it's doing some rudimentary
analysis on what you're typing in there

256
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,460
and you know like a good user I'm like
yeah use any way cool oh you know it's

257
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,980
an IP phone and who would who would
target my IP phone and want the astrix

258
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,260
now GUI also comes up saying that we
have a default admin password default up

259
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,179
astrix manager password you know
hopefully people that are configuring

260
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:38,919
these things you know don't think that
this was built into the web GUI to kind

261
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,450
of alert you to these things for for no
reason at all you know obviously

262
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:51,130
screaming at you to change things so
calling your mom I think your mom's nice

263
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:57,880
i like talking to her on the phone
common attack vectors historically for

264
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,510
voice over IP infrastructure is you know
enumeration and get a

265
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,490
information-gathering enumeration
monitoring eavesdropping VLAN hopping

266
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,510
attacking authentication which country
did a little bit of denial service

267
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:16,600
flooding and spoofing caller Ids all
awesome things to do and we're going to

268
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:26,559
do some oh we're gonna do some sexy
things these spots so one attacker owns

269
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,299
your voice one of the coolest things
that for me and this isn't just a

270
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:37,690
polycom specific cisco also does this
some snom phones you know kinda pick

271
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,039
your pick your voice IP phone vendor and
and check this out

272
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:47,379
there's a sip notify packet that has a
check sink in there and basically what

273
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,419
this does is it goes the phone the phone
responds with the 200 ok and the phone

274
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:58,389
reboots and then grabs you can trick it
doesn't say who are you sending me this

275
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:05,289
packet it just says sure our boot so you
know if I have one taken over your

276
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:08,169
provisioning server at this point or two

277
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,309
masqueraded as your provisioning server
and kind of pointed you to my direction

278
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:17,408
to grab your config I can you know
widespread just reboot all these phones

279
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:26,169
have them suck up my new config and and
I went actually uh actually sitting here

280
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:30,549
remotely rebooting the phone you know
end up in the polycom manual like this

281
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:31,629
is an everyday thing

282
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,699
yeah extraordinary at admin tasks i'm
sure this saves many many man hours but

283
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:43,029
an attacker can use this to his or her
advantage and you know when your voice

284
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,919
there you go so force consumption of a
temper configuration to the phone

285
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:55,929
completely unauthentic ated so let's
think of a check sink d daus or daus

286
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:05,200
sorry I'm in your network you know let's
say my purposes art for exfil of data or

287
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,980
single collection so I've heard saying
that's just there to wreak havoc maybe I

288
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,109
start tossing all of your IT department
phones right i have these things just

289
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:21,070
constantly just a loop rebooting over
and over and over again and at the same

290
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,009
time I'm powering off all the ups in
your data center

291
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:27,850
I'm crushing some of your servers what's
your incident response really going to

292
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,840
look like you know you're relying on
this kind of stuff maybe you can like

293
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,738
tie a note to a rat and kinda like it
down the hall and hopefully you know you

294
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:36,700
get some help

295
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,029
um interesting interesting things here

296
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:49,149
so was it tight cat yep let's get
herding the cats you know with all the

297
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,539
notes on them is hard but

298
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,429
so there's hey an awesome python-based
packet forging tools i'm sitting there

299
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,399
with escaping I'm like all right I'm
gonna capture one of these checks inc

300
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:05,070
packets and then i'm going to replay it
maliciously and wrap that into a loop a

301
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,678
good thing this guy a nice Italian
gentleman mr. robert era made this

302
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,909
sipping python tool which basically lets
you craft sit packets whether it be a

303
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,080
specific message that you want sent to
the phone or to push new config to have

304
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,119
it reboot I used for the the checks and
packets and it worked like a charm

305
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,340
you know a couple switches attack s4
source tech d4 destination tech p for

306
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,899
port type in 5064 sip hit the Mego now
button and your phone reboots another

307
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:46,109
cool when I found special extensions so
if your CEOs phone is extension 3008

308
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:53,668
like an extension called notable named
3001 talking to think of 3001 now what I

309
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:58,919
can also do is I can set how the phone
answers that right so when i dial 3001

310
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,169
it goes to the CIO's CEOs phone i can
set that thing to auto answer with no

311
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:10,559
user notification at all and turn on
like uh you know that's a great way to

312
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,080
kind of monitor you know think of the an
attacker hot making a bunch of phones

313
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,099
and your security operations center to
kind of see you know what what what with

314
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,090
your scrambling after how are you trying
to get me what you're trying to find

315
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,988
next

316
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:28,979
maybe I just want a hot mic some of your
sea level execs if I'm trying to steal

317
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:33,330
proprietary information maybe I'm
competing business knows the fact that

318
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,759
this does that this happens that you can
just have this phone not even not even

319
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,029
ring once and just go poop into hot mic
just blew me away

320
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:48,690
yeah so yeah guilty knowledge now you
know please use it for good only

321
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,320
you can also do the same thing with a
group of extensions right so i can say

322
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,340
alright extension 9000 it's going to
bring these 40 phones i can do the same

323
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,908
thing have an auto answer I can have a
hot mic i can have it do all kinds of

324
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:06,830
stuff I can lock out the user just by
setting how I want this phone to respond

325
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,369
when called on this other extension now
to the user

326
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:15,139
I'm not messing with their normal
extension on adding something that is

327
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:22,218
you know not not not known to them they
don't know this is happening there phone

328
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:26,809
still responds and does all everything
is supposed to do except for when I

329
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,639
wanted to do something special

330
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:37,549
will do it if you're curious the VoIP
brought sip alert info one class you set

331
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:44,719
it to evaluate three and yeah it auto
answers without entering very easy like

332
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:47,659
i said this your ship config-if you
remember for your polycom phone by

333
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:52,369
default was looking for phone one .
config and set config so I make this

334
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,449
little modification by sipping fig i
hosted locally on my ftp or tftp server

335
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:05,119
i send a check packet to your phone it
reboots there you go i'm gonna go the

336
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:12,769
most scary in my opinion VLAN hopping
right VLAN SWAT beef veal and that's

337
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:19,909
that's excellent network segmentation
until you plug it into the other port

338
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:26,539
and then you're riding a trusted a
trusted veal and for your voice

339
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,889
voiceover IP phones which likely bypass
firewalls and proxies maybe you have

340
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:34,639
some content filter at your place of
employment that doesn't like you to go

341
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:41,119
to XYZ website you know this most
administrators and most configurations

342
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:48,559
we see you know the the voice over IP
VLAN is explicitly trusted rock on how

343
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,519
does this work

344
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,979
so you have two ports on the back your
phone right i will say VLAN 20 is for

345
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:58,970
the is for the voice over IP traffic
directly to phone and then VLAN 10 is

346
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,500
computer traffic right if you didn't
know if you have one of

347
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,730
these kind of IP phones let's say you
have a cisco IP phone sitting next to

348
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,990
your desk or one on each side of your
monitor I don't know I'm speaking

349
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,830
hypothetically here it's your gateway
your traffic from your computer goes to

350
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,280
the phone first and there's a little
like I said it's like Barbie phones not

351
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,300
very smart

352
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,490
uh no offense bargain sure she's really
smart real life and no matter but you

353
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,920
know it's not too hard to trick this
thing and say well i'm going to plug

354
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:41,240
into my my network port instead of the
pc port on the phone and then most of

355
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:48,260
these phones you know Cisco support CDP
spoiler alert the VLAN ID is actually

356
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,370
hard coded into the phone so if you go
through the menu and you type your 456

357
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,540
crazy admin password to get into the
thing you can actually see your VLAN tag

358
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,290
maybe I add that to my traffic add that
over here maybe I just start sniffing

359
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,290
for CD traffic and and I see my you know

360
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,790
voice voice VLAN ID there you go

361
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,490
rock on i am now sitting on your on your
on your voice VLAN instead of being

362
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:22,850
directed through your monitoring devices
firewalls we have you don't try that at

363
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:29,750
home and try them so there's some ways
around this you can you can google it

364
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:35,840
you know pretty much how to you can sync
all your IP right so if you're if you're

365
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,570
on your voice over IP VLAN let's say the
extension 3000 that phone is

366
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,590
disconnected you can then say anything
that connects on that interface will

367
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,340
just black hole that until we figure it
out that kind of gets around people

368
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,419
doing the whole plug-and-play grabbing a
new IP address on this voice over IP

369
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,070
land and rocking on that that's one way
to mitigate this stuff

370
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:05,629
also mr. Burt era does the sipping also
has a great blog post about how to how

371
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,300
to block and filter sip traffic using
iptables so two different ways there

372
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:19,690
haha so Kelly many metasploit old
versions of cali and will even say let's

373
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:26,470
say backtrack will say Patrick 45 you
had a lot of a lot more robust voiceover

374
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,600
IP tools current cali distros let's say
two you're going to see a lot of this

375
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,520
under metasploit in auxiliary voice and
auxiliary scanner sip it's mostly

376
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,639
enumeration scripts and then a little
bit of a funky voice-over-ip exploit

377
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,590
tools in there for you know client base
like a windows voice-over-ip application

378
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,740
things like that the old versions of of
cali or if you're going to go back back

379
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,500
quarterback backtrack you'll see the
seditious it dumps it crack too sweets

380
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,460
and that does everything from men in the
middle your authentication between

381
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,299
between your phones can dunk creds you
can mess with configs do all kinds of

382
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:21,520
cool stuff their future development step
tunneling i'm at that's not too hard

383
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,030
exploit next exfiltration . exfiltration
framework I think would be awesome to

384
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:33,610
see you know if you can ride through a
whole network through your scanning

385
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,979
enumeration your recon your exploitation
your persistence phases using nothing

386
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,549
but this sort of infrastructure and then
hopping between these embedded devices

387
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:44,168
and the callmanager and all that

388
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:50,679
do you really need to be on a windows
box no I mean it you know if I if I have

389
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,320
your avaya call management system can I
just map share to your file server and

390
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
start sucking things out that way

391
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,129
yeah is your stock analyst going to say
while this this call manager is is doing

392
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:08,770
some weird SMB traffic now maybe maybe
they'd be like huh that's weird right

393
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,770
more cat videos

394
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:17,040
enumeration trusted devices within the
information system i think i think

395
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,529
that's great i'd like to see some more
robust tools from the voice over IP side

396
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,820
to be able to just enumerate your
windows boxes you know in it and map for

397
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,100
voice devices so big and then flashing
custom firmware so these things run a

398
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:39,239
little you know lightweight embedded
Colonel linux kernel you know flashing

399
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,509
it like you would access point or
something like that

400
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:51,149
sorry the via via and in some Astrix and
Astrix distros actually are so

401
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:56,819
lightweight that that you can throw
these things on pretty much pretty much

402
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,740
anything it's not too incredible amount
of space maybe you could repurpose some

403
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,879
of this stuff

404
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,390
what have you it's wrapping it up
trusted can't be trusted right you'll

405
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,500
see it all over the place hopefully you
don't see in your own networks former

406
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,240
employer yeah they're they're
voice-over-ip VLAN was trusted and then

407
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,470
simply removing the plug from your pc
port putting into your network port

408
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:29,430
allows you to bypass buco proxy and you
know kind of hang out over there trusted

409
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:37,980
can't be trusted you have to don't trust
anything and then kind of and that kind

410
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,790
of allow more things more things out

411
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:47,340
lock it down first secure monitoring
security figuration modern for the win

412
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,540
monitor your network know what things
look like know what your traffic looks

413
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,020
like configure your device's securely
nothing should be default even if it's

414
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,259
something as as simple as a
defibrillator or a or an IV pump you

415
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,740
know make sure it's configured securely
that services are running in the least

416
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,209
least amount of privilege and and that
you're changing these default passwords

417
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:16,200
know your network better than I will you
know you do this for a while and you can

418
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,899
very quickly baseline a network you know
that every everyone that's involved in

419
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,130
the configuration and miss

420
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,330
duration of the information system as a
whole should know that Network way

421
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,340
better than I can in 10 minutes

422
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,060
you know pinging and doing some sniffing
from a from a from a calm and your box

423
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,600
and I don't know how this got in there I
got a little early thank you so much i

424
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:50,850
appreciate it any questions I'll take
some i know we have some swag stuffs sir

425
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,169
so I don't have any first-hand knowledge
on exactly how they were doing in our

426
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,619
service on phones i would expect that
it's a very same kind of way I mean you

427
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,210
can flood these things with packets but
still I mean that the the check sink

428
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,160
packet the fact that i can just send
that to any phone and and have the thing

429
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:29,549
reboot you know and loop is just is just
crazy to me i can speculate and say you

430
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,030
know that that's a way that I would do
it if I wanted to you know walk out

431
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:46,920
phones right yeah all tasks so yeah like
I said ask expanding out but after

432
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,829
paying but yes I i was researching some
some ways to kind of suck that traffic

433
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:59,130
out i believe it's called the name
escapes me now there's actually a tool

434
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,349
that's in that's in medicine Boyd or or
in the Kelly distros that that's what it

435
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:10,859
does is it grabs a cisco avoid traffic
and some other vendor . traffic and

436
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:21,029
converts it into wave audio files so is
there any ways area forward

437
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:32,359
Archie were described suit here the more
interesting it's interesting you say

438
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,160
that so I was actually uh reading just
before you know because obviously been

439
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,690
geeking out on this for a little bit

440
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:44,599
there's actually an open open worked pbx
type distro which open word has its own

441
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,970
kind of vulnerabilities there is there
is there kind of an open-source openwork

442
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,939
type distro for that I mean freepbx
comes in very different flavors you have

443
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,410
the digital version

444
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:02,480
astrix now which has all of your
features of freepbx which is destroyed

445
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,690
distributor the canoe public license

446
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,260
however digium likes to charge you for
other things they have some very cool

447
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,520
endpoint manager plug-in modules and
it's you know that they're

448
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,180
nickel-and-diming you nickel-and-diming
you there's a freepbx it's the main

449
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:26,868
project freepbx also puts out a kind of
more lightweight 3bx disc freepbx distro

450
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:33,680
that's more I guess I configurable that
does that answer kind of what you're ok

451
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,118
with you a question about the program
for the bones

452
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,299
yep yes and I yeah is goodbye

453
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:46,339
that's why I invited you take my mind

454
00:39:49,020 --> 00:40:00,240
you're not making any type of injury and
administrator so on my polycom and again

455
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,270
this is just a polycom 50 100 free
recycled phone here you know we stay

456
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,100
pretty busy rendition so I i do have and
my wife full what will back me up on

457
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,750
this just a pile of of phones that I
haven't messed with yet specifically for

458
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:21,510
the polycom the red light turned on with
a user be able to distinguish that from

459
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,610
you know it's also the same light that
alert you to a voicemail you know a lot

460
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,270
of people never check your voicemail and
I'm sure their desk is just a red light

461
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,680
always right

462
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,879
would you be able to tell I don't know
as far as logging logging on the phone

463
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,300
itself mean they're they're they're
pretty dumb i mean it will log to a

464
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,170
syslog server I in the default
configuration there was no syslog server

465
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:51,090
setup so yeah on the phone itself not so
much on the pbx side more so

466
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:57,870
however like specific task I haven't
seen logged granularly if that makes it

467
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,850
mom not going to the question for just
one I got one question I can anyone tell

468
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,230
me what the default polycom web
credentials are for a drone

469
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:25,110
oh I tell you what's the username what
polygon was it was a credit polycom

470
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,110
password is I'm just messing

471
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:48,339
georgia had a question that audit that
box back

472
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,119
I mean you would you would yeah you
would hope um you know some some vendors

473
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,529
have it that check sinks they'll still
support check sync with reboot but only

474
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:04,599
if the configuration changed on the
provisioning server so it depends on

475
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,999
kind of how you're doing that attack arm
you know if if if I'm if I'm becoming

476
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:13,629
the provisioning server then obviously
my modified times of my configs and

477
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,719
stuff would make the phone think that
they're brand-new if I'm just trying to

478
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,140
get it to reboot in that kind of
environment yeah that would have to be

479
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,170
an extra step i have to actually find
the provisioning server do some

480
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,109
modifications over there in order to
trick the phone to just reboot without

481
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:29,049
check

482
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:35,890
nothing i'm not that I saw in the pbx
I'd no no not that i saw you know again

483
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:42,129
for a 35 45 minute talk you know there's
there's this could be this could be an

484
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,239
incredible workshop I'd love to to get a
bunch of you know 20 phones out and we

485
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,380
can just go to town

486
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,219
however you know this isn't quite the
format for that but no haven't seen any

487
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:57,219
explicit login for that i would say full
take a packet capture or or even limited

488
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:01,329
packet capture inside your network is a
useful thing very easily you can look at

489
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:06,519
a sip packet sit notify packet with a
with a check sink message in there and

490
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,738
be able to you know block that or
redirect that or or do whatever inside

491
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:18,969
your network and hopefully that would be
your best mitigation I mean how often in

492
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,319
this scenario

493
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,449
thank you in the scenario where is on
the avaya right I was the the first time

494
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:29,259
I was the first user to ever log into
that thing pssh right

495
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:35,469
how often are you checking logs on the
pbx i'm probably not so much right and

496
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:39,819
again if your phone starts acting weird
and your phone is rebooting i think most

497
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:44,049
people are going to say supposed to be
scrapped let's get a new one not an

498
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:46,900
attackers on here trying to turn a
message me

499
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:53,619
so anything else some surprises

500
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:03,400
thanks expert
