1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
maybe one second here

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:37,410
all right maybe not forget that huh left
coming up yeah one sec oh really

3
00:00:39,030 --> 00:01:17,549
these horrible horrible and I white all
the back that's why this is well this is

4
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:36,329
just the sort of the presentation not
wanting to come out like so good friend

5
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,880
down one more time

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,850
okay well I go ahead and start talking
here in just a second or what let me get

7
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:56,460
back to the back of the box and I'll
download it again will come up

8
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:17,410
alright well not well we'll go this will
make this work better work

9
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:25,780
okay not the best not the solution which
one this one folks

10
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:39,490
ok alright so this one right

11
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:49,210
sorry about that we had we're going to
talk about raspberry PI's so today we're

12
00:02:49,210 --> 00:03:01,300
the talk how about a pizza party so I
get my nice a raspberry pi Raspberry Pi

13
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,350
this this was a want to get for the gym
cyber Summer Academy here we have this

14
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,840
at the center and a guest university out
we had a all the kids we have a hundred

15
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,920
yeah no not have had a 80 almost 80
students coming through the summer to

16
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,839
learn about cybersecurity and we use
that rather refined shown this is one of

17
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,200
our this is this is one of our dinner w
that we had our the survey that we

18
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,540
conducted open up the weekend so that
was our students that came to what what

19
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,799
we wanted to do was that we got the
grant from as you saw that on the first

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,620
page here was from a gin cyber from s
university with against university

21
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,040
decided to get the grand say the the gym
cyber program and that is the teacher

22
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,660
get to get the grant to teach students
remember weekend that teaching

23
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,590
cybersecurity but that we have ten
principles that we were trying to

24
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,810
instill still upon them i'll put the
comparable theta hiding which is

25
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,930
basically encryption another technique
that abstraction the main separation

26
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,930
resources calculation essentially simple

27
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,400
top modularity minimization least
privilege layering presents isolation so

28
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,190
these are all the the these are the
concepts that we wanted to kind of it

29
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,120
still up on the students and teach them
early about the building systems to

30
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,740
build these principles in and these
white I use these principles will build

31
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,390
water security systems just because
they're using these principles so the

32
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,099
way i go i approached a good about this
was what I wanted to use raspberry pi so

33
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,780
little bit about what raspberry PI's are
and why do we have with them so

34
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,570
everybody i think everybody probably
heard of resident private give me a

35
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,510
little bit boring history about it so
obviously the tiny little computer get

36
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:10,430
some this is the size of a typical
raspberry this is a little raspberry pi

37
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,980
that we used in the camp

38
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,420
this one is that at raspberry pi to the
raspberry pi 3 which actually used to so

39
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,940
I they are nice thing about him is there
football on computers they is got quad

40
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,020
core arm processor on these they they're
they're pretty powerful for whatever

41
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,700
this little thing humans footballing
operating systems run multiple operating

42
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,969
systems and and the nice thing about
them is they're easy to use the easy to

43
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,850
modify and hook up things happen because
they have a guy I opens on a minute let

44
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,950
you are that let you connect up by my
control things do do cool things looking

45
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,020
so our little bit of history about
raspberry PI's this doesn't work well

46
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,880
because by powerpoint slide that works
with a fly-in but the powerpoint died on

47
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,380
these look this up in the upper raking
corner up there that this is a raspberry

48
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,300
pi the original resident kind so there
was the the students several models

49
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,930
since they cannot make that the only
down for four-and-a-half years and

50
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,400
they've gone through several models that
was the original woman but one USB port

51
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,549
and and they are composite video out
that have hdmi they came out with a

52
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,810
second version here which is that this
is a model be

53
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,750
still had 11 a port but they did you
notice a little smaller to drop the

54
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,920
tripod support and then over here in the
third that this is the current revision

55
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,240
that this is the breath repipe sweet
actually has a reply to this is ready y

56
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,750
to but the resident Petry and through
your almost identical but they that they

57
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,470
now have a four USB ports and the hdmi
and with the residents we added what

58
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,560
wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to it and
then this is a little residue 50 which

59
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,520
we have which a five girls talking about
this morning as well so that that's kind

60
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,719
of a history where residents guys are so
there's been too many of these units

61
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,480
sold as of last week they saw the
temporary you so tell me those little

62
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,250
boards out the world right now as a to
celebrate raspberry pi just announced

63
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,120
that they came out that slow Raspberry
Pi 10 million anniversary special

64
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,440
edition resident I kit which you buy
from from now at a and it has a keyboard

65
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,550
in the case and some other stuff so that
was cool so it's so they've been a

66
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,640
four-and-a-half-year so 2 million units
very popular because that the the this

67
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,260
type of Raspberry Pi which is the more
portable powerful one so many $35 that

68
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:59,159
little red 350 like five dollars so we
this is the look so so so this is why

69
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:06,810
the referee price of power so this is
actually a raspberry pi 3 as you can

70
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:13,710
tell i said raper by three so so the
have the role of a GPIO pins appear that

71
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,359
lets you connect up in something so that
the that will give you output of 55

72
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,300
volts and the pens and they have
different functions will show you just a

73
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,520
sucker you still had said four USB ports
this is a 10100 ethernet port this is

74
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,250
the audio and composite video output
port has a this port right here is for

75
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:40,710
that one is the the camera port the hdmi
output this is your USB power in this is

76
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,719
for the for the Raspberry Pi display
that you

77
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,110
this is your main ship your arm
courtship and then this is a support

78
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,180
ship which is the purple shit the i/o
ship so that's basically what a what a

79
00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:01,000
raspberry pi 3 get to get you so so
that's the basic hardware the why we

80
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,360
like to use them it's because of this
picture here that this is the GPIO port

81
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:17,680
so so the gpio it's a it's a 24 pan
24-pin the header on the on the on the

82
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,579
board

83
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:25,689
I has power and ground out which is nice
but then it has a the other green other

84
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:30,730
green ones are general-purpose I owe you
can program these as individual io ports

85
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,750
so that you can control each pin
individually or if you set them up there

86
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,800
is PQ functions you can set them up to
run that's of these to appear will run

87
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:48,969
icc squid I swear CBS which is in turn i
see interface so so specific meeting

88
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,290
between i sees a you are standard you
are which is the old serial

89
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,439
communication right and then it has a
serial peripheral interface that hear

90
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:00,219
that that you turn out so so you could
so you can enable or disable these

91
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,269
functions that and you can use these
pants however you want so you use

92
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,740
expensive control leds promoters to
control lots of things that and that's

93
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,559
what's cool about the raspberry pi so
lets us use it as a basis for lots of

94
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:23,620
projects and cool hats and things that's
that's why I like a raspberry pi you

95
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,860
wanted so that you have some of the
things that give you the bars you can

96
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,279
use them to build a little arcade
emulator these are locking later found

97
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:37,149
at the the uses of this thing when are
limitless we have aa we can use them for

98
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,009
desktop computing III you within the in
the with the students

99
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:46,689
I had them actually use a raspberry pi
as the as the desktop so that you lot

100
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:51,670
lot of that and use it to program and
write the code in that so pretty cool

101
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,709
the are there really is a really really
nice Media Center's you take one of

102
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:57,369
these but I

103
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,740
case sit on your sit on this got hdmi
port you can set it on your

104
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:11,290
entertainment center plug-in integration
hdmi TV it can netflix cannot it can run

105
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,800
another run of special line stop XBMC
server called Cody which is really cool

106
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,790
so you can you even doing four games at
the the standard that the base operating

107
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,630
system has a minecraft it so you can
teach kids how to program minecraft so

108
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,550
that's really cool i can set them up as
a little servers to serve filed that the

109
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,689
users are basically in the on the cool
thing we'll talk about in a minute and

110
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:45,220
i'll show you the robots really like we
love robots so what are the basic

111
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,500
ingredients to make a raspberry pi you
going to make a reservation you use King

112
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,089
up until like two days ago you can go
out and buy the kit i showed you earlier

113
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,839
you had to kind of go out and get your
own kids can go on amazon by you start

114
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,779
kids but you're paying a lot of extra
money for somebody and you're getting

115
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,470
something somebody compiled two parts
together you may not want all those so

116
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,620
you have to figure out what you just
need a basic kit to get started so what

117
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,760
do you got to get so the basic thing
you'll be is obviously is a raspberry pi

118
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,910
motherboard you get the little
motherboard and that's your starting

119
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,850
point after that you're going to need it
would be nice to have a case but this

120
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,839
little plastic case or some part if you
don't want the case use us and standoffs

121
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:33,459
at least to have it up the computer
itself the rack computer has one

122
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:37,869
megabyte or 10 gigabytes of onboard
memory but it doesn't have any type of

123
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,060
storage so you need at least some type
of a you need a microSD card typically

124
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:49,750
to do store and soap and this is also
has a micro SD card rate you can do that

125
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,250
here so you get a little micro SD card
sized found this is a 16-gigabyte want

126
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,720
and you saw your own your operating
system on that in a plug in and Power on

127
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,610
are depending on the version Raspberry
Pi tues don't have Wi-Fi and bluetooth

128
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,170
so you would have to get I will

129
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:16,240
a little Wi-Fi dongle set the plug-in
and even a power supply that this uses

130
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,320
that stat USB power supply but I'll get
into that a little later and you

131
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,040
probably sometime keyboard mouse and
initially a monitor you can connect

132
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,420
these things remotely but anyway that's
nice that at least that this first

133
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,380
column is what you basically need to get
the to get don't get nothing your basic

134
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,149
that nice that never seems to have a b.a
yeah be able to get up to a network

135
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,709
that's nice to put heatsinks on the
chips I get a little warm if you're

136
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:46,060
going to do any real mess around that
Jackie out ports or programming anything

137
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,439
you're going to be in a i can probably
get some type of multiple check this out

138
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,550
it's really good handy pretty buggy and
then obviously you probably need some

139
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:01,990
small tool lets drivers and always good
to have around you . these once you get

140
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,170
it what you get those basic session you
can get down with the ego started

141
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,110
without you got yourself another
operating system we go out in her off

142
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,579
free operating systems on the internet I
the basis that the main operating system

143
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,859
is raspy and that's what most people use
that's a debian linux distribution

144
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,320
ah it has a basic its basic desktop
operating system has everything you need

145
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,339
to get going I it's it's a fairly secure
for the most part after you change your

146
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:34,300
password stuff is it's not is it decent
little operating system that makes them

147
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,490
w it's like a lot like a bunch of so
pretty easy to use some people use noobs

148
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,089
and the little dudes as it says its
intended for really first time it's

149
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:50,500
kinda a little bit more of a of a
package that it can it can help you get

150
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,880
started a little quicker but it's out
there eating it you can also get a

151
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,810
flavors of ubuntu and you can even run
Windows 10 on this thing

152
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,339
Windows 10 IOT core it now this is
Windows 10 IOT core it's not going to

153
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,990
give you windows 10 books into thinking
abilities but what it doesn't like do is

154
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,120
a is it works very well with windows 10
on your on your computer so so you can

155
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,779
program on your computer right visual
basic on here just a computer and click

156
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,499
a button download straight to the to the
Raspberry Pi and runs Parker around

157
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:25,029
resurrect pie and it's like all
integrating so you really don't know it

158
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:29,739
really treat your Raspberry Pi like and
accessories to understand those that

159
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:34,869
come with that one that then up the
course fun we're gonna talk about you

160
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:42,009
demands cali and you can also get things
like uh shouldn't it

161
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:47,379
ossc or this open elect these are the
media center boxes that are talking

162
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:47,949
about

163
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,218
so you put you down with this point it's
basically said media center of

164
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:54,819
operations you plug it in boots up into
the media center brothers got my

165
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:58,628
screening let you run media download
videos from youtube do all kinds of

166
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,529
stuff that's really cool and if you want
to go play the games like before our

167
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,029
video games you can get the stretcher
pie then you basically what you download

168
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,349
ones you saw it on us

169
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:13,419
SD card you need a probably another
computer do that like Windows 10 machine

170
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,739
what she would or Windows machines you
win 32 disk imager if you have a Mac or

171
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:24,339
Linux you issue that command line VD
this duplicator and I i I've reminded

172
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,839
the max i use this command all time is
the LS that I the image of the OS and

173
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,209
then however is devin values are disc
one because that director Robert much

174
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,679
faster than writing for the regular
dance convention I I after experimenting

175
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,209
the block size the normal block size
this is that passes i can get it right

176
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,329
with boxes for Meg so at that

177
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,469
thanks for invitation found that was the
best man line to get you get the right

178
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:57,069
out to the SD cards of match now I
played around a lot with the raspberry

179
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:06,099
pi so I suffered a lot learning these
things so you don't have two things that

180
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,638
you get these are the catches that you
gotta worry about when you're doing it

181
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:13,388
when you went to work in their building
raspberry pi system first thing is your

182
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,599
power supply i discovered this the hard
way

183
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,059
power supply quality matters I you want
to make sure you have a good quality

184
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,839
power spot don't use the power adapter
up your iphone

185
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,619
are your android phone and they say
there that they support the problem is

186
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:35,928
that that the rhetoric is really
sensitive the voltage drop and it draws

187
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,109
a lot of current so when it drops all
the current the voltage will drop a lot

188
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:44,720
and it drops below the five Holtz that
it would start crying

189
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:53,690
whoo-hoo-hoo headband it causes the
resume 520 not behave properly did you

190
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,029
can get bad rights to your SD card and
then the whole system anodized so even

191
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,929
that is a micro USB standard i recommend
you use it to be official Raspberry Pi

192
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:08,210
power spots there by over there about
each box but the what the reason that

193
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,789
you use their actually but they actually
supply five and a quarter volt output

194
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:18,830
not quite the USB standard but it
overcomes that voltage drop across the

195
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:26,418
wire and you get 5 volt at the input of
the of the board and that that prevents

196
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:30,169
you from having problems we have riding
problems with it to the SD card and

197
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:35,480
things like that so the the other thing
is some of the cheaper you gotta watch

198
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,239
out some of the cheaper I USB cables the
connection doesn't make it real

199
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,809
connection here I've got lots of lots of
times of averages and she capable the

200
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:48,408
connection here we get really loose and
pop out so you want to make sure you

201
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:55,220
have a good quality cable as well it and
some of the things that I edit the other

202
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,379
major gotcha found was that even though
its standard SD cards i found the type

203
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:06,019
of SD card matter cheeks SD card didn't
work well and the faster the SD card

204
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,340
reading the better and I mean that the
read the writing on the sdcard really

205
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,928
does have an impact on how fast the
system operates so I i recommend going

206
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:20,809
with the same disk or a samsung of class
10 card that writes a greater than 80

207
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,399
megabytes a second that gives you about
the best performance you can get I tried

208
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:29,869
at Kensington card that they kept
crashing on me they died and it is so

209
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:34,730
there's some of those off brand ones
that yes i would be Larry of them if i'm

210
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,669
going to be using a member at five

211
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,350
this is that operates it that even
though it isn't microsd card is not

212
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,949
using your camera where you just write
in to pitch to it every once in awhile

213
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:49,989
this is a this is actually acting as
your hard disk so the computer is

214
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:57,070
writing to a constantly and so the
performance and the and the you know the

215
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,439
quality of the card matters so spend the
two extra bucks and get samsung car the

216
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:09,700
car the sandisk card and save yourself a
lot so that's the learning so cool so so

217
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,899
so I got everything now i'm going to put
County links ok so this is this is what

218
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:17,049
school because i usually things that
make these little portable hockey rinks

219
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,929
out of these things up so these things
are great because look I got this thing

220
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:24,489
i've got $MONEY in my pocket and I walk
into I walk into your datacenter you

221
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:29,679
don't know I've got in i call it out and
and and have targeted that plug into

222
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,879
your network switch i'm recording your
networking thing you know hey it's

223
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:34,658
pretty easy

224
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,820
yeah anybody see mr. robot they put this
behind out as switching that in the data

225
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,830
center and use that break in and control
i actually use it to to overwrite the

226
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:51,549
the the the HVAC system and that causes
causes it

227
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,350
so so yeah that they're cool happy
devices but anyway so Kelly the latest

228
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:02,918
version i just checked Kelly just rolled
out a new release for PCs are you know

229
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:10,450
up until make species for max and for
mac level UPC level at 2.2 but the cali

230
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:17,649
for the raspberry pi is still 2.1 our
buddy we done with its a rolling release

231
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,498
which means that it will keep on
updating itself you want you update it

232
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:25,179
so it's pretty nice so that the first
catch it when you download that

233
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:29,019
raspberry pi image it's not the full res
rate it's not the full kali linux that

234
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,220
you would get when you download it for
your pc the pc is l that is it's it's a

235
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,299
it's a little bit different it's just a
basic operating system so if you want

236
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:42,429
the tools the cool hacking tools if you
gotta download the county many packages

237
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:49,179
so you want to get at a minimum the kali
linux top-10 that's gonna get you a

238
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,380
Madison boy in

239
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,970
wireshark aircrack those cool tools the
ones that you wrote that you want to do

240
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,710
the clock it those are the ones you got
to get and they get that you you just do

241
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,940
it a pit-stop kali linux step in to get
you

242
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,020
that'll never get Shepherd running it's
just cool hockey tools if you want to

243
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,850
what I go to the get the fold and you
got to do inhabit and stockpiling school

244
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,790
that all federal download all the tools
take some time but anyway that'll get

245
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,790
you there so we we build up

246
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:28,870
ah so you download the OS you can start
with the BB command are the two one

247
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,320
estimate you put in any power on and and
you're gonna you're going to get the

248
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,090
initial boots first thing to change your
password hit kids with the default

249
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,639
password it doesn't it's got a account
are graded effort route and with the

250
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,710
default password tour if you're gonna
hook it up to a network I i was that

251
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,760
next door over here and a couple of
these the scanning the first thing that

252
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,420
struck the first and the hackers
transfer and then they tried high that

253
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,870
the other another one that might run
into after you change the password

254
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,459
you'll need them to leave the resize the
hard drive partition because I got a 16

255
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,120
gigabyte card on here but I downloaded a
an image that was about three and four

256
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,649
gigabytes only put support gigabyte
partition on here so i had to resize the

257
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:20,950
partition and I had just use that the
built-in command parted and I go in and

258
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,060
I set type of party and you select the
partition for the hard drive and they

259
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,649
set the max size once you do that then
you run the resize to FS command that

260
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,790
besides policies and now you've got the
full 16 years that card available on on

261
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,570
the SD card today and set up networking
and then you're off and running

262
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,969
oh it's a recent change password i said
that the initial even even on the on the

263
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,600
on the raspy and if you doing recipe in
the initial password Matthew do you can

264
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,169
be my raspberry and if your little cali
that we root or those are the first

265
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,590
things you gotta change so what you once
you get once you get it up and running

266
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,509
yet you never figured the next thing you
want to change your

267
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:08,599
x 0 so these things are the images
aren't like that you get on here aren't

268
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,989
like an iso image that doesn't install
and as you're doing the install you're

269
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:15,169
creating accounts and you're configuring
times of their thing

270
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,039
it's already configured so with and most
of the sense of respiration I was built

271
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,929
in $YEAR it's a British product it comes
with the British time zones and British

272
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,719
keyboard setup so you going to get a
setup

273
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:30,529
it kind of the keyboards the right
locale all that to you

274
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:37,009
english us are whatever flavor of a
language you want to use but I I

275
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:42,799
preferring this you ask if i don't speak
any other languages I that I set up

276
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,739
network and then if you want to use
those up

277
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:51,169
I of course you have to enable those and
think in the in the recipe in that menu

278
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:58,069
so that puts it and then what then with
a cali you want to do you definitely

279
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:03,859
want to do a cali you want to do a a
update your OS that I you you up to that

280
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:09,289
potential just hear a distro package and
then you could do that if you just

281
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,489
upgraded and metal update everything to
the latest versions of all the packages

282
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:23,059
that are on there and not get your
running if you run Kellee and you

283
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,869
probably do some type of vulnerability
scanning then he can eat open passes

284
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:30,978
available you can doubt you can get that
by doing a napkin saw open paths and

285
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:35,569
then running off of that setup and open
that setup takes a lot because it's

286
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:38,899
download some a lot of CDE packages is
huge

287
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:42,859
it takes a few hours to do that even
with the past cards on on on the referee

288
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:48,769
pot magic-user and started up here you
can run the that you can run up faster

289
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:52,489
than the real B and C that's good that's
a good one to have

290
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:57,379
so you can remote in and and what about
the other machines that little portable

291
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:02,629
hacking Raspberry Pi hacking big so this
is this is where my ingredients and I

292
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,550
get it

293
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:21,139
but isn't that a touchscreen so it's
like a little 70s show a tablet and got

294
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,640
the red raspberry PI's installed in here
it's gotta let people camera installed

295
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,770
and it's pretty cool so so that you know
what let's be a you know that take the

296
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,730
city but pretty much anywhere and they
go to my hack so that you know I said I

297
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,480
getting set 7-inch touchscreen
touchscreen case this is a cool little

298
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,290
thing to haven't ya and take around up
you're gonna be a keyboard mouse i like

299
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,340
that i like the little logitech keyboard
mouse here that won't I get that one

300
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:55,610
that's a that's a thirty-dollar mouse 68
combo over staples now or 30 or 40 bucks

301
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,360
those are good but you know that's great
but yeah i'm walking around with my

302
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,639
raspberry pi and this isn't forgotten I
don't want to have to put the evil Mouse

303
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:20,780
so so i get it and i got a little but
that's fun but sometimes it's a little

304
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:32,510
bit too big so i really got it yeah a
little

305
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:38,570
so this is your little remote got a
little funky little pad so i can put

306
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:49,669
that in my pocket and boom I'm going I'm
hacking alright so let's find up is that

307
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,980
cool stuff happens that yeah keep the
little little of the motive

308
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:03,800
now but what I found out was that red
grape I 3 has built in Wi-Fi but it uses

309
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,720
the Brocken chipset and rock n shit set
isn't fully supported by said it works

310
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,010
ok and decently with the foot with raspy
and the the which is the official

311
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,110
distribution that that rather packed

312
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,189
for our organization supports so we so
ready and worse

313
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:28,160
ok with the built-in Wi-Fi McCallie the
is a little bit behind is Carla hasn't

314
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,490
caught up with the new version of
hardware raspberry PI's up

315
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,670
ah wait if you want to do serious
hacking you gotta get at least the

316
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,780
little ed max this is a little easy max
adapter here tonight

317
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:49,399
no double the 802 11 and Wi-Fi adapter
250 megabytes that was what i found out

318
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:56,840
that i couldn't run in that and do basic
skimming off of the built-in Wi-Fi on

319
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,030
the resume pi/3 with the x so i went
ahead it but I put blood in this easy

320
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,168
max one sec police gets me the
capability to do basic training because

321
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,850
this Colonel sports but instead get me
full what I needed because if i wanted

322
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,709
to do really really good get it

323
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,660
wireshark do some deep the the
promiscuous most canning and made it a

324
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,660
rock scanning of the actual network and
easy

325
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:40,070
yeah nice that down here so it gives you
a better reception but it's bigger and

326
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:45,678
it's a little more clumsy but that quite
as fancy but but at least this one will

327
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,200
get you up let you do

328
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,710
Rama road traffic monitoring of the
network and see everything on the

329
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,250
network so this will but with this thing
then you can start with some air

330
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:00,980
cracking cracking Wi-Fi cracking Wi-Fi
WEP and wpa password this you won't you

331
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,840
won't be able to do that lets you get
one of these on the Raspberry Pi are so

332
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:14,449
tight-knit mechanism to that level
that's pretty cool so so we got that now

333
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,580
let's build a robot danger will wraps
and we're gonna build a robot

334
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,110
well that that that's going to be that's
a little bit much but week but

335
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:35,760
so-so but here's a quick shout out of a
of robots making a raspberry pi i

336
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,320
thought that robot robot manipulator
raspberry pi for this is this an actual

337
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,260
robot making around if I this lateral
robot that the red chord but anyway back

338
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,520
to this is what I we're actually going
to build is this this is called a pie

339
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,850
board city morgue

340
00:30:53,850 --> 00:31:05,070
I thank you come back with her second
microphone

341
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:11,760
hey uh this is made bag again captain
england as his backup I bored and eat

342
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,320
you it comes as a kit has the set 6 12
motors and run wheels

343
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,299
I it get the chassis parts and
everything to put it all together and so

344
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,408
you get the kit the only thing you have
to spite your Raspberry Pi it also has a

345
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:28,049
mouth / camera the resident back camera
if you want to

346
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:31,650
so by the raspberry pi camera there that
there as well so let's go

347
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,669
so that's what you get when you start
out and then you have to put all that

348
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:48,780
together so that the UH the uh.this this
piece right here is the critical piece

349
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,649
to the whole thing this is the truth
because people aboard reverse that's the

350
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,179
controller that that controls the butter
so that's basically you're here your

351
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,490
motor controller for the for the front
of the wheels so the the reservoir

352
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,480
basically talks to it and it doesn't set
of voltage to the world and then that

353
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,890
thing will apply the voltage of the
little that then it will run around up

354
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:21,210
but yeah I got that kit and it came with
global runs on the season little adapter

355
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,080
here in double-a batteries that but the
batteries with a bit of a pain sighs

356
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,879
look I could do better than that i went
out and got RC car battery 12-volt RC

357
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,000
car pack 2011 hours10 cell

358
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:42,790
that kind of battery that supports fast
charge so if i use a little this is a

359
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,540
little fast charge here i can change
that sucks that turns out better fact 15

360
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,520
minutes and that'll that'll run for
several hours on the resume file it i

361
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,710
can run around about two hours 2-3 hours
is that battery pack and they can charge

362
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,450
in 15 minutes and you have been writing
so so so that's cool so I made a little

363
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:08,679
bit more so I have a kids build it the
summer and the cancel here here always

364
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,169
help kind of helping them out and
getting started there you can see they

365
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:15,280
put them together there they start out
and they're adding up putting them all

366
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,330
together and then they add the wheels
they were really excited about getting

367
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:24,309
this and going to get that kind of got
it built than they were when they got

368
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:31,780
out and they tested them and Madame
around someone broke so we had to have a

369
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:41,260
Pitts that's the pitch as you think we
have to come it pops you there is and

370
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,200
what that 17 the wheel fell off we had
never prepare you to get because they

371
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,830
were they were pretty good these are
pretty tiny parts and they held some of

372
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:55,059
them didn't happen together some of them
the quality-control wasn't quite as good

373
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,899
and then this is our are in fueling
station back that's all of our battery

374
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,860
chargers and the this little batteries
you can see that little charger so so

375
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,149
we're going to identify multimeters like
debugging and everything so that was

376
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:16,510
fine we took him they took him over to
the group and they set up there there

377
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:23,950
there little man center let me put it
here in the we're able to lock you out

378
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:30,730
great call these the robots Tom and then
make do they were able to take it rhymes

379
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,690
with a random visits through not we had
an obstacle course setup and they ran on

380
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,159
precise it was around around come to
things like that so that so that was

381
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,889
cool so let's see here just going to
work

382
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,629
no video because that was supposed to be
a video

383
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,649
huge LOL alright so the video doesn't
not going to work anyway so the video

384
00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:05,578
rain here they went around anyway so
what the students learned was ok so the

385
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,470
students aren't how to use the raspberry
PI's up which is great they none of them

386
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,959
really have any experience with the
raspberry pi so they were able actually

387
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,099
you know this is the first time they're
putting together computers and putting

388
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,539
putting together parts and things like
that so they actually saw it

389
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,509
they're used to seeing cellphones of
veteran then they can see it shipping

390
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:31,230
this so they didn't really know what so
they actually get to see chips and see

391
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:38,069
pins and it you shall never actually had
that what a computer really is and then

392
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:43,170
they're able to see that hey yeah i can
log into these things and they said with

393
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,869
one when you when you first time up

394
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:50,069
these things are totally insecure
anybody could remotely log into it and

395
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:54,359
the end something kids took advantage of
that they said 10 log into that one over

396
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:59,098
there and hug it and so that you know
some kids are trying to login to do

397
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,660
things the other killed me another kid
will be trying to login and and get kind

398
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,470
of got a little mess with that we had to
put a ban on hacking in class but

399
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,359
benefits

400
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,598
it was fine but but I get you the point
is that they they get to see that hey i

401
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,710
have a have a computer at ikea truck
went with it when I when I do certain

402
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,599
things that cut causes yeah cause the
motors get it actually causes real-world

403
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:31,859
effects so we we show them that that you
fight by hacking and doing things you

404
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:37,049
can great things that that can have
effect in the world so we have to have

405
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:41,730
sexy actually see consequences to think
they were doing that that was part of

406
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,749
the cool thing

407
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:46,680
uh yeah obviously the you definitely
learn to make security doesn't like me

408
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,368
privilege I get you don't want the whole
world have access to your robot because

409
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,339
anybody can log it and take it over

410
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:02,069
are you know that that was the basic
that they give us a basic core portion

411
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,540
of class

412
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:09,259
so they go ahead from that lots of cool
stuff but you know what we're going to

413
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,960
go next with this is ah yeah I want to
add more sensors on to this like right

414
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,030
now it's just that it's it's it's a
pretty much a remote control car at this

415
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,490
point because the way to what they do is
they they they run a web server on here

416
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,490
that creates a web page that you log
into the web page from the web page

417
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,500
basically has it has directional control
go forward or back and let right he

418
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,720
connects the camera but it but it's
pretty much up

419
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,149
it's pretty much just a remote control
you can write programs on it that says

420
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,130
they're go Mikey take journal app go go
three vtec turn right

421
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,600
yeah you do some basic stuff like that
but in order for you to really become

422
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,520
and become cool in is that we want to
put the essentials on it so it became

423
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,950
more autonomous so we can say that
follow your fault line are you running

424
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,210
to you to find a wall and don't and then
. spread the wealth around all the

425
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,250
things that that cool

426
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,730
sometimes things don't think I'm gonna
be doing as i'm going to set up a resume

427
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,770
pack clusters I i want to get about 20
to 30 of these and hook them up as a

428
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:24,710
cluster and I couple couple confident
again there's a one of my creative

429
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,860
capture the flag caneva that a field
where they're going to be able to

430
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:36,560
remotely log in its ally this cluster of
breath requires and pipelines so i will

431
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,120
be able to go and turn out lights and
fraternal buzzers and do cool stuff like

432
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,980
that but even at one point i'm going to
try to get I got a bunch of these robots

433
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,760
yeah I got a map that I think that you
in the chest when another cool thing i

434
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,010
want to get them to do so

435
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,450
so the robots off our apartment sleep
HSE that would be cool

436
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,290
I and that i don't have security and
running here so so if anybody wants to

437
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:08,360
compile security you read three pilot
you know but I'm gonna be attempting

438
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,359
that so so I I talk to . he won't he
want the pilot for every pie for me

439
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,369
I my about anything like that but that's
what I think that's what i think im

440
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:22,839
gonna try and try to be too because I
think needs to make cool sensors because

441
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:26,470
like I said they're so small you could
be anywhere in the network set but

442
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,160
that's basically where we're going with
that so that that's kind of where I am

443
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:38,558
so I open it up for questions and
answers and you know it

444
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:58,390
sure yeah well ah that that's what for
my for my little hacking regular this

445
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,470
will get here

446
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,220
yeah i-i've actually have Howard this
with that with a for the the battery

447
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,480
pack so yeah that works really well so
you know you have a self-contained

448
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,980
almost like a laptop that's what does
look over here actually a little bit

449
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,670
more convenient to take for hacking but
the business school because you know

450
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,069
it's kind of different and get you

451
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:21,069
it's a little small and you could you
could you could drop it behind or

452
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:35,380
something like that that's going to open
up about patent alright so so in order

453
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:41,109
for them to remotely control what they
did was the name of the recipe and

454
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:45,069
operating system on the Raspberry Pi
they ran a web server on the Raspberry

455
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:48,730
Pi then everybody connected to the to
the web server that thing's been

456
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,769
committed to the web server web web page
had that happen controls on it so they

457
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:57,788
were able to remote control that either
through a computer make it also

458
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:03,309
connected through your phone I'll i was
going to try to set up a demo but I ran

459
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:06,549
out of time and I don't think I have
enough time to get going here but but it

460
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:12,640
actually actually actually it's a so
it's more like it's more like Kevin

461
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,680
kinda like the remote control is kind of
like be immersed in the parrot drawings

462
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,730
in the same thing where you control your
iphone works a lot like that yeah

463
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,799
alright well I get a couple i get my a
couple of questions here so is this an

464
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,890
administrator since this is the
Raspberry Pi session get the hacker

465
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,210
playbook

466
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:55,110
does anybody know who the creator of
Raspberry Pi close that nobody but yeah

467
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,890
that's it

468
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:31,470
so anybody recall the name of the robot
keyboard and i think i heard it over

469
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,020
here first it
