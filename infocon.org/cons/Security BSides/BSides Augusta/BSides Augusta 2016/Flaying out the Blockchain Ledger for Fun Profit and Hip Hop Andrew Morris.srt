my buddy Colin mean him did all this
work together arm like we did all the

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,329
all the research and he was pretty much

all of the sequel queries that had to do

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,679
with this because he's a really good

but he did the guy Edwards can

31
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,900
ruff who is the author of the blockchain
parsing library

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,980
hi blockchain is getting syndics on
youtube who has this amazing amazing

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,530
youtube series on explaining the actual
Bitcoin paper he takes every single to

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,130
every single sentence and he makes like
a 10-minute video out of it and it's

35
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,990
like five hours but it's totally worth
it

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,230
I'm Tom get hard to do that wrote this
really nice block chain parsing guide

37
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,829
her partner is another one of my
roommates to actually gave me a really

38
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,210
brilliant idea of how to do some big
data heavy computing stuff that I needed

39
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,010
to do situation Nakamoto for writing the
Bitcoin paper whoever you or they are

40
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,070
the author's the Bitcoin developer
documentation which is exceptional

41
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,709
the two guys that got invited to Conti
years ago that led to be making the

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,280
worst joke of all time and my company
and game for just being a generally

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,380
amazing company to work at and enabling
me to do this research so this is going

44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,820
to be the outline of the talk i'm gonna
give and all just kind of go through my

45
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,850
one there's a pastebin link up there if
you want to write that down

46
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,920
that's going to have all of the links
and hashes that i'm going to be

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,600
referring to in the talk so that way if
I mean because i'm going to have I mean

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,239
if you know anything about Bitcoin you
know there's a ton of like transaction

49
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,470
IDs and wallets and basically stuff like
that you guys im gonna have on the slide

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,260
but you guys aren't able to write down
in time so go ahead and take down that

51
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,030
paceman link i just tweeted it also for
my Twitter so if you want to follow me

yep absolutely yep

57
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,930
ok alright so I see this

58
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,310
my name is andrew morris this is my
twitter i work at a company called in

59
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,130
game on the research and development
team

60
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,910
my background is actually an offensive
cyber security stuff on his pen tester

61
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,390
for a while the red team for a while i'm
doing majority private sector self

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,890
little bit of government work I've been
doing computer related things for the

63
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,459
majority of my life and somehow I'm
still kinda bad at it I dropped a high

64
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,269
school younger I didn't do any
counseling or anything so I kind of have

65
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,960
a different background of looking at
things and i really like just computers

66
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,310
in general playing music and

67
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,060
reading stupid jokes today I'm speaking
on behalf of myself not speaking on

68
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,150
behalf of my employer i do work for a
company called in-game it's an amazing

69
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,210
company but I'm not representing them
today this is not their point of view

70
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,120
this is my point of view is my
recreational research all they did was

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,740
just let me do it

72
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,030
I'm so again this is me I'm just talking
about things that I observed i'm not a

73
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,530
Bitcoin blockchain expert which is a
silly thing to say when you are doing

74
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,219
and talk to people on Bitcoin blockchain
arm but the reason that I'm saying that

75
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,260
is because bitcoin and watching are
massively massively complex and I know a

76
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,690
decent amount about it but um I am by no
means an expert and if you hear anything

77
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,530
that I say in this talk that is
incorrect or you think is incorrect do

78
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,229
not hesitate to call me out in the
middle of talking not gonna embarrass me

79
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,780
or anything like that I don't want to
spread any kind of misinformation this

80
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,099
is actually really hard stuff so I'm
gonna do my very very best so let's get

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,620
into it on august 26 there's this guy
named Martin shkreli and he bought the

82
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,050
wu-tang clan exclusive wu-tang clan
album 42 million dollars

83
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,530
nobody knew it at the time because like
an anonymous guy buddy but he did it he

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,039
bought the house the wu-tang clan had
been recording an album in secret for

85
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,400
like five years or something like that
he bought exclusively for two million

86
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,479
jobs then on februari 11 2016 that same
guy tries to attack on us

87
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,430
he's trying to bike on us new album that
has yet to come out the life of Pablo

88
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,000
and trying to buy from him and he's
trying to give him 10 million dollars

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,110
and have on us only give him exclusive
rights that out or sets three days later

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,110
Martin shkreli claims to have a bunch of
my soul he tweets quote who the fuck has

91
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,550
my 15 million dollars i need my money
back

92
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,180
this isn't a fucking joke WTF somebody
someone named daquan said he was Kanye's

93
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,919
boy and I signed the deal to buy pal bow
and sent the Bitcoin call the police

94
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:31,650
this is bullshit arm so I saw this and I
knew in just enough about Bitcoin know

95
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,419
like I might actually be able to get to
the bottom of this so i had a question I

96
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,159
was basically like 15 million dollars a
ton of money

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,080
the bitcoin bitcoin I know just enough
about Bitcoin know that Bitcoin records

98
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,039
all transactions that happen on a
distributed ledger the ledger is

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,280
publicly available it's not encrypted
it's available to anyone it's actually

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,289
distributed to everybody in the Bitcoin
network so i want to replicate the

101
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,160
ledger gonna get the ledger and I want
to search it and I'm gonna see if I can

102
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,380
find this 15 million dollar transaction
that mr. Scarlett was referring to

103
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,270
so basically given a date range fine
transactions that colony certain USD

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,240
value range final transaction is upon us
even on and actually before I don't do

105
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,140
it if I want to switch this to like
pokemon community that because i can't

106
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,750
see presenter mother

107
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:38,800
sorry sorry folks just do if not i can
just keep on a second

108
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,980
yeah I thought maybe it was a popular oh
it was all my fault

109
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,940
thank you into work it was all my fault
all right back on track so is it

110
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,750
possible to find this transaction so my
approach is basically i'm gonna

111
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,130
replicate going to get the ledger

112
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,730
somehow i'm going to parse it all out
parts all the transactions i need to get

113
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,140
into a consumable format of some kind
and shove it into a database and i'm

114
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,469
going to write some queries gonna ask
the database of a couple questions and

115
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,840
then i'm going to review the results and
that's it

116
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,200
so let's see if we can get to the bottom
of this is basically like the pseudo

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,090
query that I'm thinking in my head right
given all Bitcoin transactions over

118
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,719
select star from all Bitcoin
transactions ever wear the date is in

119
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,550
between iron faery tent and very 14-5
Paisley four days leading up to it and

120
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,520
the US dollar equivalent of the Bitcoin
transaction at the time is somewhere

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:41,890
between 14 and 16 million dollars so now
i'm going to talk a lot about Bitcoin

122
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,189
raise your hand if you're familiar with
Bitcoin alright

123
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,210
raise your hand if you know how Bitcoin
works okay yeah everyone's like

124
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,440
ok bitcoin is actually really
complicated i cannot possibly word it

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,209
any better than some random guy i saw on
a forum you just said on a forum post

126
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,619
some guy wrote hey can you under explain
like something something about Bitcoin

127
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,149
and this other guy responds

128
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:09,720
bitcoin is not something you can sit
down and understand in a couple of hours

129
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,230
that guy was absolutely correct

130
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,269
bitcoin is actually really complicated
so bitcoin is a cryptocurrency it is a

131
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,100
peer-to-peer cryptocurrency as far as i
know it is the first currency that I'm i

132
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,459
have ever know there may have been other
cryptocurrencies was certainly the first

133
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:27,750
big one

134
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,339
I'm there is no central authority which
means there is no trusted third-party

135
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,279
what does that mean what does a trusted
third party

136
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
well if you send somebody twenty dollars
on paypal to buy a pair of shoes and you

137
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,490
receive the shoes in the mail you open
up the box and there's a dead rat in the

138
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,510
box

139
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,260
you're gonna be like what wear my shoes
and you're going to open a ticket with

140
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,220
paypal and they're going to say ah I got
you and they're going to reverse the

141
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,010
transaction so you're going to get your
money back because it's a trusted third

142
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,170
party right but if you have twenty
dollars and you go up to somebody and

143
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,969
you give it to to buy a pair of shoes in
person and a punch in the face and they

144
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,209
run away you can't like contact the US
Mint to get them to in value i can you

145
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:17,189
guys just invalidate the the the the
serial number on that twenty-dollar bill

146
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,130
that i just gave that guy no you can't
do that there isn't a trusted third

147
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,790
party in cash transactions there's
nobody to overseas it likewise with

148
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,050
Bitcoin there is no trusted third party
when you send somebody Bitcoin you can't

149
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,500
unsend the Bitcoin no one can reverse
the transaction it's cryptographically

150
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,120
infeasible think of it as like as cache
of the internet right on it uses known

151
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,079
cryptographically secure protocols to
ensure the integrity of the transactions

152
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,209
on use a distributed blockchain ledger
to record all transactions as i was

153
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,880
talking about earlier you something
called a proof-of-work to prevent double

154
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,750
spending prevent double spending double
spending is basically just having a

155
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,649
Bitcoin and spending it and then turning
right back around and spending and again

156
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:58,800
to somebody else when you can't do that
because once you've spent a Bitcoin then

157
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,649
you're basically you in

158
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,410
order to double spend a Bitcoin you
would actually have to you have to do

159
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,610
all of this you have to crunch all of
the cpu cycles that something that

160
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,180
everybody else in the world crunch in
order to get to that coin in the first

161
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,998
place so you have to compute all these
very very heavy computational

162
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:19,740
transactions would take years and years
and years to be able to fake a Bitcoin

163
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,009
transaction it's cryptographically
feasible i get a little bit more on that

164
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:24,389
later on

165
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,209
oh and by the way a proof-of-work is
basically just something that is

166
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,800
difficult to to achieve the first time
but it's easy to validate I'm so

167
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,300
basically what that means is if you give
me like if you say if you say hey Andrew

168
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,209
arm is this is this word in the
dictionary and you give me a word and

169
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:48,899
it's gonna take me a really really long
time for example if the word is is in

170
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,800
the dictionary

171
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm in the dictionary doesn't isn't in
any kind of order it speaks words can

172
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,279
take a really long time to find it but
then if you said if I said yes it is

173
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,019
after I found it after 10 minutes i
found it it's on page 24 and then you'd

174
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,920
say okay and then it's really easy for
you to just open up the page 24 and find

175
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,179
the work so it's hard to the first time
but it's easy to validate that thing is

176
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,019
correct

177
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,189
I'm everything is audible and
accountable back to the Genesis block or

178
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:18,360
whichever block it was mined from you
can trace every single bitcoin all the

179
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,300
way back to Genesis block or two a
corn-based coins are mind i'm basically

180
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,349
by crunching cpu and by calculating hard
doing hard cryptographic equations kind

181
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,160
of like mining gold out of mountain
between uses a non turing-complete

182
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,839
Bitcoin specific scripting language to
validate transactions as if it wasn't

183
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,050
complicated enough they have their own
programming language it takes

184
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,498
approximately 10 to 15 minutes to
validate a Bitcoin transaction if you

185
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:52,439
want to know more than i recommend you
read the Bitcoin paper when you send

186
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,990
somebody Bitcoin you're actually sending
them a Bitcoin what you're doing is

187
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,970
you're signing the coin value to rips
recipient in a way that allows them to

188
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,240
be the next person that spends the
Bitcoin so what that means when you send

189
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,059
somebody Bitcoin you're not you are i'm
not losing them out and they're not

190
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,029
getting him out there is no state all
that's happening is I'm basically just

191
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,199
saying somebody's somebody at some point
told me that I was the next person that

192
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,870
was going to be able to sign a Bitcoin

193
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,890
then i'm signing over i'm saying all
right now you are the next person that

194
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,500
gets the sign the Bitcoin and that's
basically you're the next person who

195
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,000
gets suspended it's a chain performs
chain the transaction is broadcasting

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,350
the entire world to the rest of the
Bitcoin network and only the recipient

197
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,589
can spend Bitcoin all transactions are
known by everybody inherently the

198
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,060
network actually self-regulate something
called difficulty difficulty is a notion

199
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,709
that where the more people that are a
part of the Bitcoin network at any given

200
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,370
time the harder the cryptographic
equations cryptographic the proof of

201
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,790
work is to achieve to generate the next
block

202
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,620
so what that means is if there's 10
people mining Bitcoin then the proof of

203
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,430
work or the thing that the the math or
the crypto that has to be done is going

204
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,750
to be kind of hard and it's gonna take
those 15 people about or 10 people about

205
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,350
10 minutes to do it and then it thousand
people also enjoying the Bitcoin network

206
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,310
it's gonna make the dog the math a lot
harder it's going to add a lot more

207
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,300
difficulty because there's so many
people mining bitcoins wants to regulate

208
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,760
so that new blocks are harvested once
every 10 to 15 minutes and the dollar

209
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,140
value fluctuates with Bitcoin as it does
with any currency that's not a Bitcoin

210
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,670
thing that's just an economics thing
that's how economics works and to get

211
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,300
into a little bit the way the bitcoin
price is actually turning I'm not an

212
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,900
economist but the way the press bitcoins
determines basically by currency traders

213
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,920
who just say this is how much cash i'm
willing to spend on your hundred big one

214
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,110
something like that is Bitcoin anonymous
kind of everybody knows about every

215
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,520
single transaction so in that way it's
less anonymous than cash but you don't

216
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,300
know who the wall it belongs to in real
life so that way it's more anonymous

217
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,439
cash one person can use lots and lots of
wallets it's actually best practice to

218
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,490
use more one wallet per transaction
that's what like that the super hardcore

219
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,529
Bitcoin people say Bitcoin can be mixed
and tumbled to make it harder to trace

220
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,250
basically just means shifting around to
a bunch of different wallets and then

221
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,630
going to where you ultimately want to go
to there i'm sure there are legitimate

222
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,080
reasons why bitcoin should be mixed

223
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,400
I don't know what any of them are but
i'm sure they exist and what can be

224
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,490
created offline without any in

225
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,399
that access to receiving not to create
Bitcoin but to receive it which means i

226
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,640
can have a computer that is not
connected to the internet I can generate

227
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,660
a wallet i can generate a Bitcoin wallet
i can take that crap that publicly i can

228
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,010
write it down and I can go and I can
tell somebody hey send this wallet a

229
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,760
bunch of Bitcoin and then they can send
that wallet Bitcoin and I and then I can

230
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,540
clean that Bitcoin whenever I want but
you can't spend bitcoins unless you are

231
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,680
attached to the end of people can send
as much money they want to a wallet you

232
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,859
specified because we remember you're the
only one who had the ability to sign it

233
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,080
off somebody else is Bitcoin secure i
mean i want to say yes like the

234
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,320
cryptographic protocols are very very
secure implementations genius if you

235
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,370
read the Bitcoin paper it's it's
actually I mean it's really the guy

236
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,570
thought for the people thought of
everything and there are attacks against

237
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,709
Bitcoin on their unlikely but they're
not possible the biggest one is

238
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:26,170
something called 51-percent attack which
is just when 51-percent or more of the

239
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,839
Bitcoin network of the blockchain
network elude together to make something

240
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,209
that happened like 2i change something
that happened in the past or to do

241
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:43,180
something this that or the other but
it's very cryptographically in peace i

242
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,699
mean obviously if you do have fifteen
percent of people that are willing to do

243
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,959
that and that's fine but they're one of
the defenses against the quote

244
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,550
51-percent attack is that if you have
51-percent the members of the members of

245
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,939
the Bitcoin network you're gonna make
more money just working for the network

246
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,930
when you are trying to change something
that happened fast most likely because

247
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,760
of the way . works mostly attacks just
affect having shitty optic and that's it

248
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,839
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
the blockchain raise your hand if you

249
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,059
know what blockchain is all right all
right reason and if you know how black

250
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,309
Jean works

251
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:28,178
yep that's about me to all black chain
one watching is a list of every single

252
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,160
transaction ever it is a giant series of
linked lists in the form of serialize

253
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,590
data it is an eternally growing list of
transactions and basically

254
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,210
it's a big depending on what you mean
when you say what is what is the ledger

255
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,260
mean aren't there like the blockchain
technology and it uses a ledger

256
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,370
distributed ledger the ledger is always
the same it's the same everywhere and

257
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,090
always grows in the right it always
grows in the same way home also as a

258
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,320
side note if anybody does something like
if I'm hosting ledger and I do I might

259
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,389
be quite make a change

260
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:07,810
Tom I and I tell somebody else about the
change like like two people mind the

261
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,220
same Bitcoin at the same time then what
happens is and I we both had that on our

262
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,170
ledger and everyone's like replicating
from us then whoever whoever it is that

263
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,160
mines the next Bitcoin whoever they
trusted is the one that moves forward

264
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,220
and the other person just loses their
big so that's how it works it's the

265
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,690
longest chain of trust self

266
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,290
I mean we'll talk about that a little
bit on computers are incentivized to

267
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,860
host the full blockchain ledger in
keeping the keeping everything going by

268
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,250
getting rewarded for mining bitcoins I
receiving Bitcoin for mining Bitcoin

269
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,000
basically if you are mining your proof
work if you are part of the coin ledger

270
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,220
and you are part of the Bitcoin network
and you are mining Bitcoin then you are

271
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,700
there's a chance that you will achieve
the coinbase you will achieve the proof

272
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,310
work create the newest block and you
will receive a number of Bitcoin there

273
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,510
was just something called behind having
so i think until recently you would

274
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:10,690
receive 25 Bitcoin now you received 12 i
think that right told that that makes

275
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,290
sense

276
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:16,240
math and so and that was I mean there's
a time when it comes 1000 always pop

277
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,100
right now it's floating around like
500-600 I think arm

278
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:27,280
yes it's floating on six understanding
man 12 Bitcoin 600 ish box pops lot i'm

279
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,350
so nothing in the past that's ever
happened blockchain can ever be changed

280
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,990
it is hashed on hash on hashed on hashed
so if one thing changes in everything

281
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,370
else subsequently is going to be
invalidated it's no there's no state to

282
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:49,120
block chain necessarily its chain the
log of activity along the blockchain is

283
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,959
made up of blocks blocks are made up of
transactions

284
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
transactions are made up of inputs and
outputs and output is a wallet sending .

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,720
sunnah wal kinda what an output is it's
kinda like I was telling you before an

286
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,330
output is me saying you are I am I take
this amount of Bitcoin and I'm signing

287
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,830
it to your wallet

288
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,928
you are the person who is allowed to
spend it next I'm an input is somebody

289
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,970
else saying you I acknowledge that you
just sent me those bitcoins I claim that

290
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,049
i am more i'm claiming those coins and
then they would turn around and output

291
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,760
them to someone else

292
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,490
great so every input every time someone
claims Bitcoin they're going to point to

293
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,510
they're going to have they're going to
reference the output that they got the

294
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:40,149
Bitcoin from so anytime I say all right
I'm ready to spend my bitcoin part of my

295
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:43,658
part of the data here is for me to
reference the output that I got it from

296
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,899
and likewise the output that I got it
from before

297
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,330
did the same thing and it forms this
giant linked list and output without a

298
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,080
corresponding input just means that the
coins have not been spent

299
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,080
so if you're looking to think about the
watching ledger and you find an output

300
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,649
and there's no input with a previous
hash value pointing to it that means

301
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:05,979
that those coins haven't been spent
there just hanging out

302
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,549
so if you want to access the blockchain
like a total noob what you can do is you

303
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,760
can go to block chain that if I'm just
kidding this is how everybody accesses

304
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,750
the election going to want a blockchain
explore there's a lot of free ones

305
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,159
watching that info web BTC calm and
listen right here there's a ton of these

306
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,890
I mean there's like there's like 50 of
these websites you can use to like click

307
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,909
through the blockchain click-through
Bitcoin transactions stuff like that

308
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:35,260
there are tons of um one really cool 10
is called a de which I think stands for

309
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,029
a blockchain explore and that's an
actual offline one so you feed at the

310
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:45,100
raw serialize blockchain data and it
will actually build your own offline

311
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,209
blockchain explore it's a pain he asked
to get setup but I have a solution to

312
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,970
that which i will talk about Charlie
this is what watching that info looks

313
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,200
like if you never been there for its
great website basically this is the

314
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,010
height so that just means that's which
block it is the block height is what

315
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,400
block number it is the first-ever block
the Genesis block was blocked number

316
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,030
what I was at a height of 1 the next
block had two is now old block is when

317
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,500
the block was mine

318
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,600
this is how many transactions took place
inside of that block this is the total

319
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,260
amount of USD value in all of the
transactions that took place in that

320
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,850
lock this is the relay my field which is
basically like whoever was advertising

321
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,840
whoever advertises that they were the
ones that mind that block so they have

322
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,179
like a there's a mining pool or
something like that

323
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,750
announcing it to the to the world
wouldn't mind it I'm and this is the

324
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,770
actual data size of the block the data
size of the likessee realized at sitting

325
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,970
on the ledger of the block if you want
to actually access and address the page

326
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,030
is going to look like this you're going
to get a QR code watching that info does

327
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,810
some really fun stuff for you mean it
converts however much money the wallet

328
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,679
has received how much it sent all the
transactions that's had etcetera

329
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,430
this is what transaction looks like a
Bitcoin transaction has something called

330
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:04,220
TX ID or transaction ID which is just a
like a uuid a unique identifier for any

331
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,590
transactions ever happened on but this
is that's like super 2015 and there's no

332
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,580
way to do the thing i want to do which
is show me all the transactions above a

333
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,570
certain dollar value in this time when
you can't ask Bitcoin watching not into

334
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,720
that because it doesn't have any way to
tell you those those api's aren't

335
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,240
exposed it has the data but it doesn't
give it to you in that way so you just

336
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,860
have to go around clicks up which isn't
how I wanted to do things at all so also

337
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,860
maybe you don't want somebody to have
logs questions you're asking and I'm

338
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,310
aware of this so to reiterate this is
the actual transaction that I want to

339
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,899
make I want to say show me all of the
transactions that happened in a given

340
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,040
date range that fell under a certain USD
equivalent range at that time there are

341
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,129
some cheat codes to do this i mean there
are easier ways to do it than how I did

342
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,980
it but I didn't really realize it at the
time

343
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,390
you can download a dump of web BTC comms
Postgres database which is about 80 gigs

344
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,830
compressed in you we decompress it's
about a hundred eighty it's about a

345
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,669
hundred sixty gigs and it's a giant
Postgres database so you can get it from

346
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,330
there

347
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,199
I'm the other thing is you can generate
the database yourself with 80 which is

348
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,500
the blockchain a blockchain explore the
same for offline blocking explore this i

349
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,850
found a guy that dr. eyes

350
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,530
it and made it way way easier if you're
familiar with docker like you can

351
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,780
literally kicked off the whole thing
with one command

352
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,139
it's amazing that command that I've
written here is literally you just type

353
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,790
that command with the serialized
blockchain let your data and and it'll

354
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,389
rip everything apart for you it will
take forever it will take a very long

355
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,650
time and it will take up a lot of space
but if you're not worried about time and

356
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,850
you're not worried about space

357
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,709
I'm then then that's the way to go and
you'll get that the interface right

358
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,700
there basically just it's very similar
like a stripped-down watching that info

359
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,000
mm-hmm

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,040
ah so how are we going to pull the
ledger part well the ledger is made up

361
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,200
of dat files there is currently about
600 hundred and twenty-five $OPERAND

362
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,880
megabyte . dat files on their name to
such BLK 0000 . that followed by be okay

363
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:21,110
0001 that I'm and each DAT file is a
serialize binary blob containing about a

364
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,500
hundred and twenty- for continued
exactly hundred 20 megabytes block chain

365
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,490
letter data each file contains blocks
each block contains transaction each

366
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,660
block contains a header in transactions
and each transaction contains inputs and

367
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,290
outputs the data structure is complex
but only if you don't know anything

368
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,790
about data structures which I did not
before i started doing this this is my

369
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:51,080
military-grade powerpoint skills of like
rapping with the blockchain what what

370
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,860
the actual block by block looks like it
black hair wrapped wrapping around

371
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,510
transactions with an input and output
section there are itemized inputs and

372
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,629
outputs uses and then like I said
there's blocks and blocks and blocks and

373
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,840
blocks so how do you actually get the
ledger how do you get the data

374
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,500
well there's a number of different ways
the right way to do it is to install

375
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,020
Bitcoin core on a server lifespan of a
digital ocean node for three days ensure

376
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,760
that you have about a hundred you ponder
dish

377
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,450
gigabyte screen of disk space and then
you just replicate the ledger over a

378
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,090
couple of days you're just pulling in
from everybody else

379
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,330
I'm you're building a ledger and after
three

380
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,330
I mean I want to say it depends on your
internet connection but it doesn't

381
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:29,679
really

382
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,480
because it takes time to build the
ledger together it takes time to pull it

383
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,570
down it's not it's not gonna be
throttling it's not like it's gonna be

384
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,649
flying in

385
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,770
I'm so it takes longer it's gonna take I
mean it took me I think the first time I

386
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,040
did it for days to build ledger on it
was on a really fast internet connection

387
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,480
on when i did this in July 2016 is about
80 gigs it's been growing like a mofo

388
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,780
that recently so it's it's gonna be it's
gonna be pretty

389
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,919
it's gonna be pretty big if you want to
get the fast and lazy way then you can

390
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,880
download a torrent of the larger files
if you want i haven't actually uploaded

391
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,650
this but if anybody wants it i just get
in contact with me and all all uploaded

392
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,320
torrent file you can see it and we'll do
it like that

393
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,870
I've seen a few of these hovering around
the internet and you really when you do

394
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,620
this the good thing is you don't have to
worry about anybody doing anything like

395
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,739
putting any bullshit on the ledger
because if you're trying to download it

396
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,940
and then loaded into bitcoin core to
validate it won't load if the ledger if

397
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,210
like the ledger data if there's anything
that screwed up and it'll air out

398
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:31,480
nothing will validate it will work so so
you can get you can get you can get the

399
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,320
ledger if you find a torrent there's
very low risk of it being tampered with

400
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:43,030
unless you don't validate it um this is
what it looks like the letter just a

401
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,139
bunch of hacks this is a hex dump of the
letter so it's actually I mean it finery

402
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:53,080
it'sit's serialize data but this is a
hex dump of the ledger and I looked at

403
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,610
that and I was like okay I don't know
what to do with this but the answers are

404
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,479
in here somewhere

405
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,410
so then I'm like I gotta rip the whole
thing apart which means i have to learn

406
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,950
how to use likes trucks which presumably
you learn in my computer science stuff

407
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,560
tonight wasn't fortunate enough to do
that so I started out by like mapping

408
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,179
out by reading the the Bitcoin developer
documentation and mapping out the data

409
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,090
that the fields and then I like that is
a map that I wrote in and I was just

410
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,179
like going through mapping out i had
like a key like all this kind of stuff

411
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,180
on I not the right way to do it

412
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,970
parsing blockchain sucks so I started
writing i did start reading parser via

413
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,770
this guy's guide this is a great guide I
Tom get are ready i don't know who that

414
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,500
is i chatted with him a couple of times
but I've met

415
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,000
but if he hadn't written that guide i
would have been so lost i started

416
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,110
reading i started writing my thing
following his guide but it was indeed it

417
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,800
wasn't exactly what i needed to be but i
did i did reference it a number of times

418
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,440
so he really really helped me out with
this

419
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,050
I found a couple of libraries that did
close to what i needed but I but not

420
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,649
exactly what I needed and then I found
pie blockchain which was committed to

421
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,490
get help like literally several weeks
before i started doing this project so I

422
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,260
was like thank God so i use that it did
exactly what i needed to are almost

423
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,760
exactly what i needed to you i'm also
shout out to this guy's inor 987 who

424
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,170
wrote a tool called block our search
string c++ he read in like 2011 it

425
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,160
worked great when the ledger was like
one gigabyte but the ledgers like 80 now

426
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,920
so it was like loading everything in a
ramen doing something and can't really

427
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,750
do that with us

428
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,830
so these are the things that I need for
the sake of my use case right i wanna i

429
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,310
want to do this big sequel crease I
gotta rip everything apart there's a

430
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,550
train I need a transaction ID just so i
can reference everything was something

431
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,260
else I need a payer wallet receiver
wallet time in transaction the Bitcoin

432
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,770
value in the u.s. devalue there's a lot
of problems with this there's a lot of

433
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,250
problems with all these things for
example like transactions aren't just a

434
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,660
plus and a minus number it's it's a
giant linked list of inputs and outputs

435
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,710
so you can't it's more complicated than
that but figured touching that a little

436
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,970
bit more there's a notion of change in
Bitcoin which is basically all I think I

437
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,900
touched on a different slide the payer
isn't something that is specified in

438
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,540
Bitcoin ledger only the receiver and a
reference to the output that the person

439
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,750
uh whoever had the Bitcoin first so
basically like everything needs to be

440
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,920
linked together to get the payer i dig
into that a little bit more exchange

441
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,830
rate right there is no us devalue had
pieces like in the in the blockchain

442
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,330
ledger there's no like there's no Field
in the block header that says like this

443
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,139
is how much u.s. dollars bitcoin is
worth today like now so i have to derive

444
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,480
that myself somewhere else i'm a big
data like that really you know it's like

445
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,170
80 ish gigabytes when I ripped
everything apart in like text got a

446
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,410
little bit bigger but it's not like big
butts big for like my home computer

447
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,140
and in transaction patterns this was a
huge pain in the ass this is basically

448
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,000
as Bitcoin has evolved when the when a
private key is being validated by the

449
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,740
bitcoin script programming language
inside the actual bitcoin bitcoin client

450
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,090
anytime a transaction is being validated
like or anytime about transactions be

451
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,500
pushed to the ledger

452
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,220
they're different patterns of pushing
and public key and validating it with

453
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,830
like different op codes and it's not one
standard everyone there are slightly

454
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,449
different implementations she trained
yes transaction ID had so remember this

455
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,800
is the first thing that I need to get
transaction ID is actually super easy

456
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,500
it's just a shot 256 the entire
transaction and that's it that's not

457
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:46,170
that hard right by the next thing is
time time is actually also really easy

458
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,540
there is an epic timestamp located in
the block header all i do is just

459
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,230
convert that to daytime why didn't even
have to convert that to daytime but I

460
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,030
put that in the database is a UNIX epoch
times and it's right there

461
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,950
super easy the receiver wallet is kind
of heart

462
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:11,280
like I said wallets and addresses our
shorthand for public key so on what it

463
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,180
actually is

464
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:21,960
his wallets our wallets are a public key
I sha-256 and then sha-256 again and

465
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,070
then chopped apart and then rearranged
in certain ways and salted with

466
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:33,810
themselves and appended with like a
version idea i think so the data that's

467
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:39,510
actually on the ledger is not the same
as the wallet the UTM like a website i

468
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,320
mean you have to do some work to
actually get Bitcoin script pushes the

469
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,639
private key data to like a stack and
then it does like it sends the

470
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,750
validation opcode and like that's how
about stuff I'm Bitcoin script is really

471
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:57,900
similar to the programming language
forth if you're familiar with for media

472
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:04,620
I'm this is where script will be script
is part of the output I'm it's the data

473
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,929
section the app I think of it as the
data section

474
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:12,270
of the out there like I said there are
lots of different script opcode pattern

475
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,860
there's about like really 99.999% of
transactions in blocking are going to

476
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:23,219
fall under about six different patterns
the library that i'm using parts

477
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,260
watching pie blockchain the guy

478
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,170
bless his heart but he only implemented
one pattern so there are so I was like

479
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,870
okay and it was because I mean like I
said he had literally committed this

480
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,320
thing to pick to pick to get out like a
week before so I know he's like

481
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,460
implementing more and chatted with him a
little bit i'm the only implemented one

482
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,370
pattern so he would have really only got
like you know ten percent coverage and

483
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,760
all the transactions so I ended up
having actually crack open source code

484
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,990
and right and like basically court
library and write a couple I've ever end

485
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,260
up writing two more patterns into it
like the ability to recognize your

486
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,610
patterns and so with three of the six
patterns you end up getting 99.5 percent

487
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:06,899
coverage i am missing data so when I did
crunched everything I got 99.999 . five

488
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,860
percent coverage of the entire block
chain of all transactions i'm i'm

489
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,980
missing data but unfortunately everyone
just gonna have to deal with it

490
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,909
I'm and I didn't do anything there's
also a multi-segment multi signature

491
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,420
transactions which I didn't even try to
screw it because that's just too hard

492
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,100
there wasn't time to change problem that
i was talking about the court so i have

493
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,360
a Bitcoin wallet with 20 Bitcoin and i
want to send five Bitcoin Kanye West I'm

494
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,260
so what I'm gonna actually do is I'm a
cryptographically signed five Bitcoin

495
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,240
con us public key which is built upon us
address which is just a different form

496
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,560
of public key and then I'm going
cryptographically sign 15 of those

497
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,150
Bitcoin to my own public key or to a
different public key if I want to be

498
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,710
even sneakier and have the private keys
for business right so like I said

499
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,340
there's no state there's no there's no
like transaction when you make a Bitcoin

500
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,440
transaction it's not like minus five me
plus 5 you it's that I'm basically I'm

501
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,470
gonna chop it apart and then say i'm
giving myself the next one because

502
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,899
everything is like lists of lists right
if you're only looking at the outputs

503
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,280
you don't have the inputs then change
transactions and non trains transactions

504
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,100
are indistinguishable there's no way to
know the difference so you need the

505
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,290
outputs to figure you need the inputs to
figure that out

506
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:24,270
you need the entire chain salts because
you need all the inputs if you're gonna

507
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,190
be like having decent look at the
outlets and like i said if i have out

508
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,560
because of this problem i'm talking
about right now if I have a hundred

509
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,680
million dollars with Bitcoin and I copy
for five dollars if you're just looking

510
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,859
at the outputs on the ledger its gonna
look like i'm sending somebody five

511
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,900
dollars in somebody else's receiving 999
million nine hundred night whatever like

512
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,960
it ton of money right but they're not
armed

513
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,130
the sender problem so this is the sender
wallet

514
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,700
this is not in the block chain is not
unless there is no centerfield

515
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,210
I'm you have to derive it I'm it sucks
you have to actually derive it from by

516
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:08,310
taking the sender wallet or the
receiving wallet of the output that the

517
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:14,790
input is a previous is referencing in
its previous hash field and it sucks

518
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,850
because everything is a chain so that's
how you have to drive this whole thing

519
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,990
my coworker Kristen her wrote this giant
big bastard of a sequel query that

520
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,830
actually made all those connections
corny but I realize in retrospect I

521
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,980
probably should have used a graph
database for this I should I definitely

522
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,620
should use the graph databases this but
I didn't really realize it at the time

523
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,240
when i did that giant sequel query to
like map like link everything together

524
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,229
with my coworker did rather I'm i did I
straight didn't have enough room in my

525
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,920
machine to build like the view table for
that so I overnight at 32 gigabytes of

526
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,920
RAM to my house and put it in my
computer like it still didn't work as a

527
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,350
dumbass $200 i've ever spent my entire
life but so basically I did everything

528
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:01,740
and I just didn't myself Carolina
internet suck too much so I ended up

529
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,939
having like like my roommate ended up
taking me to his to his office that

530
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,750
gigabit fiber fiber and I like uploaded
my whole dataset compressed in that

531
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,430
uploaded to s3 and I rented this giant
AWS server that had like 300 gigabytes

532
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,600
of RAM that cost like eight dollars
every hour and I was like oh like

533
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,319
screaming and like typing everything in
because it was costing me like it's

534
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,320
eight dollars an hour like this is a go
as fast as humanly possible

535
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,790
so anyways I ended up i did it i have
been made the query I like link

536
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,330
everything together and then I just
ripped out the database and pull it back

537
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,380
and then the amount field was talking
before the amount of Bitcoin the amount

538
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,640
of Bitcoin transaction is actually in
the blockchain isn't any outputs its

539
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,290
institutions it's not in like black it's
not a Bitcoin sukoshi there's a hundred

540
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,759
million stitches to a Bitcoin that's why
you know I minutes here in the outlets

541
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,790
then the next thing which was a little
bit of the pain of a pain in the ass

542
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,350
I'm was the historical USD exchanging
like i was saying like Bitcoin the price

543
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,529
of bitcoin is not is not anywhere in the
blockchain ledger

544
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,700
it's actually going to be derived its
however much money people are willing to

545
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,919
pay for at the time that's what
determines the market value

546
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,120
I'm given i need to have a function
basically i wrote I wrote a function

547
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,620
that given in epic timestamp give me the
Bitcoin USD value get at that time

548
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,609
converted to a day trip that out of like
some data source and then yank down on

549
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,590
the market basically the historical USD
pricing data for Bitcoin blockchain not

550
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,340
info at this link so take given species
multiply that by a hundred million

551
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,170
multiply that by however much bitcoins
worth at that time and there you've got

552
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,230
and that's it everything to end up with
this big

553
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,910
ah Kristen was like a CSV and you'll see
here like all the you can't really see

554
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:48,200
it all the USD value zero because that
was in $MONTH 2009 when no one would

555
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,600
have spent anything for Bitcoin right
when he came out on this is actually

556
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,350
just the outputs Bumgarner more on my
partner source codes i get help and I

557
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:02,089
get up is the repo still private i need
to unprivate it i'm gonna do that any

558
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,930
day now I promise if you wanted in
between now and when I'm private it i'm

559
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,890
just-just email me or tweet at me or
whatever and i'll send it to you it's

560
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,720
written it's in Python 35 use Python 35
doesn't use it won't work with python 3

561
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,259
4

562
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,400
it certainly won't work in Python 27 on
it slow i tried doing multi-threading it

563
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,180
kind of works kind of didn't because i
don't actually I don't know

564
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,080
multi-threading because i'm not a good
program so that I needed to load

565
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,720
everything into a DBMS and i decided to
use something called you and click house

566
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,540
by NXT NXT the Russian search engine

567
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,360
I'm why well because one of my
co-workers recommended that I do it like

568
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,300
that I'm and he started mean he was
right

569
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,570
it's awesome to use something called
views of you like a database view is

570
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,450
basically just

571
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,770
the output of another query being
treated as a table so basically I link

572
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,040
everything together with a view output
exported it and it was basically like a

573
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,400
table that was just the output of
another more complex query the only

574
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,300
downside of quick houses that they can't
make queries that don't fit into and I

575
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:05,280
so then I had it I had about a hundred
gig plaintext csv to 13 hours to parse

576
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,369
out it took 15 minutes to load into
database

577
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:12,180
this is what putting the inputs and the
outputs look like then I don't get

578
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,868
together this is the thing that i was
talking about before this thing that I

579
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:16,650
told you about

580
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:22,859
I i actually ended up going to a friends
room my roommates office spinning up a

581
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:30,450
giant AWS server etc etc this is the
sequel query that's one query so it's

582
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,270
huge don't link everything together my
coworker Kristen I wrote that because

583
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,349
he's the man this is the output of it in
quick house so this may actually ripped

584
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,430
everything apart

585
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,980
I've got txt payee stretchy amount every
time Sam USD amount and then like a date

586
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:51,630
so I had it hadn't any database had in a
database i am going to blow through the

587
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,440
next one because I'm a little short on
time on this is what it looked like it

588
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,170
looked like 4.4 billion records

589
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:05,099
I there were so how many transactions do
you think there is ok how many

590
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,280
transactions do you think there were
that are over a million dollars a big

591
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,760
one because i have the USD value over a
million our transactions stinking yes

592
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:22,170
50,000 is insanely close 60,000 60,000
transactions over 1 million dollars 404

593
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:28,740
transactions over 10 million dollars and
I'm sorry four and 14 thank you and

594
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,919
seven transactions that were a hundred
million dollars over time picking

595
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,859
biggest US dollar transfers of all time

596
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,670
i'm at this handcrafted a little bit on
the biggest one ever was a hundred 47

597
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,569
million dollars on over 20 seconds 2013
somebody wrote an article about it was

598
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:47,520
so big in the article was literally
titled a shitload of money moves in one

599
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Bitcoin transaction that is what the
title of the article was

600
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,479
there were a hundred and forty million
dollar tree and there have been a

601
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,410
hundred forty million Bitcoin
transactions largest unredeemed Bitcoin

602
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,730
transaction this is 34 million dollar
transaction that has been unclaimed for

603
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,320
two years just sitting

604
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,160
I've got other stuff like the days the
days that the most you

605
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,670
yes that is current value

606
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,170
yep so it is now worth 34 million
dollars he was traded two years ago

607
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,160
I'm sorry

608
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,779
oh then I'll because bitcoin is about
twice as much then yeah I days where the

609
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,880
most US dollars were traded on 2,000 on
january $MONTH twenty-fourth 2016-2017

610
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,710
trillion dollars of mine were traded the
day before 11 trillion dollars a Bitcoin

611
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,710
were traded the day before or no I'm
sorry

612
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:45,100
March fifth 2016 7 trillion dollars
remove I didn't actually finish the

613
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,220
slide and i forgot to i'm sorry but i
can look at things like how much money

614
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,009
has been donated to like WikiLeaks our
baby's got a hundred twenty-five

615
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,370
thousand dollars on one of the Comets
para gate they got three thousand

616
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,100
dollars i thought that was funny at
first I was like pirate bay probably

617
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,830
would've gotten more but then i
remembered the people that go to the

618
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:05,920
pirate bay the kind of cheap so that
kind of makes sense a lot of other

619
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,730
questions a lot of other questions where
things like you know what are the

620
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,160
average amount of transactions per month
these are just different things that you

621
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,149
can ask that I haven't gotten up to
writing queries for yet

622
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,720
and finally the fuck is my 15 million
dollars big so let's go back I basically

623
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,009
wrote this big giant query that said
show me all the transactions show me the

624
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,310
biggest transactions that happened the
month favorite that was what i did

625
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,700
either were not there were no
transactions there's no one single

626
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,850
transactions that were 15 million
dollars in February I found in eight

627
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:41,080
million dollar transaction that happened
four days before the tweet and it

628
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,830
actually looks like it went into a
tumblr the day that merge probably sent

629
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,069
the to tweet to con us

630
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm but I I mean I think I don't know
that it has anything to do with and i

631
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,120
just--that's just the closest thing that
I could find was worth a trillion

632
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:01,089
dollars at the top right this is it like
being ripped apart being split in half

633
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,180
like a bunch of a bunch of times I mean
going into a lot and then it continues

634
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,440
to do that if you actually got this

635
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,619
action on if you guys wanna check this
transaction down highly recommended just

636
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:11,230
click through and make your own
decisions and it's and it's in the

637
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,190
basement thing what if the transaction
split into multiple small transactions

638
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,089
right

639
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:20,529
what if the guy was tricked into sending
is Bitcoin in 10 different transactions

640
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,170
I'm so show me the wallets that received
the most money total in the month of

641
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,310
federal right

642
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,750
oh I've got one minute I didn't find any
all of the ones that i found were

643
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,510
basically they're all high cash flow
wallets that were that had money coming

644
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,099
in money going out for a year or so so I
don't think any of this i did find 12

645
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,940
million our transaction two days after
the tweet which was here I mean it was

646
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,319
claimed how about five months later our
future work i want to open public

647
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,029
website blog build a front-end make my
partner code suck last i watch everyone

648
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,079
like watch what people do with donation
money build an API film learning engine

649
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,589
blah law enforcement to use this
intelligence community to use this in

650
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:06,099
txt use this there there's anti-money
laundering use cases

651
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:10,960
I'm investment use cases for hedge funds
there's some evil uses in here can use

652
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,670
it as starting platform fine

653
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,640
rich people and steal their money
evaluate people's privacy and now

654
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,790
watching is cool but it's not formatted
to make queries like we want to so we

655
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,359
ripped apart putting a database asset
question and it was awesome

656
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,799
did anybody move 15 million dollars
around the time tweet not one

657
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,420
transaction I saw a couple things that
were kind of close but maybe my timing

658
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:34,780
is off

659
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,030
I don't know might be analyzing the
blockchain by doing this because

660
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,839
somebody ask me that at some point my
answer is no good because if you use

661
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:45,790
that logic google D&I blockchain by
creating a search engine or denied the

662
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,630
internet by creating search engine so
that bullshit database can do whatever

663
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,319
you want to you can make sequel queries
against it answers questions correlate

664
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,640
price bitcoin with other stuff that's it
that's it that's my talk

665
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,640
does anybody have any questions yes

666
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:09,299
the question is do I have any plans to
do with other cryptocurrencies like

667
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,589
litecoin etc

668
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:14,160
um I don't have any plans to do it would
be insanely easy to do because really

669
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,160
the only thing that differentiates most
of those cryptocurrencies they use a

670
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,368
different network identified like Dave
their own thing and they have a

671
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:24,300
different network identifier in the in
the in the protocol it would be the

672
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,200
exactly be probably almost the exact
same thing with minimal tweaks but now I

673
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,200
haven't done that yet but you can

674
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:40,259
yep yes the question is any interesting
doing this side chains or private chains

675
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,000
on I don't actually know anything about
either of those um i would think a

676
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,940
private private chains have trusted
third parties though don't they they're

677
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,940
like hosted by like multiple the people

678
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,890
yeah private armed I don't but that's
just because i really don't know

679
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,000
anything about this

680
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,119
I'm open to it go any other questions

681
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:07,619
nope arm the that's it that's my talk
and is my contact info

682
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,549
thank you guys for coming to my talk
