1
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,750
thank you so today we will talk about
instant response awakens and we're going

2
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,060
to talk about common problems that I our
team's face and we're also going to talk

3
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,610
about the actions that our group took to
deal with these how many people is runs

4
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,500
runs a sock manages socks is an analyst
has anything to do with any of that

5
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,740
okay great so we got a good bit of
people here so about me so I started off

6
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,550
working in state law enforcement did
that for five years and got bored with

7
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,330
that so i decided to go to university
where there's lots and lots of incident

8
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,170
so it's a lot of fun i love it have been
there for 11 years I've done everything

9
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,270
from just being a general I our guide to
security architect for the University

10
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,530
and now I manage our sock and on the
tier 3 analysts when when I need to be

11
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,530
us again storm center handler for three
years and mcse number 76

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,110
so what is our environment look like and
what we have some of these challenges so

13
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,209
we have approximately forty-two thousand
people enrolled on 18,000 faculty/staff

14
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:08,060
eight campuses distributed throughout
the state and we have distributed IT

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,900
everywhere we have departments that have
their own IT we have some departments of

16
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,270
the department that have their own IT we
have 10 to 12 active directories we have

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,140
different exchange servers everywhere
and we only managed centrally about a

18
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,619
3000 desktops so everybody else has
either completely unmanaged are managed

19
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,129
by different people so it's it's quite
interesting and fun trying to secure

20
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:36,230
this type of environment so what are the
challenges that typically everybody runs

21
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,970
into right staff and we all have
staffing problems slow response time so

22
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,560
from the time and alert or alarm
generates how quickly are we picking it

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,560
up slow time to collect the slow
analysis and distributed environment how

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,360
do we get tools and things in place to
help us speed these things up and then a

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,750
lot of times who responded stuff when we
really should have but we didn't know

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,630
until we start digging into it so we
have an opportunity for change

27
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,179
there is a department of revenue breach
at the end of 20 2012

28
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,810
and as more and more came out about it

29
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,400
legislature was really upset about it
and we saw the writing on the wall for

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,640
new statutes come down to make us
require and we already have several

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,388
things in place that we wanted to get
done and we use this opportunity to say

32
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:33,219
hey now is a great time before these
laws coming to place to start putting

33
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:39,340
this in effect and so we had a two-year
project implemented a lot of new

34
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,510
technologies the first thing we did was
implemented assuming full packet capture

35
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,388
we also had a remote instant response
tool and we implemented a discovery

36
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:56,469
system and then to help kind of bring it
all in and allow us to get these things

37
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,668
install we had we develop some minimal
security standards where everybody on

38
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,290
campus is supposed to have our data
discovery tool install and then systems

39
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,060
that have sensitive data have to have
our remote instant response to install

40
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:19,030
the new staff we were fortunate enough
to be able to double our staff we added

41
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,520
two more incident response people so we
have now just a 5 we have we have two

42
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,669
more GRC people and steph three and then
we had a public relations person so that

43
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,030
helped a lot because as a university
they wanted to do a lot of outreach to

44
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,210
the community and it was just too much
for us to manage that within ourselves

45
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,810
that we added a public relations
department person to help us go through

46
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,530
and do these type of things so we have
had all these people now how are we

47
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,609
going to get them trained up to be
useful right it's very hard to get

48
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,630
someone that already has security
experience so what we do is we do a lot

49
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,190
of sales training we bring a lot of
product training to to get them up on

50
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,210
products then we do individually within
our group text talks so things that

51
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,669
other people are familiar with will will
have a bi-monthly meeting where they'll

52
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,210
go through and say hey I figured out
this tool and let's implement it and

53
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,380
then mentoring and this is really
important for our group normally how we

54
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,800
do it is well we have all this you know
standard operating procedures and we'll

55
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,980
sit people

56
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,400
we'll show them how to do it and then
we'll give them the chance to go through

57
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,909
it and then as we're sitting there and
watching them were always asking these

58
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,280
questions why are we doing this this way

59
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,119
why wouldn't we do it this way what
makes sense you know and always

60
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,800
challenging them to make sure they
understand the process and challenging

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,560
them to hey if you see an improvement
let's make it and it takes us about 18

62
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,890
months to have somebody completely
self-reliant where I don't feel like

63
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,340
they're coming in every day asking me
questions about how how do i do this how

64
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:00,349
do i do that so it's a long process so
for slow response time

65
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,590
the first thing we did was add assume
and we got more eyes on glass it is it's

66
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,539
just what we needed and we also have
automated privatization based upon where

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,420
the people are at different apartments
and what kind of data is on their

68
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,480
systems there are obviously the things
that we go first so here you can see on

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,610
so 20 beginning of $MONTH 2014 to the
end of $MONTH 2014 is where we

70
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,730
implemented our sim and then we got more
people so it's pretty dramatic change

71
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,350
from you 2013 is taking his 29 days on
average from the Lord to come up for

72
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,750
somebody goes to entry object and then
by the next year we're now down to five

73
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,730
days from the time an alarm comes up so
just from the sheer fact of us adding

74
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,590
more people and prioritization and
having assume it was a pretty dramatic

75
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,989
change in that last couple years it's it
slowly decreased but not dramatically so

76
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,280
we can pretty easily

77
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,010
a tribute to just getting more people in
and adding some better log monitoring 22

78
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:11,780
this direct change so slow analysis
right it's always tough you're going

79
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,000
through and you know you want to get
faster and closing their the through the

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,660
instance that you're working and so
things that we did was one thing is we

81
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,310
will change how we're analyzing already
post back and storm center last month

82
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:31,970
about prioritizing incidents and where
to get the data so for example the the

83
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,250
top one up here is for fishing

84
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,030
so if

85
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,960
we have a fishing incident the primary
piece for primary in this case we would

86
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,359
look in our bro

87
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,910
verlox's are awesome full packet capture
and smtp large right and so there we

88
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,030
have lots of other things we could be
looking at but to answer the questions

89
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,750
we want to answer these are the primary
things to look at and so to help guide

90
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,100
our people through the most efficient
process not there you're not smart

91
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,130
enough to use these other means but
these this is the most efficient way to

92
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,250
get the answers that we're looking for
and so we've mapped all these out in

93
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,520
each one of these how to use bro how to
do these are all that are part of

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,570
standard operating procedures but it
seemed like and I'm guilty of this too

95
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,690
we find something we're really
interested in and we jumped down the

96
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,340
rabbit hole which is fun and cool but it
wasn't necessarily where we needed to be

97
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:28,549
in the analysis process has been very
helpful for us other thing is you know

98
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,190
just across the industry this has been
happening is reduced the number of

99
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,049
holdings collections that we're doing
mostly due to insurance Ponce tool we

100
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,709
can remotely grab whatever you need to
grab memory timelines all that kind of

101
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,630
stuff remotely there's no reason for us
to grab the whole disk now when we do

102
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,900
now it's mostly for compliance reasons
HR reasons legal criminal investigations

103
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,430
are if we have a confirmed loss will
make sure we grab a hope is so with us

104
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,910
collecting less data we can and last up
much faster and also full packet capture

105
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,500
is awesome if you guys don't have full
packet capture I feel for you I used to

106
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,270
be there we would have a snort alert and
like all right i got 1 packet and then I

107
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:16,550
have flows and I'm like what happened
you know and so now you have to normally

108
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,219
get on disk start seeing really what
happened

109
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,630
RR make some educated guesses if you're
fortunate to have bro installed maybe

110
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,100
you have a good idea what happened but
without that it can be difficult and

111
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,480
with full packet capture lot of times we
can see the guy talk about to C&C and

112
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,500
cnc was already down by the time he
talked out so we're safe alright so this

113
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,950
those kind of inferences can
dramatically speed up our analysis

114
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:47,900
process so uh this goes through our
total investigations are down at the

115
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,620
bottom is the

116
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,310
they're so in 2013 these are actual
investigations these aren't incident

117
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,020
alarms this is people collecting data
analyzing it seeing it the incidence

118
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,840
confirmed or not so in 2013 we had a
hundred and three incidents we

119
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,440
investigated and we had 741 hours spent
on Windows the next year 2014 you see a

120
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,390
pretty big dip and that's why are there
during this process we were installing

121
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,540
all these technologies that were talking
about today so we're doing a lot more

122
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,680
engineering less responding and so
that's why that number went down so

123
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,329
2013-2015 is pretty good comparison you
see the the uptick right you're going

124
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,980
wow what why what was this and the
reason partly is we had a couple of big

125
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,950
incidents where we had 15 to 20 systems
compromised all at the same time so that

126
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,770
was a little more complicated for our
guys and plus we're doing a lot of

127
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,400
mentoring so each time one incident
where mentoring we've got two people

128
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,060
working the same incident so we're
getting double time but as you can see

129
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,709
this year we've got with other guys in
place for several years were able to

130
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,180
process many more investigations with a
lot less time and this is up to the

131
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:04,069
beginning of august here you can tell
from this is a better graft really you

132
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,910
can see as our people get more familiar
with our incident process and learning

133
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,050
and thus improving our processes and
using the tools more efficiently that

134
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,469
we're now able to get an average
investigation down to about two hours

135
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,580
this is on time this is a closing time
we'll talk about that next but actually

136
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,150
when they're looking at it they can look
and analyze the data and determine if

137
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:30,890
the internets happen and proceed on
within two hours so this is a fun when

138
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,470
we actually didn't collect this metric
at the time this is time from data

139
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,330
collection to analysis so we get an
alarm and I have an IP address

140
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,750
now the problem is is where is that
computer on a large University Network

141
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:54,980
this is a major major problem we have a
own and this is a guesstimation it's

142
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,310
about two and a half days on average
before we had our iron tool

143
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,920
and the process goes like this we we
hopefully we hope that it's in the IP

144
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,939
spreadsheet so we have a list of
networks and who's the manager there's

145
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,820
networks it's very inaccurate people are
always you know starting and leaving and

146
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,200
so it's very inaccurate then we have to
check logs hopefully they log into a

147
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,860
next segment that we have
username/password all that good stuff on

148
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,270
for them if not we'll check DCP and
hopefully their computer name is you

149
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,250
know something that we can recognize
it's not

150
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,980
student 1 and then if not we can map it
and hopefully we can log into it to be

151
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,170
RTP and see what the username is if that
doesn't work right so we've already

152
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,010
spent 45 minutes trying to try this
system down we have to block it because

153
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,160
our block and hopefully somebody's going
to scream say hey I can't get on the

154
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,469
internet what's wrong

155
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:56,610
so it's very very complicated in the
problem was is as soon as somebody gets

156
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,160
wind of our systems compromised

157
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,990
now you have the possibility of them
running AV are like you want to say hey

158
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,930
I found it and we delete it right and
maybe stopped all over your

159
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,819
investigation and this was a very very
common so now with our instant response

160
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,040
to a pre deployed we don't even tell
them about it until we can confirm that

161
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,540
the incident happened

162
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,050
it's just so much easier now we don't
we're not deployed everywhere I wish we

163
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,329
were and we still have to go back to the
old analysis method when we do but

164
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,920
average day too close so these are this
is based on 24-hour day not a 12-8 hour

165
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,689
workday or anything like that so in 2013
and took us an average of ten days to

166
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:42,000
close an incident and as we really got
the instant response to deployed

167
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,420
mid-2014 ish so you can see from four
and a half days on down to help how

168
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,650
quickly we can now close an incident so
it's about four-and-a-half hours so the

169
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,150
difference is it's about 22 hours on
average for us to analyze and so it's

170
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,600
about two hours first to go out with
instant response tool click what we need

171
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
and analyzing

172
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,609
so distributed environment are testing a
lot of this policy for requirements of

173
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,830
centrally manage tools it's very very
difficult to to get such a distributed

174
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,000
environment all working on the same
thing when there's no way to deploy

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,410
tools with a single tool it's very
difficult and so you have to meet with

176
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,839
the Dean's apartment head

177
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,400
we have them do a self-service a
questionnaire every year and then we

178
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,850
talked to the Dean sing you know if this
is what we expect this is where you guys

179
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,960
are at you know what should be the next
steps and then the other thing is just

180
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,580
to get general acceptance are the tools
have to be very easy to manage and self

181
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,920
update because a lot of the lot of small
departments have no way to push push

182
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,060
them so they are still sneaker and
adding things around so if we can't have

183
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,290
an automatic update tool with very
little overhead it's very hard for us to

184
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:03,490
to get people to install the stuff so
this is probably the most important time

185
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,710
saver and again it's hard to quantify
this is unnecessary responses so

186
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,839
previously what we'd have to do was if
we saw system was compromised we would

187
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,190
ask the ad man are the user page you
have sensitive data on the system and

188
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,060
ninety-nine percent of the time what do
they say no way right well in about 75%

189
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,250
of cases they did you know almost always
when we went and collected and did that

190
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,470
they had some kind of sensitive data

191
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,230
well now with us having the data
discovery tool on all these system we

192
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,790
can quickly look is ok this system you
know it doesn't have any sensitive data

193
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,860
it's not a critical asset as commodity
malware we simply just gonna knock it

194
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,020
off the internet and tell them to wipe
it and so this the sheer untold hours of

195
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,360
us not having to go through every
compromise that we had on campus has

196
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:06,010
saved this untold untold hours it's been
a huge huge asset for us so key

197
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,589
takeaways start gathering metrics now so
if you aren't gathering good metrics

198
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:17,200
it's going to make it much more
difficult for you and your group to make

199
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,060
cases

200
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,959
or for buying things we already had
plans when we had this incident we

201
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,220
already have plans in place of what we
wanted to do to reduce our metrics that

202
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,430
we already had also it makes it a great
case for you you talk to the CIO and

203
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,239
he's you know he sees what's taking you
guys five days to working alarm

204
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,390
let's get that down you already have
that plan in place and you can hand it

205
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:45,360
over immediately many times previously
to the DOR breeze we had we already had

206
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,450
these written up and literally every
time we'd have incident we've changed

207
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,440
the date and put that same request in
front of people and they would just keep

208
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,790
seeing it over and over and you know
eventually they got it that they needed

209
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,969
to do this and it may be the first time
it was somebody they didn't care about

210
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,430
maybe you know it it took a vp getting
compromised and and he's yelling at the

211
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:13,260
CIO going on what's going on for him to
do this and start on start listening so

212
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,349
don't give up you know and and make sure
you have your plan and where your

213
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,069
metrics are and what you want to do and
it just makes it easier business case

214
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,730
for you

215
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,380
um staff retention is always a problem
you know training making sure that you

216
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,340
know you're investing in these guys and
that you know you care about him i have

217
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,179
a progression path for them even if you
might not be able to give them a bump

218
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,420
there's still always the hey we're
working on this process

219
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,410
don't give up and then quality alive
university south carolina we have a

220
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,980
great working environment we're very
flexible when I don't call a whole lot

221
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,390
when things happen so it's a it's it's
very nice to manage the stock and not

222
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:54,510
get called to the morning every day so
um what had the most impact that's the

223
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,590
question I get a lot out all the tools
if I had to get one so we already had a

224
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,889
lot of other tools in place so don't
think if you only had one tool this

225
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,970
would be the one but in this case the
data discovery tool saving so much time

226
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,010
I'm not analyzing systems that would be
my first choice that would dramatically

227
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:17,490
reduce how how many incidents we worked
the second insane . forensics and in our

228
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,240
cases begin our distribute environment
this saves us a lot of time being going

229
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,010
out immediately to reach in and collect
stuff full packet capture again a huge

230
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,890
time saver when you're looking at
network traffic and

231
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,750
then the same last we already had seemed
like we had security onion deployed and

232
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,600
so we already had a lot of some type
features and it wasn't that big of a

233
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,800
deal as some of the other stuff so again
so what do we have next we want another

234
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,030
additional position to manage systems so
we already have that pd written and

235
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,510
where you know trying to work on that
process so the next time somebody asks

236
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,710
again why is it down to five days well
have you know our team is all splitting

237
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,100
up our time managing some of these
systems we need a dedicated person to

238
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,179
manage the systems and then we can
perform or I our processes automated

239
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,720
quarantine that's just us doing some API
scripting for instant response so we can

240
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,920
go out there and Quarantine so again
that will reduce our time respond do

241
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,310
more threat hunting on campus and then
just a better use of our threat Intel to

242
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:23,280
respond stuff faster and make better
priority changes when especially thank

243
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,730
our my sock guys are cio James Perry and
the rest of our team without all their

244
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,730
hard work we wouldn't be able to have
these awesome numbers to show people

245
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,790
questions

246
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:44,550
these are all tweet out these slides
will probably be on my github so yes sir

247
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:51,570
is very bothered more about outbursts
like what exactly

248
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,540
hell yeah so it dlp you know most people
say dlp right so you're familiar for

249
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,470
that we're scanning for sensitive data
SN make account number into those type

250
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,030
of things are you know the the number
one or didn't find her and then mcafee

251
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,440
has her own dlp we are using the
prevention portion because at a

252
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,060
university I would pull my hair out
right but the the important thing in

253
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,419
front from our perspective at this point
is that people be able to know what date

254
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,070
is on their system and then be able to
remediate it that's our main goal is for

255
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,159
them to actually remove the data but if
they have we have reporting and then

256
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,900
they have other requirements they have
to me like for example if you put in you

257
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,169
configure the regular

258
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:38,470
reference from you like certain social
security number yes yes absolutely yes

259
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,799
that's what it does it'll crawl crawl
the different files knows how partisan

260
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,609
does a regex expressions for foreign
credit card bank account numbers and how

261
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:50,320
you set it up most of them now have a
huge predefined library for HIPAA and

262
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,830
all that kind of stuff and you just turn
this on and have it scheduled to scan

263
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:03,549
either and weekly monthly whatever basis
you feel like a necessary mr. and mrs.

264
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:10,330
where it's not very lot of interest to
your team so you recycle time maybe

265
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,489
you'll get off as a wife that system
partner any artifacts like those systems

266
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:22,749
so that later determined something
additional so the question was did

267
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,249
everybody hear the question

268
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,509
sometimes we do sometimes we don't

269
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:32,619
it really depends on how commodity it is
if it's something that we see all the

270
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,619
time know if it's something new in our
environment generally we will and we

271
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,330
have feed our IOC's into our ticketing
system and then though that gets

272
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,590
propagated into our instant response
tools and those type of things but but

273
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:57,970
not always its outs a different time we
do question can you put a dollar in 18

274
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,230
months to train

275
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:09,909
yes yes well it depends on um yeah so i
would say we generally would do at least

276
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:19,359
two scenes classes so you're roughly you
know 6000 per that and then at least 22

277
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:26,649
other training classes so maybe 10 to
12,000 potentially time's up

278
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:31,658
do we want to ok thank you guys feel
