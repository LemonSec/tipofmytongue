1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
robertson is special you want you

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:20,279
yeah exactly so he's not rob pressure
thanks

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,970
digna just a little bit about me and
been in south carolina since 2006 I've

4
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,369
done 26 years of military peace my work
for Poundstone services which is this

5
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,250
upset unit inside mcafee where you feel
security also work in the South Carolina

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,989
army national guard and you see a bunch
of my guys here running around shirts on

7
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,459
but they're all over there and he has
probably one of the few people on the

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,870
basic plan that still actually have an
active yahoo account to have to

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,419
transition to going so unfortunately
that's one of those faces what we're

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,229
going to talk about today is a threat
intelligence perspective of what you

11
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,030
guys normally do villages when I see in
the industry for being part of the

12
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,540
services see what's going on to protect
her and from what I've learned from

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,990
we're going to cover is where what's
held where we now what are we doing and

14
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,548
then threw the pieces of why is there a
parallel universe things that we already

15
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,930
on my all because a lot of things that
we get all these things we get to play

16
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,759
with it and one of the things we don't
understand is it there's a methodology

17
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,299
finding maggots hunting isn't new right
hunting has been going on since the

18
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,880
existence of man and the reality is that
this new sexy things we talked about

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,970
hunting what is intelligence right well
what your intelligence is now present

20
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:01,170
day is exactly mrs. Doubtfire right it's
a frog it's a mistake because the

21
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,240
reality of threat intelligence right
it's not hunting he is right

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,758
intelligence it's not political

23
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,579
it's not indicators of haha numbers
engineering is 90

24
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:19,180
these things is not react it's a process
right it's sexy sort of maybe maybe not

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,360
right for the requirement and have
proactiveness outside intelligence is

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,610
what the right and there's three release
distinct levels a military perspective

27
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,910
that all transition to leadership
remember just want to have your

28
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,160
intelligence they want to know what's
happening at work but I was it affect my

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,790
performance 3 23 years soft already want
to know what operationally

30
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,410
decision-making what do you think we're
rolling now where my tactical right we

31
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,690
have a process for analysis right
analysis what we talked about machine

32
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,590
learning threat intelligence is a
part-machine party because it's a

33
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,360
process in order to derive difference
right and those that's why machine

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,019
learning and AI all of us because it
lose you but the reality is when you

35
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,620
look at when Rock says you know what

36
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,700
see I don't really deal with a nice

37
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:33,040
yes because it's too much of the
experience the best is the 12 years

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,390
right

39
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:42,670
All Hands to do the best i have to bring
in the process to look about the problem

40
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,500
and start to build those products for
tvs start to look at the ends right the

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,880
siggins mass in the oceans open source
intelligence signal intelligence

42
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,790
measures intelligence geo intelligence
imagery intelligence all these things

43
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,590
are cold the military space but when
they get to meet mostly right now open

44
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,989
source intelligence is key because they
actors in your space they want to

45
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,820
advertise they want to talk about the
stuff that they got right that's their

46
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,410
motivation right

47
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,769
ransomware motivated by greed right i
want to make so we've got to understand

48
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,919
the shared operational picture either
whether it's

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,350
actually in our country and our region
worth even lower our personal not

50
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,790
business with the threats to financial
institution and the threats to the

51
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,430
industrial control system different
space so for you have to sit here and

52
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,980
stare at this one picture so for the
ladies out there

53
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:52,360
here's something right Billy how yeah a
real show up here is predominantly male

54
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,740
environment right imagine we really have
to understand this this is for everybody

55
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,860
this is ready to share situational
awareness for everybody

56
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,390
one of the things that you'll hear you
following twitter is it free the data

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:15,669
right because data from my computer from
fire from silence from outside the one

58
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,830
thing about PTI that makes it awesome

59
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,120
they're free the day maybe everybody
puts in a piece to play e to be able to

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,480
compete in the same level because we can
talk about later down the road

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,710
integrated adaptive cyber defense is an
option and it's something you have so

62
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,020
talking about this parallel universe and
creating your thoughts of your own

63
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,919
reality

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,900
one of the things that i love about
christmas talk to the waitress is going

65
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,940
with psychology is a lot of people tell
me that well this is my reality this is

66
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,250
how I see you don't understand my
breasts exactly cruise because

67
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,090
perception is your reality and that's
really the problem

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,670
great for the solution because every
organization runs that reality there on

69
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,980
way you're willing to the needles when
you're talking about all universes we

70
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,800
terrorism sacrifices something is

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,840
for the last few years along how to
introduce the operators those of you

72
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:34,409
that were the asian medical we're all
living space now the same problem solved

73
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:44,610
ball and always find advantage of going
around you it really that question is

74
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:59,610
how do whatever we learn their social
and all right okay what would you say

75
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,669
hands slowly over over over

76
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,280
most people will get ready too much
understand that when they start seeing

77
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,039
press there we you're in the middle east
watched it off the middle eat first then

78
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:35,340
rose they want to resume so you can you
write this is gonna work so we can talk

79
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,989
about it t one of the things that I
brought my team that may be kind of

80
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,690
weird is that the analyst and operators
doesn't really see I military decided

81
00:07:45,690 --> 00:08:02,879
everything to see old do it without
always responds all we did was I so

82
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,210
here's walk all over everything

83
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:22,710
because I didn't do that is so as with
all the next few years the things that

84
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,849
we did I only helped with other
operators that i've been i've been on

85
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:41,130
your own career and in my life what he
said let's pause there i got one rubber

86
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,939
ducky

87
00:08:41,940 --> 00:09:13,440
can somebody tell me more dominant army
regular that ball bag mom a lot and

88
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:32,310
special forces in teams because i was
also on the radio and a great for you

89
00:09:32,310 --> 00:10:04,170
one lot playing space you have and you
have so Bri e303 on with you like route

90
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:30,660
/ natalie how is it but I go out all
create that they need the capability of

91
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,870
force protection needed a different
skill set

92
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:41,160
now the cool thing about either one they
all do similar riches able to separate

93
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,939
those two mission says maybe them
epically cool when they were better

94
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,640
right when you look at how did love
taking down and how that process works

95
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,010
who was doing what when you look at
Black Hawk Down was pulling the security

96
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,529
so that the other guys going to do what
they need to do you use that we work

97
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,430
together is it is how we organize those
teams and that's not happening

98
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,810
so one of the things that we talked
about an obstetrician and dynamic is it

99
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:19,109
there has to be what right there's a
give-and-take this process there's a

100
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,670
relationship between animals and the
operators the guys are actually running

101
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,349
this the systems are actually trying to
go out salt proper security problems

102
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,350
going out her hand held information
relevant to their situation Mike just

103
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,980
came to give them an ideal hash and a
domain and expect them to solve world

104
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,550
hunger

105
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,029
it's not gonna happen they're not going
to fix you that wrong

106
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,130
they're not gonna be predictive they're
not going to be able to draw do you have

107
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,420
their own internal reconnaissance so
that they see things a little bit for

108
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,410
great but who drives the reconnaissance
process is it just died are worse than

109
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,420
the analyst looking at the train and
trying to figure out how that works

110
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,640
right just one of the talk to you last
shameless lovely doing classes

111
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,939
intelligence is intelligence preparation
about which is basically what everyone

112
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:22,319
does not currently in this process when
you run arrived you mind trying to find

113
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:27,780
Andy training in extra training process
what is important like in roskie what's

114
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,959
important in the ICS I don't want to be
a two and then I just go work from that

115
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:41,849
dream and I family security capabilities
you like finding a community-driven

116
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:50,579
different these military little apply
your operations and you should apply in

117
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,859
defending your networks because it is
anybody protected all the things that

118
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:04,890
many guys solution text all the users
all the yeah I I you break the reality

119
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,530
is you have to be something the risk of
somebody's be optimized made the

120
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,870
question is what you want right

121
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,980
how can you drive he adds and procedures
that are actually hurry

122
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,949
how do you build those skills and
abilities and waited we're right who has

123
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:29,310
the authority to act when they need so
what that fundamentally leads to

124
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,959
improvise what all right patterns
associations and awareness and

125
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,520
prediction keeping those something that
analysis supposed to do their supposed

126
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,490
to study the threat they only players
when they do that process something only

127
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,390
threat then they can give you the
capability to understand what's really

128
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,650
going on they'll build a development
over time you talked to like all

129
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,569
medicines where they know what they're
doing because they're seeing every day

130
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,570
how that cybercrime environment is
fucking him and how their transition a

131
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,470
different tool sets are using different
capabilities are coming into different

132
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,730
angles are doing different check these
all of the other all residents of trying

133
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:18,120
to make some money trading motivated
operators are really about surprise

134
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,690
decision what our constants what kind of
feedback mechanism from their analysis

135
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,920
feedback analyst process and helps them
go to find more baskets right and then

136
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:40,229
the preventive process global warming
and protection so as we we come into a

137
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,360
process this is what i'll share with you
the message methodology from the Special

138
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:54,960
Forces f3e has been cleaned in different
pieces and commercial optiv is using a

139
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,210
couple of other companies are using an
office because 1100 and open-source over

140
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:06,570
here and get people that are actually
talking about f3e which is fine face

141
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,300
finish and eyes slowly

142
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:23,339
sunny what I is that has already won and
I was 13 that how serious a great talk

143
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:35,760
about air forces model for the google
with a server right this is a soft side

144
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:47,069
litter assess what I want you to see

145
00:15:48,460 --> 00:16:29,260
I write out my eye for design do not
hold up my back there on old call

146
00:16:29,260 --> 00:17:02,110
everyone all still together like that so
i will give a lot pick for the best user

147
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:09,880
knows what that close

148
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:24,400
Wow back here

149
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:39,490
all contents e-way what do you all right
is

150
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:51,220
reality of the situation really matters
how you perceive it

151
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,520
so when you look at and you're trying to
find the bad guys you've got to

152
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,780
understand the context of that
environment find it right you gotta go

153
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,350
after those high value and
identifications and then focus your

154
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,939
sensors and locate the enemy where you
want to find right and then fixate on

155
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,940
once you go to the fixation process
you're going to try and maintain and

156
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,680
track on them right

157
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,100
whether you're doing in an open source
and you're tracking a campaign from

158
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,870
multiple vendors multiple capabilities
you're working with proof . or some

159
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:29,860
other product vendors providing you
extended or what enhanced threat

160
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,610
intelligence capabilities you want to be
able to track the program's just really

161
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:39,100
attackers are really on for motivation
cycles and that's really the key like

162
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,939
the first one nation states want to keep
slow low and slow they want to be able

163
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,700
for you not see them until they're ready
for you to see them right

164
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,560
cybercrime is all about the money i got
a big money right activists they want to

165
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,600
demand that you do something that that
forwards their costs script kiddies want

166
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,830
notoriety when you look at the
motivation and you can reduce your risk

167
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,120
of motivation then you could move to a
finish right and you can contain and

168
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,919
eradicate that capability to reduce your
risk right and then you can refocus your

169
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,050
scent sensors to go even smaller but you
have to be able to look at it from that

170
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,000
perspective and that's when you start to
deliver up security model or security

171
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,070
capability to meet you there and then
exploit use what you learn and share

172
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,960
that picture target their actions look
at exploitation share that with other

173
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,400
people so that when you disseminate
everybody learns on the same process

174
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,590
dissemination have internally and
externally start small and grow bit you

175
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,449
get to what we can manage all of this
but you if you don't care about what's

176
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,190
important when we talk about . the
preparation of outfield

177
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,940
you have to focus on the key tree you
have to focus on the things that are

178
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,620
important that make that mission run so
look at your business and what makes

179
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,729
your business run a prime example is a
lot of people want to protect the web

180
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,630
servers i want it and I'm gonna be on
David a little bit you want to protect

181
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,380
the web server right that's great that's
awesome but where's the data

182
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,190
where's this stuff that after wants it's
not on the website that's indicated its

183
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:28,070
so maybe you . at the database and you
do those controls their so as we're

184
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,020
moving forward one of my hands integrate
orchestrate want to enhance the

185
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,250
information that we're looking at one
integrate all of our information across

186
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,560
start our systems and then orchestrate
our response mechanisms right want to

187
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,970
use those many pots in the sandbox to
forward the information of the

188
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,970
indicators that they find two other
security devices

189
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,680
this is the essence of integrated
adaptive cyberdefense johns hopkins did

190
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,000
through with the several toolsets the
radio industry right down that you can

191
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,150
do this best-of-breed and that's great
you can do with a single with a few

192
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,980
single lenders it just depends on how
you want to go about the process but if

193
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,840
you can't orchestrate these processes
you're not going to get fishing ideas

194
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,610
spending more time and energy on the
systems that they're keeping available

195
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,770
then they're doing to prevent the
system's it's half the team running to

196
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:30,139
secure their is keep it running on a
day-to-day basis so my challenge to you

197
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:36,260
is only the strong will survive you know
wax on wax off right you got a rich

198
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,270
lather repeat some of the best security
operators I know take it out of the

199
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:46,580
shower regular basis because they keep
doing the bases right here in this lab

200
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,189
keep doing it over and over need to know
how tall you are to be able to ride this

201
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,679
ride

202
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,809
it is a maturity process right start
small or big good at what you're doing

203
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:03,480
focus on automating the the response
mechanisms range of water is a

204
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,330
particular type of rat learn how to
video in your environment shrink the

205
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:16,799
availability to respond right this is
more about the process and technology

206
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:29,730
more processes those processes when used
with technology may have that many more

207
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,080
people affected with technology is where
we're going that's why machine learning

208
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,299
is there so in my last thing the last
thing I want to carry with you

209
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:44,610
we're doing Mike drop pretty much about
time huh what matters and automating

210
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,399
everything else if you can take it away

211
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,018
here's my twitter handle all of me you
choose if not you can happily happily

212
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,950
like my crew back here at the money so
far

213
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,749
thank you appreciate it
