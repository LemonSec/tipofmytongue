whole ground Rises happy clean i think

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,269
we have more than one constant in terms
of agreement that it was something like

7
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:38,040
the clock we got ok and 345 you have to
clean by then all right brother take the

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,660
train to go to 5 38 42 is the first to
me

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:51,480
538 or two and that was a first pick of
the various file enjoy 534 jus next was

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:03,059
one of the tactical tailor backpacks and
that was 96 559 6965 596 the next I

11
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,649
think critical one the hak5 field kits

the last talked as one of those hak5
land the mandrels and in overtime as

13
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,880

with the rendition inverse actual

20
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,200
monsters today he followed him on
twitter you can also call it there

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,089

killer's name is actually her room too

22
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,720
so we appreciate your support Jake and
we appreciate the transition support of

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,970
the size of esta Michael here is a
security consultant is going to be cool

24
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,800
self that why don't you wish i'm sure
you do is good integration as hearing

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,230
the vulnerability assessments he's going
to talk to us today of about the top of

26
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,230
someone like that so I give you move my
legs

27
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:00,840
so basically the talk of the title is
YouTube can defend against millions

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,090
cyberattacks so you know looking for
things for the presentation I thought

29
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,060
dr. you work well with the word millions
of them in there so my name is michael

30
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,370
banks and again I'm going security
consultant ever edition and we'll set

31
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,510
and also all throughout the
presentations and you want that thing's

32
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,519
a picture of the presentation and suites
and condition said they're giving away

33
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,280
free itunes gift card so you do that
throughout the toggle between that

34
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,860
tradition set i'm also sing on reserve
for so long i do that as well and I'm a

35
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,790
recent graduate of this university right
here so standard disclaimers you know

36
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,429
beans are my own and not of any of my
employers I'm not a lawyer and this is

37
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,600
definitely not legal advice so overviews
basically go background how I have to

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,049
you know do this talk and some of the
things that motivated me to do this

39
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:11,450
can go over some members be amazingly
some project started started doing and

40
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:19,548
meticulous so I was sitting in Baltimore
and I don't watch the news too much to

41
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,919
keep you know update on the current
stuff that's going on by the time there

42
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,020
was this thing that happened in the news
and they mentioned something known as an

43
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,960
SF for these days standard for any
settings set formatting 6l like that

44
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,320
sounds familiar did something like that
i had won something like that and

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,260
basically doing is a big stack of papers
with a lot of information on it and

46
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,250
you'll know about it just google it
you'll find plenty information line but

47
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:57,260
for relations hacked and dazing to house
a bunch of SF 86 is so I was not my

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:04,039
intentions play on TV and I looked into
it and don't think i've found is there's

49
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,510
a lot of hearings when government
agencies that wasn't hacked there's a

50
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,760
lot of experience that Congress has so
lovely the hearings happening in a

51
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:22,640
couple of days i got the hearing and
actually the director mr. Marshall I was

52
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,610
on was going through the hearing and you
know one of the clothes that you mention

53
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:36,110
is up there you know they worked 10
million intense all crossing that they

54
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,030
know protecting it smells like i said to
myself what does that even mean really

55
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,359
up it was you know something throughout
that in wanted to be an excuse but yeah

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,300
so i started watching that that have
been from medieval oversight and

57
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,350
government reform so I was watching that
one day I started to watch more

58
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,750
congressional hearings will about cyber
in technology and I noticed the pattern

59
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,590
thing that kept going repeatedly no
matter what what here it was levels we

60
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,270
need more talent which is that go many
different organizations

61
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,250
insert your organization here whoever it
is that's in the media that they face

62
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,260
millions of cyberattacks whether it's
per day per month per year and then the

63
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,120
last thing I keep hearing on a bill is
something for into a cyber Pearl Harbor

64
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,820
I don't know what that looks like maybe
Sofia I have no clue but is that term is

65
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,500
used by the congressman's and Senators
constantly so I stepped down girls like

66
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,330
what is this pirate attack really i mean
you know i have something thoughts about

67
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,310
it but it really depends who you're
asking so and the public sector the

68
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:02,710
government it basically they refer to ca
and it has many interpretations I looked

69
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:10,090
at it already is varying i want to say
too big but it covers a wine cabinet so

70
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,119
that's what they consider the statute of
what a cyberattack really falls under I

71
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,500
kept searching I kept searching I found
another definition that the deal to use

72
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,230
and there is a little more descriptive a
little more in-depth what they

73
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,430
considered cybertek but it really you
know didn't drive homework provide

74
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,360
something for framework of what a
cyberattack really is or what it might

75
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,290
look like

76
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,630
so I'm sure they have their own
definition 5 sure some public entities

77
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,180
like you know sorry is only in wendys
might have a different definition of

78
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,030
what a cyberattack is based on their
experience so one thing that could train

79
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,219
with the tire talking is based on it are
the numbers so I mean a lot of people a

80
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,860
lot of times things they say numbers
don't lie

81
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,090
and sure numbers don't lie but they can
be presented in a way that might be

82
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:16,270
misleading or my and a different picture
than what's actually happening so one of

83
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,430
the things I see in the news constantly
in all the time

84
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:27,200
is you know different tax millions this
millions that I might instill things

85
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,190
myself

86
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,299
it's not really telling me what's really
happening what kind of practices what's

87
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:37,669
happening behind the scenes but if
things get this information they paid a

88
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,500
bigger picture of what's actually
happened because if for example if

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,370
there's a no and attacking your network
if I gotta talk to my boss and say we

90
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,010
need more funding if I just wanna tell
them we got scans you know and there's a

91
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,380
bridge to find a bigger number it's more
like maybe finding some until the bigger

92
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:07,220
number than what actually happened but
the biggest one of all that song was 300

93
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,540
million siren times each day I don't
know what again what they mean by it or

94
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,689
highly calculating it but it's out there
is constant so we'll give you an example

95
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:31,880
of how supported let's take and ssh port
25 word list of ten thousand words and

96
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:40,100
protect IP is it takes three minutes to
do it is reported as 10,000 rapid you

97
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,240
know sophisticated cyber attacks that
was lured to get logging so sure but it

98
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,210
could also be reported in other venues
as one felt intrusion into bed so if I

99
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:01,220
had to let my boss and I don't funding
was one where I probably yeah as a

100
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,660
report of the media as well

101
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,689
another example or you know an even
bigger numbers any bigger news let's try

102
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:18,980
to match getting I want to skin all the
words $65 when in actuality there's door

103
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,720
because I mean you get scared all the
time

104
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,670
so I want to you know get real number
zero data on how you can calculate this

105
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,719
and you know get some information so i
came up with something called parking

106
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,560
lot so products like basically is a
project design and research the

107
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,430
adversaries behavior 11 plus my hairline
is user behavior analytics and analysis

108
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,399
so i could be part of slime to do that
and what product is on the bat is

109
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,290
basically doing the final doing this
every year and be one that's already in

110
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,579
place now is you know deployment on
digital shade it's basically like server

111
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:11,638
and running Kimbo and I'm gonna nice
little website on you know on the web

112
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,879
and less it that let you accumulate some
stats malls so one of the things I'm

113
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,379
interested in and grabbing with the
products lamb is username password

114
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,199
wordlists i'm grabbing the session of
what a personal logs in they get the

115
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:33,269
current password so i didn't want to the
password to large not you know Guetta

116
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:42,029
get an attacker to hit hallway in the
pot so I said pretty reasonably easy for

117
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,370
them to get in because once they get in
the bull sessions is being logged on

118
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,089
what that's the time where they go what
they try to run and things which are

119
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,009
pulling so I also want all the different
you know

120
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,259
tools & downloads that they wanted
inside the environments running so it

121
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,430
also captures that as well that's what
the place now and we'll go over some

122
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,529
steps to manage that

123
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,819
next you're planning on doing something
a little bit more robust instead of just

124
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,910
getting a lot better actually want to
see what they do where they go

125
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:22,980
so right now is there a given
environment that enjoy it and they try

126
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,759
to run different commands and bottom
half of the bands on the approved list

127
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,980
or create a response for that man it
doesn't happen i do allow them to bring

128
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,009
things in the environment if they want
to download something but they don't

129
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:39,120
have access to a thing download and
it'll actually have it so that's what's

130
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,620
currently next year i'm planning on
doing something still in development on

131
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,769
how last-minute implemented fun thing
about using like something like darker

132
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:53,579
creating an entire SS that's going to
extend along machine not networked

133
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,059
anything else and they can actually just
play with it you know pricing data on

134
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,469
their this big data no fake username and
password different things like that to

135
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,470
see where they go see where they go
first what they download what they bring

136
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:10,620
in and they almost are done with the I
just blow it and you know our kind of it

137
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,970
image it and take analysis while i'm
still capturing the same immigration

138
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:21,300
form currently normal values your name
and password tips so staying on b1 and

139
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,609
spend employed now for some wings and
that's my main number that was able to

140
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:34,980
capture 599 thousand intense so I could
you know don't even further in his

141
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,649
capture on these elections but i'm
actually capturing the amount of times a

142
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,120
person actually puts a username and
password in person so they just come to

143
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,189
silently or comes with importantly I'm
not counting them i want the firm number

144
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:55,170
what a person actually attempted
something that would violate the FAA if

145
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:01,319
they actually logged in so that's my
current stacks on some things

146
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,360
saving here or the United unique
companies passwords accumulating all

147
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,370
that and bringing that into the
environment to get you know numbers and

148
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,720
stats and see what's you

149
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,430
is and there's some interesting things
you can also take the data as far as

150
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,790
like died in the geolocation to see you
know what countries even attacking the

151
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,790
box so what country do you think you're
number one

152
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:32,129
china has a big as a serious is pretty
accurate

153
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:45,240
what about her to them precious us so
here are the top countries that are

154
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,110
attacking and us this number to anyone
under 13 and thats stolen more shocking

155
00:14:52,110 --> 00:15:04,980
to see some of me or not but in China
for question so whatever IP that

156
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,790
actually makes the connection to some
doing is going to recitation with some

157
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,050
TCP connections was making the
connection may be wondering manager but

158
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:20,729
I'm only taking again the first approach
so some other unique things in capturing

159
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,759
getting usernames and passwords so again
some of these are no-brainers that they

160
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,290
would be the highest numbers that mean
is different things that's also you know

161
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,889
telling like pad get some username is
your track of course group administrator

162
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:49,920
so training is something that's not here
would be more I was a preferable to

163
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,599
configure to log in on some devices so
the bachelors again some no-brainers

164
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:02,129
song a little surprising and so I mean
our more telling the country as well I

165
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:11,579
mean you know funny my board and mature
but bow or w do I mean some of these are

166
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,959
light you can sort of tell sort of that
is international is not

167
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:24,360
us probably trying along it so yeah
trying to be sending some lettuce runs

168
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,100
into here it won't be a bull market
deployed in like march when beautiful

169
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,980
years so one of the industry things and
calculating is right now only current

170
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,850
path me about 4,000 so that will be 14
million and a tire here so that you have

171
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,410
a full year of actual data but you know
what's next

172
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,900
so I actually want to do all the
information that guy and put it on

173
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,840
github at the end of the year long with
legwork everything I've found different

174
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,319
patterns i saw different usernames the
Iraqi and even the word list so that can

175
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,990
be downloaded and use it

176
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,800
I working maybe even if you don't use
word list will try to crack passwords

177
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,760
with that

178
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,970
download the tennis ball and make sure
your password in there

179
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,530
I mean there are a few passages are you
probably wanna change something that's

180
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,160
different things i plan on doing this
every year it was a lot of it automating

181
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,900
automatically myself then require a lot
of maintenance couple things i would

182
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:41,370
recommend you do something to me pot is
take your data from the why do you

183
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:46,739
hosting some more like digital ocean and
analyzing somewhere else right now i'm

184
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,450
using if you saw the dashboards for the
graphs and charts earlier using body

185
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,380
help

186
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,650
lastly search logs a salon i'm doing
that in the same vm Carly that the

187
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,980
instances going on so digitalocean you
can get a base install the time of month

188
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:11,760
you're just not getting the data that
was fine once I want to actually analyze

189
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,340
it numbers back

190
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,780
yeah one go-round wasn't doing it so
that ten-dollar instance a month went to

191
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,370
swing and when that group

192
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,189
140 so I mean you know take your data
somewhere local and analyze this

193
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,340
somewhere else where you can actually
have more round and it doesn't cost you

194
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,840
four months so that's different document
appointing severe so some of the

195
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,919
takeaways is actually again the word
list

196
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,540
this is basically a lot of the word
lists there's more information on the

197
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,000
back end but this is one of the things I
dumped already and if you want to get

198
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,730
that information it is gonna get out

199
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,120
so one of the things on there is a dump

200
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,330
you have diabetes is that being funny
pot captured it so you can actually go

201
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,710
there some other things

202
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,800
there's two branches there's a
development branch the world riding

203
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:14,470
schools that are absolutely capture
basically a clean install that I don't

204
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,300
think that he's no matter what was wrong
and automatically block IP and all you

205
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,960
can do is either be in this list or any
words that you have a whole . p out of

206
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,309
it and block that RP so that's different
things that are only getting home a

207
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:36,129
couple conclusions basically don't use
simple passwords one thing as a

208
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,740
sophomore room is the highest guess that
they're going to take a lot of disabled

209
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,960
routes that before account but its
ability login through ssh so I'll choose

210
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,600
a username not on that list as well

211
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,409
wall again and then you can elevate your
privilege to route if you really knew

212
00:19:53,410 --> 00:20:01,330
but being it having this same old from
the public login saves you a bunch of

213
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,250
times and it grows over temperature a
big long on some of the other data that

214
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:14,500
is only hi Pat is not give up but that's
a lot of value can show you now is again

215
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,880
it shows you what they actually do on
the server so and this is another name

216
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,170
reason why I like kid below

217
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:45,360
is that you can actually see exactly
would begin the attacker types wasn't

218
00:20:45,360 --> 00:21:10,740
rushing already so one thing you can see
with the type of trap with the temper

219
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,030
with the attacker types and it's pretty
definitely telling and there's an entire

220
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,220
directory of law just like this so we
actually go see exactly what the time

221
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:30,810
where they go and things might work
things might not so it's definitely

222
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:37,950
useful one of the other things i
mentioned before is it has capability to

223
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,900
allow the engine brings different things
and so if they w get involved

224
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,510
it'll actually download the bottom but
they will have access to and sometimes

225
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:55,920
they download some tools and it's
definitely useful as you see harry

226
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:02,730
downloading file you downloaded website
pass intelligence sort of the the level

227
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,040
of your attackers what the downloads web
sites that we want so naughty download

228
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,680
is cool and tries to find it and you
know he might have to have access to it

229
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,130
but again you didn't have so what
question does now I have that tool as

230
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,300
well so actually you know I was curious
what this was

231
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,140
so look at it

232
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
seasons on

233
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,560
so what was this entire trying to do

234
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,409
turns out that tool was beat us I don't
know if you were to himself or if you

235
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:59,970
don't somewhere else but I mean there
was this portion on his parole a program

236
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,050
to basically do all the website so now I
have this world program that you

237
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:10,200
somewhere else or you know I know I need
to disable we're all so different things

238
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:17,100
like that it doesn't is very useful to
get this information but i will say one

239
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,189
of the other unique things that are did
see

240
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,340
and disclaimer this one is not done in
my honey pot that it and actually do

241
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:36,419
this one but this is the funniest one
song so this is this be personal another

242
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,920
one of the interesting and attackers to
actually try to login one and you know

243
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,610
actually watching what is going and
where he's going

244
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,659
maybe this isn't what I don't up but I
mean you can actually get a lot of

245
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,340
information based on watching what
someone tries to do so is definitely in

246
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,370
school in that aspect that now see what
you know domains attacker uses its own

247
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:07,620
where he tries to go and what does he
tries to get now a lot of it works and

248
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,860
you can write their spots for the way
this works is

249
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:18,659
anything things you'll get a response on
ratings will grab the idea and reply and

250
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:26,640
NSF has some attackers are more
persistent another some login

251
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,379
no don't be readily some more persistent
where they will try different things so

252
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,580
we'll figure out pretty quickly as many
but some takes a lot for them to figure

253
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:51,240
out anything about this as well as you
can write the responses you want the tab

254
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:05,490
so if you run the command i want to
service box i can make main and that's

255
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,720
one of the dip for the uniqueness
dialect bucket bows you can actually

256
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:25,559
customize a lot of it and he is pretty
persistent i love you . out so he goes

257
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:40,410
where the pink beans broccoli

258
00:25:48,860 --> 00:26:19,100
he's getting dizzy maybe scheduling
you're traveling 26 students and then

259
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,100
figure

260
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:41,000
so it is a lot of information you can
get from a person on what they try and

261
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:51,380
definitely useful to have a pot for the
main i literally have a directory of

262
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,190
about a hundred to monitor these so I
mean you know taking timing looking

263
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,910
through it and see what's actually out
there to see what they do with the

264
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,860
download and different happening

265
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,428
I got a directory full of downloads of
different files they try to download as

266
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:19,460
well so I mean right are there any
questions not I have a few things you

267
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:26,030
and we had a six-month part-time in
relation to the clubhouse is the little

268
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,049
one

269
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:36,410
so you're not local problem recommending
this one but home is the question what

270
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:45,350
was the name of the hypotenuse so one
back a little bit and another prize you

271
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,280
don't get it

272
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:54,860
another prize is the record label to
green parties were Christmas bomb

273
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:05,330
what was the third green with evil
intent

274
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,080
yeah

275
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:28,790
that's on top and visions that line know
where you're going
