1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
hi folks outta here unfortunately the
microphone was not turned on so we have

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,849
no audio until about the eight minutes
35 seconds mark sorry for the

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,849
inconvenience

4
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,190
yeah

5
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:38,300
yeah

6
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:52,550
there was the last because maybe they
have the microphone but I don't like

7
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,550
what you got a 211

8
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,300
alright continue with this work
according to Ferrin i'm going to grab

9
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:11,899
that microphones and study found so I as
a pretty reliable system for detecting

10
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:20,750
packed executables even if they don't
fire your stay in that case we've gone

11
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,880
another layer it being able to detect
malicious capability so we find

12
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:35,959
something that's acting cryptid to life

13
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:50,689
yeah we have people that ok yeah good
choices which is ok i think now we're

14
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:57,440
recording properly awesome so in in the
case that a executables been seen to be

15
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,779
Pachter our cryptid we might even choose
to adjust the suspicion score a little

16
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:09,380
higher arbitrarily just because while
packers critters are malicious and of

17
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,660
themselves they are most often used for
malicious software right I think we all

18
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,540
know that

19
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,050
and I'm sure you were hoping for more
technical talk i'm hoping for a little

20
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,689
bit more discussion because simply put
as i said before I'm possibly the

21
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,160
world's worst programmer so I'm hoping
to draw a lot of other people into this

22
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,640
effort I'm trying to make it kind of an
open-source heuristics engine really so

23
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,449
i want to draw other people into this i
want to get people talking about it i

24
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,630
want to get people on board with helping
code some of this

25
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,150
so I've written quite a few signatures
been knowles over here who I work with

26
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,620
has written a few i think some of our
signatures are getting packaged in with

27
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,380
rim knocks so that's kinda cool

28
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:06,550
it wasn't our fault I didn't ask him to
do that so I I'm slotted for an hour up

29
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,490
here are there any questions i critiques
criticisms have I missed something

30
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,140
really obvious in this

31
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,140
yes

32
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,449
so far we have not written enough
signatures to be useful for that I'm

33
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,790
definitely getting suspicious
capabilities from known malicious

34
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,839
software that has very low antivirus
detection rates that's obviously not the

35
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,440
same but that's about as close as I've
gotten so far anyone else this will be a

36
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:57,970
very short discussion if there's no
questions labels base specific office so

37
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:05,139
features the same right right now it's
it's a very similar idea it's part of

38
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:10,569
where I got the idea for this actually I
the other part was from RSA security

39
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:18,219
analytics specifically its malware
analysis component so i used to work for

40
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,569
one of their ms ESPYs don't hold that
against me I won't name the company

41
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:28,149
please don't hold it against me but one
of the really cool things about that

42
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,769
module and i'm sure other tools can do
it that's just the one I know but it has

43
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:39,339
the ability to detect files on the wire
and apply your signatures to them and

44
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,560
then in the investigation screen you can
navigate and carve out based on metadata

45
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,899
that supplied arbitrarily by these rules
so at that point i first discovered that

46
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:57,610
almost none of our customers were using
the malware analysis module which made

47
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,680
it not very useful but it kind of in
green this idea in my head that rather

48
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,380
than just looking for known malicious
files i could be looking for known

49
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,199
malicious capabilities instead so I know
some of the some of the signatures you

50
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:20,649
see and security Analytics will be
things like PDF with a bad extract

51
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:26,740
session section and it can detect that
using built-in your rules but we never

52
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,810
had any way to combine those rules into
something that would be high fidelity

53
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:39,189
and that's what I'm trying to do with
this project any anything else

54
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,730
yes

55
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:56,560
aggregation of suspicion rate so many
rules have decades suspicion great role

56
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:10,359
cases while some rules because of the
specific sub the excitation of those

57
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:21,880
together in your mind too much higher
our suspicions so painted just that

58
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:31,660
influence your your rules about you
analyze it is so I run into that in one

59
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:40,510
very specific case in my current job you
know the file i'm talking about it is it

60
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,480
is a daily update i won't speak to all
that much but the heuristics on it and

61
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,690
the capabilities it has look like the
most malicious piece of software ever

62
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,090
written and we wrote it on purpose and
it's completely non-malicious so I'm

63
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,390
definitely still trying to use that and
and similar similar cases to tune down

64
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,370
the ruleset possibly write some
exceptions for specific combinations of

65
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,370
capabilities

66
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:27,640
yes london this exact direction of all
right

67
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:35,620
in this case I was looking for the
windows api call you all looking at more

68
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,140
Gators invasion for around

69
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:49,569
like you stall checking to so I am
working on some heuristics for those I

70
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,210
definitely don't have anything i would
consider production-ready trying to kind

71
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,370
of write those on a case-by-case basis
as I see samples actively using them and

72
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,240
unfortunately i don't have enough time
these days to go out and hunt for

73
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,120
samples so I'm largely limited to just
what crosses my desk at work but yes

74
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,220
absolutely i am making an effort and
would welcome all the help in the world

75
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:21,100
if you if you're into malware research
with the gathering more useful

76
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,100
heuristics for that

77
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:34,420
it's like giving a brown bag at work
it's hard to draw questions out of

78
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,309
people i know you have questions you
want to tell me why I'm wrong why this

79
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:39,999
won't work

80
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:49,600
come on do it no all right well this may
be the shortest talk in the history of

81
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,739
b-sides then maybe not I don't know
somebody may have given like a 10-minute

82
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,899
presentation

83
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:18,220
do you have anything like your you're
involved in this effort to track of is

84
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:27,069
the pivot from using garbage files
pieces of viable created a wide area

85
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,299
network trying to back towards these
capabilities

86
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:40,239
what is operable handing you are a good
match recover the time you are all kinds

87
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,480
of places we can use other tools

88
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,380
the things that is a lot at work as well
as an ls3 time every analysis and base

89
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:57,580
price books to know that can be actually
runs hard he gets hungry so able to use

90
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,510
the tools that were trying to write
please help to evaluate capabilities

91
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:10,360
models his memory as well as an effort
to write . oh really great way to

92
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:19,750
extremely vulnerable because it's
already active scripted and possibly

93
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:27,790
already done something pushes so streets
inviting are their first find the case

94
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:39,250
of us in charge of writing rules and
figuring on your right is part of it

95
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:52,570
really helped out massive processing is
going to be specific environment so you

96
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,629
don't want to do that with that

97
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,690
that's great but you can have a single
idea or malicious or

98
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,450
pictures of software capability and
possibly one or more street for lots of

99
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:16,360
lights that indicate that stuff it up
your logo

100
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:27,340
you know we should be able to help and I
really think we both ways as a

101
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:34,269
supplement section that we already have
because using substitution additional 80

102
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:40,179
scanner that you might have a little
more control over this message you so

103
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:53,200
much and it's so and I on that note I
would like to make the point I'm not

104
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,490
presenting this as the be all and end
all that's going to end the antivirus

105
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,460
business by any stretch of the
imagination

106
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,460
it's just another tool in the toolbox

107
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:11,320
I hope that we can build it into a
really really useful tool and I i'm

108
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,360
going to keep reiterating i will
consider criticism every bit as valuable

109
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,769
as any input you may have so please let
me know if I'm doing this all wrong

110
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:32,320
he's gonna let me know so I this idea
zone says it all

111
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:42,090
signature like lines you started this
like really easy method of exacting the

112
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:57,209
desolation and for all so that s going
on the ball so to differentiate with

113
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:11,640
pride remote system filled an optional
likely has ever write any wants reports

114
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:20,850
that certainly interested in any binary
and graces with patience and a lot of

115
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,799
the most common progress from it is out
there

116
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:38,100
absolutely my yeah absolutely and that's
hadn't actually thought of that so

117
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:45,928
awesome you taking notes on this okay

118
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:56,970
yes everybody else

119
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:11,400
sure it's okay fair enough any any other
questions commentary

120
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:14,909
yes

121
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:42,560
shadows are operational her life here

122
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:50,420
yeah so that is a huge part of what I'm
unsuccessfully trying to write and why

123
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,100
I'm trying to draw they're coders and
it's easily possible through your Python

124
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:01,730
so if you didn't know there is a a
python module specifically for

125
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:09,350
interacting with Yara you just need to
be a good enough programmer to do it and

126
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:16,010
for anything beyond assembly i'm fairly
ignorant as nearly as I can tell i'm i'm

127
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,110
the only person below the age of 50 who
learned assembly and think C++ is

128
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:29,659
confusing so yes rose

129
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:45,960
community or the application install
also runs all the reason i dropped

130
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:54,480
curious i would compare and contrast to
other frameworks like a lot more like

131
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:05,070
Los sounds so I admittedly i've heard of
like a boss i have not haven't so much

132
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:11,428
as get cloned it by keep telling myself
I need to but there's never enough time

133
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:20,220
that said both so I definitely want to
do the community rules repo and then

134
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,860
whatever code ends up being finalized
for a framework I want to host that open

135
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,508
source as well so it's it's definitely
there for anybody who wants to download

136
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:34,919
and use it but it is also there for
anybody who wants to modify it or make

137
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:41,549
it better please do and if nobody else
contributes all eventually post my code

138
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,840
but i don't recommend using it i'm a
very very bad programmer i can't

139
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
reiterate that enough

140
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:00,119
alright if there are no more questions
that's all I had

141
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,749
I will be hanging around for a little
while if anybody wants to find me and

142
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:11,159
talk offline or up here is my email and
my twitter so

143
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:23,190
you can certainly find me thank you
