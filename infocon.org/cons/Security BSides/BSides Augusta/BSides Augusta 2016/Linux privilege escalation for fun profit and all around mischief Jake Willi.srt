1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,730
you know clap yeah you guys have no idea
what you're in it could be more so

2
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,409
oh that was actually the wrong starts
logic this is not off to an awesome

3
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,609
start on the second will start from the
beginning where we should have started

4
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,340
originally hey what's that we're just
remove all yeah thats hey stop that

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,950
because people were getting injured
right the smooth balls were a wearing

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,390
formal actually were awesome but then
people started getting injured so what's

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,550
that I know they stopped because people
are getting injured as is the reason

8
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,000
they stopped them up because people got
progressively worse some screwball or

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,110
better and better depending on which
ended but you were on snowball launchers

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,660
some of them were gasps assisted which
technically the DC police . a fan of

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,459
either and so the year that it was ran
at how is over the hyatt and they had

12
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,689
snoop on plus the National Catholic
girls high school basketball

13
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,220
championship i was at our hotel the
overflow hotel across the street they're

14
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,250
gonna BDSM conference at so it was
awesome i mean it was it was probably

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,409
the best rubicon ever was also the last
year football so ya know screwballs I

16
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,950
just this year i'll be doing the linux
privilege escalation somebody said wow

17
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,570
this is out of your depth or you're out
of your outer normal normal things you

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,179
do don't you normally just do malware
and I said wow ok I guess clearly need

19
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,210
to branch out more i'm now when
forensics is what i was told that i

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,449
thought id primarily but I want to do a
little bit about linux privilege

21
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,860
escalation the company rendition infosec
and it does a lot of work in the

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,670
penetration testing and it's a response
fear you guys can come up here and

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,790
happily set up front here I do not need
these monitors please don't block the

24
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,630
thing come on down further people trying
to fill in behind you happily just sit

25
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,048
down here you can even turn around and
watch those monitors right there's

26
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,530
monitors right there is awesome just
fill in right so

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,790
in addition I said we do a lot of that
instant response and penetration testing

28
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,100
and for a pen testing standpoint oh my
goodness we see all kinds of problems on

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,430
linux servers all day long and started
putting this together as work with

30
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,850
Brandon mccreless he's back there
somewhere waiting for hand around your

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,019
brand and we were kind of gaming this
out we just flew back after midnight

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,370
last night for us from another
conference that we were doing some

33
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,959
network friends that stuff at we're kind
of game of finding out like hey how what

34
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,430
do we need to take out of this talk

35
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,220
it wasn't a question what we put into a
talk like this it was like there's no

36
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,880
way this is going to fit in our
particular demos and so we think we've

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,980
got this nailed down here pretty well

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,940
also we've got some itunes gift cards as
well as the former condition as well as

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,530
some other other giveaways

40
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,820
tweet tweet a tradition sec or at
malware Jake well i guess for additional

41
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,470
seconds what brands we're looking for

42
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,160
he'll grab here the best three tweets
from the talk and itunes gift cards

43
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,630
right plus we have other stuff from the
clubhouse clubhouse and a land turtle

44
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,809
however you guys know where the land
turtle but this is the best thing going

45
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,250
because one they're freaking awesome and
to their sold out because music has been

46
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,060
doing some really interesting work with
them and they sold out hak5 no idea

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,720
where they're going to be a backorder
but this is like your one and only

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,140
chance to get one of these so I don't
know what we're going to do to test for

49
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,640
this one but we'll see

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,390
so you don't care who I am I'll see the
agenda let's talk about for any you

51
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,518
don't or you wouldn't be here right so
movie

52
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,160
what are we doing here look I want to
get through obviously important linux

53
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,140
machines units machines you name it

54
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,649
we're gonna work on 1x today because
that's what runs best my BM but know

55
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,400
that most of these techniques just work
and they're gonna work regardless

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,350
whether it's 1x or units rh boxer for
Iraq's or whatever weird schoo if you

57
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,049
haven't asked on your environment
actually have stolen your environment

58
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,140
set a fire in the server room that's
probably about the best way to get rid

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,768
of it but sure that realistically just
going to work

60
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,600
we're going to talk about to Colonel
issues program issues stuff that

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,510
shouldn't be set to ide inset GID and I
actually moved us to the end of the

62
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,798
presentation what we'll do some more
work there that really vulnerable set

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,200
uid programs look at some cron jobs talk
with script

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,090
the week permissions over your where
we're going by the way yesterday

65
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,400
this is another one of my wonderful boys
grandchildren somebody tweeted out that

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,810
this was I think besides augusta tweeted
out that this was a James Brown themed

67
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,710
event and I said what the heck this is a
hundred we retweets all happened to

68
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,729
James Brown impression a bad James Brown
Russian every time we pop a root shell

69
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,510
mostly demos reports the end so stand
tight i'm not going to read it on the

70
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,830
promise here will still be still be
doing some bad James Brown impressions

71
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,130
unfortunately most of the james brown
stuff that i found besides thing which

72
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,030
i'm not going to do which came around
drunk on CNN talking about the beating

73
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,929
his wife

74
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,960
we're getting a divorce or something
along those lines so I thought about

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,930
bringing some props like a let pipe and
a fake gun and then I thought no that's

76
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,990
probably not going to work well
definitely not what is you and not with

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,030
these sides discussed so we'll just
elation motivations you don't have root

78
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,320
of the box you want did some work with
HP Gary back in the day how many folks

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,800
knew about HP Gary and folks know about
HP report i got hacked

80
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,080
right exactly right that water hands go
down there and so HP area you probably

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,280
know is running a linux server they
called a support server folks and upload

82
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,719
files here and do all kinds of wonderful
stuff and and and turns out a lot of

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,860
people shell on the box and some people
I guess we'll calm anonymous I don't

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,040
know that we ever knew who exactly they
were expanding the name there they

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,220
decide they want to read on the box and
they took it right of course that's an

86
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,040
obvious motivation you don't have what
you wanted only reason we all really

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,800
wrong item site sure we can write any
file persist between reboots you want to

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,320
bind a low number port and so like a tcp
port 80 for instance has a low number

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,610
below 10 24-port you gotta have refers
to do it simple desolations I don't mind

90
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,020
reactions we do a lot of contesting I
don't say it don't use binary exploits

91
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,210
the man do we ever work to not do that
it's xcode us has a great pen testers

92
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,260
pledge effectively goes something like
never use an exploit when you can use PS

93
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,789
exact right I'm kind of in the same mode
here with with with linux I'm not gonna

94
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,380
use an exploit it something way more
graceful works and the reality is in

95
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,639
$YEAR 9 out of 10 of our

96
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,719
pentesting rendition something else has
worked really really well we've only had

97
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,740
to resort to binary exploits in in one
or two cases over the last couple of

98
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,129
years because the reality here is every
time you run a binary export you are

99
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:49,719
risking a crash there's no two ways
about it and as a consultant i really

100
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:53,919
try not to crash my clients machine or
even processes on the machines

101
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,609
nobody likes that turns out even when
you say but you signed off on the scope

102
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,090
of work

103
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,258
nobody's cool with it still I've tried
it doesn't work don't do it to frame so

104
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,699
we want to do that is a very very last
little some purple desolation the weight

105
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:12,789
because sometimes maybe I get to write a
file to the Crown d directory that's

106
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,029
unfortunate well it's unfortunate that
you let me write something the chron d

107
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,229
directory

108
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,859
when is that going to run well next time
cron roxrite or in some cases when

109
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,129
kranti restarts that we read that
directory depending under system

110
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:28,509
configuration as you know linux systems
in unix systems sometimes stay up for a

111
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,909
long walk times maybe a a long waiting
game but if you're eight if you're a

112
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:39,039
nation-state you know for instance I
don't know China or I don't know I maybe

113
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,188
some other nation state we could think
about that might be in the room here but

114
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:45,849
if you're our nation's day and you're
willing to wait that kind of time then

115
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,469
you got the long game

116
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,860
hey you know will take advantage of this
now i get there is a minor export come

117
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,000
back behind us i'm not gonna wait you're
to gain root on a box but if that's all

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,370
i can do then that ok war right now way
from going on

119
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,259
so what about Colonel issues this is a
captain obvious kind of moment here i

120
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,969
want colonel issues as much as the next
guy p.m. splice certainly am spice

121
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,080
exploits are cool heat race exploits
really cool i would see a lot of ptrace

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,258
floating around over different linux
versions i don't understand what it is

123
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,800
about Pete raised but apparently it is
way hard to get right

124
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,879
ptrace if you're not familiar you should
definitely take this home and go look at

125
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,060
ptrace ptrace is a linux d butter and
effectively ptrace allows you to debug

126
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,489
programs now we're talking about a
minute set uid programs one as the user

127
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,709
that the file now if you're running a
debugger which means you're in god mode

128
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,459
allowing you to run a set uid by

129
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,810
Mary in the debugger or you're in god
mode where the binary runs as route

130
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,449
would be a tremendously stupid idea and
linux developers despite having a huge

131
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,030
affinity for penguins are not idiots
right

132
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,140
and despite having their own servers
hack still not idiots right and so

133
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,600
they've actually look at this is that ok

134
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,050
oh I'm doing mine your grace

135
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,850
we're not actually going running his
route well turns out the way that they

136
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,000
end up having to do that is it runs this
route for just a split second before

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,650
drops permissions as a split-second like
a split nanosecond and if you're a

138
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,579
computer science student or student of
the game here you will know that that's

139
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,810
a race condition and there have been a
lot of times we're gonna screw that up

140
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,800
there are lots of heat race owner
ability have involved involve different

141
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,930
race conditions in different scenarios
where and turns out a lot of our linux

142
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,880
kernel exploits actually do rely on
those race conditions though so one of

143
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,820
the first things i'm gonna do when i'm
looking at the linux system

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,110
Brandon stock and later today about some
of the voice over IP systems that we run

145
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,260
into lots of Internet of Things I think
it's talk his name the internet of

146
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,090
terrible basically redefining IOT i
absolutely love that but the amount of

147
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,470
the IOT devices from 1x under the hood
we keep seeing the i was at lowes a

148
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,880
couple of days ago and soft fridge
fridge running linux tell me why your

149
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,780
fridge needs to run linux I have no idea
as it turns out that i kid you not in my

150
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,839
fridge at home I have something on egg
minder if you haven't seen an egg minder

151
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,390
amazon that thing because it's freaking
awesome

152
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,250
it actually is a in IOT device that
holds eggs and tells you over smartphone

153
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,080
app by waking running linux / smartphone
app over your Wi-Fi how well you are an

154
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,980
egg so while you're at the store you can
go look and see how many eggs you but it

155
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,340
even tells you which egg you need to use
next and when your eggs are going bad

156
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,700
because nothing sucks like making a
foray comet breaking the first three

157
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,850
into the pan and find out that fourth
one is not okay

158
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,450
you just wasted the other three eggs
around a three-egg omelette than a new

159
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,250
angle

160
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,650
is actually pretty nasty anyway so again
looking at all the stuff on linux we

161
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,569
want to know what version is it running
if it's an IOT device odds are good god

162
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,140
help us

163
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,780
odds are good it's probably 1x2 off sex
maybe I usually sit outside for whatever

164
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,540
reason i guess the long development
times that was the exploit mitigations

165
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,310
our place we're going to look for the
full corner working with you name- a

166
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,930
we're also going to look at least as
issue there's sexy issue and it's issue

167
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,010
. natural depends on your actual just
drove 1x which one you're going to have

168
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,040
this is going to tell you something fun
to is it red hat

169
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,430
sometimes these particular grade
distributions make some configuration

170
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,579
error that we can capitalize again I
like to work harder

171
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,210
there's a everybody's Everwood knows i'm
extremely lazy and I'm not going to work

172
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,510
any harder than I have to get the job
done if there's some this configuration

173
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,950
here we can take advantage of that's
where we're going first right so let me

174
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,770
google that for you little issues girls
as walls at least now if I find a binary

175
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,850
exploit in the colonel we're gonna go
hit that know who were to catalog that

176
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,850
way as a last resort

177
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,230
let's not do that again just to remind
the hospital doesn't use it to talk

178
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:12,380
about my table made a call i work force
and there's a privilege escalation stuff

179
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:19,100
in there say the background want to see
you can run your way around the other

180
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,810
stairs there's stairs

181
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:27,500
everybody's happy they're all fighting
anyway so stable you might go to meet

182
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,210
you crash you might be brash office and
we run the Bible course of apples all

183
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:39,020
most like a little desolation life fam
right and export machine and i am also

184
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,059
and right now I got cool because you do
anything

185
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:51,909
no alert the responder so I'm like no
yes think again totally crashed lost

186
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:57,639
nothing says is hey all these farmers
like not having machine available

187
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:04,989
ok so let's put my desire to go back to
get you pop em splice is a great example

188
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:06,699
is awesome

189
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:12,339
virtual members twice actually has to be
able to override memory space which as

190
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:17,319
you might imagine is a really really bad
feature as for the next operation have

191
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:24,069
you can then take you is your privileges
which is now it works pretty reliable

192
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:29,649
but it also generates a bunch of garbage
is really obvious garbage

193
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:35,108
it's one of those actually seen it once
or twice you're like hey what's going on

194
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:35,919
here

195
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:44,859
slice and purple ship of escalation of
all modified versions walk-off racer

196
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:49,389
alright we also offer raised with basic
simple explanation is usually true we

197
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,559
have to go back and say hey let's go to
civil exploit first because the Civil

198
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:02,079
turns out because similar is always that
record so you're writing services Bruce

199
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,089
off right

200
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,039
you would think blocks this morning it
turns out 2016 I haven't fallen horrible

201
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,479
or something is this place this
continued to see services running this

202
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:18,609
word last year tradition was doing some
work with a or medical and the

203
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:28,449
organization and valor i'm running a web
server you should go riding services

204
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:36,008
network cable running web servers
particularly when you have a cgi is

205
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,220
really not a bad idea

206
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,579
and then i bought it can't get any worse
than this

207
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:50,920
still waiting for it we found it for
later and we're going to be this bad

208
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,670
hand

209
00:14:51,670 --> 00:15:01,149
why later need twitter base hospital or
they can actually explain to you because

210
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:08,800
somebody in mathematics job is obvious
modern alleviate the number of AC all

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,019
survivors percent and you said just like
you don't understand i met my 76 have a

212
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:21,790
web-based money value up

213
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,589
hey love online trying to get back
always scale back the number of the

214
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,829
nurse made available for they've got
some crazy

215
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,939
just make sure bridge sure my girlfriend
is your name is everything out there

216
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:42,939
we've got way too many services running
as for not a lot more very I hope we're

217
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:47,439
not talking about your production 1 x
server that's updated with the loss that

218
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:55,899
eight hopefully you're not going to be
happy so see your iOS devices devices on

219
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,319
your network and run i'm gonna leave a
couple vendors out of this we're gonna

220
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,729
respond

221
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,899
out of all the way back better and just
one just one frequency read all of your

222
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:15,040
backups are going onto the device can be
sore right user cannot see a first

223
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
problem

224
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,990
emc emc right but probably more so now
i'm super away anyway and so this is

225
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,300
something that people are a lot of money
figure of Absolution we're supposed to

226
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,769
be going to flip awesome and all kinds
of awesome something you can use it off

227
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:40,089
and again the name is growing worldwide
look behind programs is way better than

228
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,689
you might do not practice sheet in most
cases service falls over and resource

229
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,290
this is my whole place for me to be
because hopefully nobody notices that

230
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:56,649
service just fell over and I got a box
eventually and then eventually i can go

231
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,660
ahead and hopefully lost this is a great
time to tell you absolutely figure extra

232
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,319
login we recommend you have a7 place all
the time

233
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,549
security event information management
place you really want to make contact

234
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:13,869
with his pants right make sure you do is
sort of logging that makes the attacker

235
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:18,458
thing very very very very hard about
what they're going to do next and so by

236
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:24,939
your exploits to get much better program
i'm going to show up at a configuration

237
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,860
don't get off your back your car working
and working record we see this all the

238
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,139
time it's my lord I like shooting
yourself beautifully there's a place

239
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,799
number ways sometimes horses it was
looking for a man happy someone path you

240
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,830
have to do this one right

241
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,889
that's number one too . end of the path
then always access given me as family

242
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:56,380
were in general just go do it and when
you find it you something about ahead of

243
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,779
large 1i never set in place because 10
times out of ten more

244
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:09,429
look at what are really vulnerable to
idlebury else race is casi al by the

245
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,320
balls and so we love all trace miles
racing things that you wanted to let you

246
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,950
guys in on there are ridiculous number
of these homegrown use systems all lot

247
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,769
of our systems administrators have
figured out they can offset 471 and have

248
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:32,169
helped doesn't actually help desk go a
little bit help asking then shortly

249
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,729
after resources systems administrator
and I did not because I do so want to

250
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:41,320
just walk into the room access to my
sister and very quickly though I figured

251
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,399
out and needed some access file path and
finger soon will be the way to do this

252
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:54,849
on my cool i'll give them to access but
not overall to asset managers are

253
00:18:54,849 --> 00:19:00,249
reasonable problem that we're back in
here it's all my cool all spread script

254
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:06,159
i'll set you said you ID and turns out
that connects smart public scripts to

255
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,229
use my tea you're going to step back

256
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:13,869
whoa that's a bad idea let's not do that
and go ahead and Google that first eight

257
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:18,309
results come on somewhere at the bottom
of page long back over to track this

258
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:24,039
morning like don't have to do that right
but the results are hey here's how to

259
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:30,759
program which can be said calls her
script and so the idea here is rather

260
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:37,629
your scripting YT c program and second
one is RuPaul's our script ass burgers

261
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:43,359
and it's completely my ass fashion mall
and we'll have to follow

262
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,769
there's no way to fix this right
safeguards in place

263
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:52,450
this is like driving a car to take a
boat out he was punched in the airbag or

264
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,450
you start going to take off friday hello

265
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:05,010
all connections here to save you from
just so awesome right away great the

266
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,470
Great screenshot looking for one year

267
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:15,180
go find your ready 1080p security all
right we're looking for providing for

268
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:24,030
legitimate send you a perfect Christmas
set white hall was a regular girl that's

269
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,030
a good thing has to jail

270
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,000
we have to be a lot of st shadow we
don't regularly happen but in general

271
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,300
the problem glad you're all other
practices knows where the system so

272
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,840
these third-party and installations I'm
not going soon so I'm not gonna mention

273
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:51,870
names like horrible sideways software
can be hot it's all white configurations

274
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,899
of them do my lawyers will not say
anything

275
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,990
ok so anyway Ron's all right so you can
recall a bottle or manually problem

276
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:08,400
while my some distribution of the answer
is yes right out-of-the-box doesn't do

277
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,530
anything to you but it doesn't really
give me a hint where you go next

278
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,659
can I can I didn't go to the directory
there see how I write too many of those

279
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,420
directories and overwrite interesting
job called a script is that was right

280
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,720
we'll be alright but it's rideable
diamond and the answer is yes you win

281
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,480
because the next time on Top fires it's
an alum and my shoes so I eventually

282
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,730
prompted to record that case I on
restart possibly root for the next time

283
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,809
man has changed the wrong cause there's
a lot of opportunities here we have a

284
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:52,779
to be happy without me permissions on
scripts in general i'm looking around

285
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:57,580
and i think we're going to be called by
one of the first place that I go here in

286
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,559
later versions of their version of linux
I start doubling system configuration we

287
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,759
almost great so older versions will
actually go hope sen e record Starling

288
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:15,129
the script available there- scripts
their start looking for and see where

289
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:23,408
you are most worthy script not specified
path is calling President as opposed to

290
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:31,119
let's say a call after they call slash
bin slash caps full of all fully behind

291
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,830
the path we just guessing right we're
guessing that's a potential place but we

292
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:42,789
can gain some employees in meijer you
always do this sunlight and so that can

293
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:47,889
possibly different cat and the one
script off attended could potentially be

294
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:52,269
called we don't just check the script
all of our users many of these callers

295
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:59,769
now one thing is you gotta want it is in
many cases units in any case don't Sh

296
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:05,439
so I convention we expected and say
there's no requirement that you and so a

297
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,929
lot of minus C being all some
configurations where you go take a look

298
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:17,289
at their realize itself actually spread
cattle were possible lot of those a

299
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,600
little bit or maybe just one mile action
all liner or higher

300
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,320
depending on the platform or is it
actually script in which case soon

301
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,460
actionscript in which case law school is
we can write to that one of the

302
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,720
dependencies is a half reversible off
dependencies we're looking for something

303
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,960
that could impact change on from our
position information alliance is this

304
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,830
all goes well in most Linux environments
you're not gonna be able to write

305
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:52,740
directly write my memories too bad so
sad again these are installs and stuff

306
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,360
happens together

307
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,790
oh my goodness i like it i recently
found one

308
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:05,520
we are fast system where user local bien
I have every set to wear right and we

309
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,600
like that at all

310
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,439
local business right but the actual
record as much the system so we know

311
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,070
we're back to back like that as a place
where is the man has not realize they've

312
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:28,860
done and failed to unscrew apple because
while so it turns out the user local

313
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,270
businesses in the past have some other
stuff that should have been I know dark

314
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,810
friend and so I just adding files there
in the next time

315
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:45,600
random we are set up and run giving a
shot so we're happy about that and

316
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,679
you're wrong

317
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,960
alright i agree right it's much more
common to find records bad version than

318
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,690
the actual of the actual miles talk
about permissions on

319
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,190
not with all the reload this is another
google it I don't have time to walk

320
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:07,350
through all the low it's like we're
going to be your man figure out when you

321
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,159
use this one your hands but it is
something with putting into your bag

322
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,270
tricks activity the idea with all the
reload and we're here for last year's

323
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:21,090
b-sides best I get off on exploiting
windows systems using the other side so

324
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:28,320
actually be all Jack I will cover the
most up with this is your final over a

325
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,889
regular program of those malicious
libraries ones enhance very common on

326
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:41,460
Windows turns out reasonably well i will
be reloaded going to do it yourself

327
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,590
environment when we say here were fine
copies of libraries like me to pretty

328
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,959
loaded into memory in case you need
special organ library one normally on

329
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:59,970
the system and can give us a tremendous
tremendous access as possible running an

330
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:05,070
elevated privileges runs is actually
floating harbors of our library

331
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:13,080
resources that we win permissions the
bad news you're walking talking to

332
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,810
understand most offenders and investors
actually wasn't the most badass

333
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:27,540
flashback goes and goes with vendors or
raise your hand bringing never got ok

334
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,570
want to go to events and

335
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:37,340
the majority of the room here myself
organized but LD preload developer even

336
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,919
sampled is awesome i want to developers
looking nice hey satan program

337
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:52,160
permissions and we probably should have
because as I imagined that via that so

338
00:26:52,160 --> 00:27:03,620
is it a one-run permission to I eat
don't army lo a lot of cool

339
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,449
you can't eat mission valley below
that's not what I said all i said was

340
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,550
you can't use this % YTD programs but
oftentimes you manipulate the

341
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:19,100
environment some of these startup
scripts are folded because the community

342
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,780
like the environment in which case you
can preload bands that are running as

343
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:32,629
just not necessarily white binary I
doing this I'm like so I don't run roll

344
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:41,150
your we are going off shelves minute
talking muscle sort of anybody so again

345
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,470
this in your bag tricks the research
this is a great blast all fails

346
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,740
sometimes I can be honest bottom alright
we're probably chasing down black binder

347
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,140
so just to know how to perform sometime
maybe in case we're locking pliers for

348
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:06,920
the last for about six yd + GI amazing
mrs. Madden not understand what should

349
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:13,490
be said UND and said any man this is
really a lot of us don't have

350
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:19,970
permissions to go soon have permission
to go do other things

351
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,679
this is where we get the majority of icy
about eighty percent of our just

352
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,230
relation comes because we find manage
people exposed were able to compromise a

353
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,780
help desk for a administrator whether
it's the accounting department for the

354
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,440
letters that one guy thinks he's gonna
help out

355
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:49,220
so imagine how many adult permissions
for persons they can take a while or

356
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,940
student general awesomeness and it turns
out to have 441 packs right I were

357
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,460
talking about a couple of these here
obviously any man to do anymore work

358
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,460
obviously I can overwrite files as i can
write as a shadow means i can overwrite

359
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,510
password for really crappy a guitar when
do I DNA and that means the next we'll

360
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:23,300
check my password to go find my way 0
which means to do basically just so we

361
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,540
don't want to allow our attackers to
overwrite files and . flower x-files if

362
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,570
we allow our users to overwrite files
and organs was back in Game permissions

363
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:41,780
at will I use to access the course again
these rights violations and i use those

364
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:53,480
missions we see on your head is now set
your mind to go

365
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,510
this is really stupid right if you have
an ever-growing permission set that

366
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:05,180
means the actors / users can just go on
the editor automatically game rules

367
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,559
we've also seen this ad

368
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,039
Apple alright so we've seen attackers
that have changed permissions on

369
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,240
changing vs. Donkey go or some other
editor that's not used very often by

370
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,470
anybody and thanks to do that said eat
and lost some of their back on their

371
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:29,820
positions with limited editions they
just nana addo a shadow and the back any

372
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:39,178
other matter you're not so this response
and also a little more general security

373
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,480
sample will make sure and one security
assessment we did with a laugh this is

374
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,169
really dumb

375
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:50,909
you shouldn't do this and yeah like
getting my danger will robinson danger

376
00:30:50,909 --> 00:31:02,909
danger rock fragments for our entire
world anyway I love we sincerely

377
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:11,009
americans are stupid up have permission
liners know that most really work

378
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:16,110
crystal atmosphere is windows that you
have here did a couple of Linux machines

379
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,428
morning these or start out of appliances
that was supposed to the lyonses is

380
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:27,210
where we originally got google or some
other company has her on her own and so

381
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,409
one of the last fashion manufacturer
modality you have under certain shell

382
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:34,409
access go to work because you are really
on

383
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:40,229
I was just happens Ricky's office hey I
got it figured out you're going to get

384
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:46,859
around this problem and i'm sure you can
move all just try this for like where'd

385
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:50,549
you come up with us they're like Google
and this was suggest your life there is

386
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:58,590
no way that the top pasta just the first
page just really bad

387
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,799
all right i mean back was thinking about
writing on fast and advice print and I

388
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,759
guess my heart and so basically to go
right

389
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,739
how are secure our bike we're right back

390
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:24,210
I don't have a longer game display but
maybe 13 or any other business so that

391
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:30,960
means it's so stupid we had dropped us
right to charge controllers just don't

392
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:39,629
do it right and the eye and let me show
you what is really really back so I've

393
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:48,090
got to turn off your this is my user
Jake we're gonna go ahead and we're

394
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,049
going to make a bigger person seems like
good plans you wanna going to go with

395
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,779
yeah that'll work

396
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:03,090
alright everybody back to go anywhere so
start thinking to myself I want to see

397
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:11,580
watch Jake actually let's super around
make your password password by the way

398
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,389
earlier this week I probably saw its up
with the admin password and username

399
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,409
in people's faces were going to actually
got some really interesting and really

400
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,789
interesting stuff there anything I me
right cool part was some of the most

401
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:34,210
interesting it's alright so it seems to
indicate they were found on standing the

402
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,210
internet rather than that to my bank
popular today you know well lots of

403
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,039
people lots of crazies out there are a
lot of interesting interesting native

404
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:57,158
also really bad like that anyway I got
the cap an echo in Alaska at you like

405
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:03,460
you should be able to look at my life
and redirect the app and it turns out it

406
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,040
isn't that right there are couple of
your legacy unit systems that are

407
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,020
demonstrated 1x is not right so when you
do that greater designed for quite a

408
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,190
while

409
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:21,668
next every recent life anyway I just
experienced the boys and they will end

410
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:27,908
up such all that special not running
with permission so where's right there

411
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:35,409
the student person's vision is there a
half just walks and brocco LS we've seen

412
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:43,869
this one there's not a lot with us to go
LOL i know that the idea while I want

413
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:52,510
matter particle scribe front of you is a
show that's not nice to you is shadow

414
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,760
better

415
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,030
oh you're not my actual original is that
so

416
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:18,840
look at me i'm so so hold on here in
this case probably by the eyeliner look

417
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,980
I can change the password hash no
password and do something awesome here

418
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,200
this is already known as password that's
cool bar schools and she'll run shallow

419
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,740
man beyond asking why but so many great
ideas can and the problem here is that

420
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:43,169
privilege escalation shall our symbols
here is not roots and pound sign means

421
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:51,840
you are thats that's a bad day . was all
the resume updated right so okay so

422

itself we want to go ahead and not not

424
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,009
fail this

425
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:08,520
that's kinda one of my goals in life
always a mostly do beyond oh I said I

426
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:19,020
was good i anyway so last night last
certainly is that guy's thumb is

427
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,380
probably ok i'm not actually know most
people think of losses and her less is

428
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,670
better

429
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:33,630
this is a little off man hey why did you
never write

430
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:40,320
hello les is definitely there now
everyone says you're probably saying

431
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
just background modern bunch of use

432
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,119
Manos of all that and so you have
changed all that shy always say now

433
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,290
doesn't like social but it happens to be
that or that your last resort of all

434
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,420
editors the i order on pretty much any
other ways distribution of all editors

435
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,280
him a lesson

436
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:15,990
turns out is it also should look so less
three sous sous les as you have nothing

437
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:24,629
personal but so so we're going to do
here all turns out i ve drop the matter

438
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,549
what happens by in this case and she'll
get more back

439
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:37,740
ok so this is no pop show you allow
somebody last vial the reason you do

440
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,308
this

441
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:45,329
turns out in most cases is because you
got some file barbers but help other

442
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,230
users needs to be able to see this is
like having a barbecue after one back

448
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,540
jumping in and out of area

449
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,029
ok so i will know soon more Morris just
not have focused on less than ever

455
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:55,640
let's do this more as you want to give
Paige I said anybody that was a lot

456
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,900
right but something always create a
full-page problem or I could just roll

457
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,770
my screen now where was a little more
bottom of page so anyway you're going to

458
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,490
go ahead and type ! bang

461
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:30,980
hour after this again also like yeah

because you're all bats somebody in this

463
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,660
room was doing some song next probably
on a built-in wise

464
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,899
hey great many more are some of these
than golden you don't want it all I want

465
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:55,310
you don't want you guys my kid my kid
needs to go all right all the way and

466
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:02,390
that I lost greatest response so i
strongly urge nothing we're off

467
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:15,290
and I kidding ok so what else can we do
a little bit of america russia now

468
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:22,610
anyway so i can meet the ok so i think
of a good reason we can't think we were

469
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:29,210
super popular move to be in school
anywhere at all hear it and there's no

470
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:35,990
reason for no reason this but but it
turns out that is all the high i find

471
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:41,930
your students file you created fire
something right because you can talk to

472
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:48,350
remove file system first artifacts and
Bobby and shadows something else they

473
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:55,670
can read that's obviously not there also
your hackers la cabins by the way they

474
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,990
can pop your move

475
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:01,220
there's a really interesting ways to
destroy the disc actually use some

476
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,899
destructive impact as well so that's
really interesting one here I go again

477
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:13,040
gets off also needs a boost but in
general I want to meet your fine

478
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,970
you see this one regular and purpose the
purpose here is it and are systemic war

479
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:25,490
helpdesk you will go files so we have a
web server and web server are vulnerable

480
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,870
web servers turnout supposed to
integrate some really more of all this

481
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:36,799
and so one of the things that might help
desk do find with student wishes to go

482
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,480
find files larger than one device in the
art or her heart out of temper or

483
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,150
whatever and then exactly move man
against those that once you once you

484
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,440
give users

485
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,440
agri-food versions fine they can do
whatever they want

486
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:03,379
suicune my flight was supposed to or six
to find iris and as dressing and so SE

487
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:11,180
and we could find all hot and you doing
exactly LOL little race here with the

488
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:19,160
Australian semicolon says they'll all be
yours case and so we can go into longer

489
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:32,118
are we exactly and off or we just grow
so either way you can find runs for

490
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:39,170
finding exactly fine i heard that you're
the finest it's matched in terms of

491
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,380
actually doing for followed appliance
but that's not important because

492
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,000
bachelors special system call it all
when he's only a copy of action so we

run miles were you named the problem is

500
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,819

soon as the first thing we go the other

553
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,890

554
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:33,009

walking chef past all the exploit and

555

562
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:08,230
programs and that's about another
fifteen percent i think we're pushing up
