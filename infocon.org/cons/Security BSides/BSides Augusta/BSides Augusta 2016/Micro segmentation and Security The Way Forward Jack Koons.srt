1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,340
okay good alright so i have the best
talk time because in about 30 minutes

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,030
we're gonna be going to get some
chick-fil-a so I say that to say this

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,020
anybody that wants to ask questions just
remember you're holding everybody else

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,730
up in here from getting three chick flat
right so that is my get-out-of-jail-free

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,760
card right and I didn't have to pay
anybody for that

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,900
so first off by way of introduction I'm
Jack Coonans I'm the speaker for the

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,320
next 30 minutes until august first of
this year i was a army officer over at

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Fort Gordon I mean what we now call the
17 series which is the cyber warfare

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,579
officers but i have about 15 to 20 years
of experience prior to that doing both

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,559
what we would refer to as intelligence
activities on net and then slowly

11
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,370
morphing to pass on and so i'll start
off with a real quick joke here to see

12
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:11,189
who gets it by the way what's the
difference between a computer networking

13
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:22,859
back right

14
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:35,460
you mess up rody apple red route fact
all of a sudden

15
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:47,399
yeah do that we're not doing computer
network attack not communicate or is

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,820
there

17
00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:00,320
question so the reason is that i don't
like I just like you

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,660
same thing with computer network
operations network administration lots

19
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:33,440
more and more people are shown here are
you form your life long last I heard the

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:47,690
previous speaker talked about second out
here in this room is what I'm talking

21
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,280
about something and actually very tired
first problem ability will report the

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:05,540
word and i have property gas so it's a
very easy place to be right now side of

23
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:21,950
my adult life and I want to access
sanctuary going on next to get lost

24
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:46,670
your price point to your house

25
00:03:50,540 --> 00:04:08,750
my voice is a world that little border
so now i'm outside outside not you use a

26
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:17,149
problem with another aspect which is one
of Hawaii event I know that could happen

27
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:27,049
potentially could happen and more
importantly he's so creepy 400 trust me

28
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:38,090
village that's not going to have any pot
serious because microcirculation in and

29
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,989
of itself kind of a boring subject but
it's so without further ado don't write

30
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:56,300
in here it is now I said I'm an e.r were
off by graduating has a cover another

31
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,300
name for right

32
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:16,460
he's going to get all this is a meeting
but however also always always use the

33
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:25,010
past month with the tool sets that have
been making that money putting hardware

34
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:37,789
on to network right old days are
preventing episode access that right

35
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:46,190
reality all day for a nation-state
literally leads of FTEs

36
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,170
full-time-equivalent right people
working game night various very very

37
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,390
clean conditions in America

38
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,430
let's just say the government can use
the phrase Kostas military right

39
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:08,510
switching schools that are failing at
our favorite do one special thing right

40
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:21,950
so let's go out there and a bored
teenager in out and fired out see will

41
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,830
have that's the new reality to run
operating right now it's my cock very

42
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:36,409
easy one for security in Europe because
everyone I don't have words

43
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:51,319
my couple things Internet of Things your
thing right understanding and in

44
00:06:51,319 --> 00:07:04,849
existence for possible descriptions for
nettles you make that happen very

45
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,330
worried client little bit

46
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:36,229
bility literally Louis Marlowe by walter
three all US law invited under the rest

47
00:07:36,229 --> 00:08:03,530
possibly just what microseconds so is
what you would a wide range of birth

48
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:53,860
for perspective someone not what and how
much damage in person conversation that

49
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:10,930
you have one wants to be sure that they
have want to make sure i'm going to keep

50
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:38,260
themselves and software-defined networks
so what I mean by it and

51
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,010
software-defined networks right and then
micro segmentation just like i said

52
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,240
earlier micro segmentation right this is
the world that we're living in right now

53
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,790
this is what literally is happening out
there and you guys are living like I was

54
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,790
going to jump into this is why we're
doing it right

55
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,420
no I'm not gonna bore you like this
morning you guys got to know what it is

56
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,579
what you want to do though and we'll
find you didn't install just basically

57
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,460
saying here is my dmz and therefore
everything inside my GMC I trust and

58
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,790
therefore it's allowed to move around
and do what he wants to do right

59
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,109
we call that as you guys know east-west
traffic we call that lateral movement

60
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,360
that's about depending on what is out
there in the world anywhere from sixty

61
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,110
to eighty percent of traffic inside the
data center not even look at because

62
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,390
they assumed to be trusted

63
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,720
right i will tell you in my world those
who think those are the next plane

64
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,070
ticket points occur

65
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,680
that's the point where you start having
people moving around outside threat this

66
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,449
could be inside and when I say threat
the threat to me is not some purpose

67
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,890
some purpose driven individual trying to
be bad days to your network and insider

68
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,290
threat to me some knucklehead doesn't
know whether to do it or just for one

69
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,670
day it is looking around things that are
not posted the guy in operations that so

70
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,760
we can get financial data the guy that's
in finance

71
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,870
it's looking at a chart and the person
that wants to know i'm making fifty

72
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,250
thousand dollars a year and i have one
with this I want to know how much is

73
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,390
made by the way we just got bonuses
right that kind of stuff we're talking

74
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,630
about here you want to get to is
something called zero trust and Trust

75
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:23,210
model which means literally every IP
packet inside of your world has to earn

76
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,770
the trust so for example I no longer
pocket Corey because Corey and I have

77
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,680
history i have to prove the quarry that
he and i can have a conversation

78
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,489
backboard so the way you want to get
like grapes and becomes a handshake

79
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:41,450
alright that's the old model little love
little FYI there

80
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,620
does everybody know what the purpose of
the motifs why do they have notes around

81
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,030
passes by the way everybody do you see
this all the time because there's one

82
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,810
place to get in one place to get out and
they're very well-defined places where

83
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,560
things are so for example the asylum
here with your HR data decide over here

84
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,529
maybe the financial dad street or on
accident

85
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:05,810
over there is an intellectual property
sitting over there and dob you can have

86
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,550
my supplied space you have something and
there's one way in one way out whether

87
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,209
finding the perimeter is nice and easily
understood what's the purpose of the

88
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:24,888
motel that very close for you I never
remember the beginning I said for you

89
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:40,550
and always right there my wallet gasps
questions that guy you recover right one

90
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,779
better think of the OSI model everybody
understand the OSI model right reference

91
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,209
that we all understand that we know what
this is about the actual reason that

92
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,339
boats were existing around these things
because people would cuddle me outside

93
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,170
him underneath the wall and the water in
the mode would actually flood the tunnel

94
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,000
that was the person mother now think of
the OSI model you got applications up

95
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,009
here right if I am really good at what
I'm doing I can keep diving into that

96
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,689
OSI model to get through your defenses
to the point where from and it's not me

97
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,990
but there are individuals out there that
literally in whom they can work on the

98
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,209
machine . language level and guess what

99
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:27,709
nothing stops they will literally crunch
through a grinder right the point to all

100
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,739
this is to reinforce the fact that in
this folder removing it as people get

101
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,480
more and more developed for having also
another little tribute guys know how the

102
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,439
stairs in the sink or there's always
going to certain direction because

103
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,829
typically held the store your spirit
your shield like this your sword like

104
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:47,179
this right so when you register is
coming up to get you what you do is you

105
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:51,649
force him to have to have his sword so
every stair an ancient castle will

106
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,790
collect it because what you do is you
keep this sword against the wall on the

107
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,110
guy protecting it

108
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,350
my sources with on the outside so I can
smack

109
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:10,720
it's nothing side right before taking
over you got 80 I keep budgets

110
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:23,079
parameters friends why because eating is
well understood . things you know like

111
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,790
I'm not a stripper

112
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,610
I possess not one certificate ready but
guess what I probably be able to get the

113
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:40,389
doctor explained i want Jane at 4 30
days to Jane Eyre double-check with how

114
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,819
does that relate my 30 days down in
Florida

115
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:48,878
how does that relate to somebody they
expected all right this is a beautiful

116
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:57,069
composition forget that's how we live
right now your question this i would

117
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,959
challenge anybody for no apparent reason
. tell me explain to show me in a visio

118
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,979
diagram physical and logical topology of
war network tell me which premiered

119
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,579
looks like tell me where the boundary is
on that map where it says here's the end

120
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:12,969
of my understanding and then there's
this ancient dragon city here be dragons

121
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,139
like some ancient and take pictures up
there i would challenge you to show me

122
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,220
that ok

123
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,779
you all know its shadow IITs everybody
here to shower ideas fight legacy boxes

124
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,559
shadow IT do that punch something in
just because something didn't work for

125
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:33,519
example this morning mr Joyce got from
tal could not get his computer so this

126
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,569
is a competition

127
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:37,628
you always liked but yet guess what he
got hooked up

128
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:40,149
how did he get hooked up because
somebody in the audience brought up a

129
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,540
cable and plug it in now i'm going to
tell you right now if I was somebody

130
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,410
that I to come here preloaded with my
thing with some firmware or something

131
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,069
sitting on that thing and I would have
given it to the guy on CL to plug into

132
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,269
his box so that he can plug it in to get
your bonus right this is the way the

133
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,139
adversary

134
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,800
alright so appointed

135
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,099
this is our role right we gotta get
started what Snowden devastating right

136
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,990
what made him devastate the ability for
him to get inside and basically have a

137
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,190
whole lot of everything look around
outside dallas now yes he used

138
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,640
credentials from other people . some of
these but the fact is he was able to

139
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,930
move around inside your network that's
the ultimate insider threat but it could

140
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,819
have been another so the the threat may
not have been different ever Snowden the

141
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,149
threat really was the individual to let
him use his identification cards

142
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,800
potential it that's the threat right for
you one of them use my confusion around

143
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,890
you guys have all seen is everyone
familiar with the kill chain right it's

144
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,920
out there you can do the research on
this is a kill Cain is actually a new

145
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,120
version of this the expanded several
changes parts about Star Trek here is

146
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,750
the most network administrators don't
have the time the money the patience or

147
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,970
the visibility to look at that very one
sided what they consider to be their

148
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,810
network right micro segmentation can
help that that's the area that my

149
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,020
research that's what I'm looking at
because it's very it's a very rich vein

150
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,699
and a lot of companies are looking at it
right now but for here's how it works

151
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,990
and by the way part of it is probably
happy out of my senior couple things

152
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,829
three ways of looking at the world today
you have permanent sites right

153
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,839
companies like they don't want to put
anything anywhere else

154
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,168
lock it down no all financial
transactions right here or all of my IT

155
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:33,240
right here so i wouldn't even look at
that gas every day then there are some

156
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,230
my column cloud babies there are people
that literally going to amazon AWS they

157
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,059
go out pretty fucking startup i'm
basically going to go shopping I'm going

158
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,160
to get some server time I'm gonna get
some security don't like shopping with a

159
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,970
check it out and guess what there's no
physical representations company they're

160
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,780
literally of the cloud border plot
centers highbridge what most companies

161
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,520
including intelligence agencies
including pretty much everybody right

162
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,780
now is leaking this hybrid model right
so those are your three models that

163
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,770
third hybrid model you have a permanent
facility where they make you control

164
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,080
their idea is

165
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,550
makes me feel better but yet they have
mobile device injuries that are all over

166
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,389
the place and they want to be able to
give them real time your real-time

167
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,060
access to things like app for example
office 365 why what why on earth would I

168
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,100
wanted to lose my network administrators
and having to deal with all that crap on

169
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,810
what I want to focus on which is taking
my IP so I'm going to host basically 510

170
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,830
and pilot and let that application my
back foot that Microsoft web that's the

171
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,620
hybrid mouth right but those three
things are what's going on right here

172
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,300
and that's what you're going to see here

173
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,010
so what we have you guys can read by the
way it slides and i'm not going to talk

174
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,640
to the slides slides these are here for
you if you want afterwards you can go

175
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,450
back and correct but basically this is
what we do right by her Kate you segment

176
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,920
all the stuff up here and then you can
easily divide this is really nothing but

177
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,600
I want you to get your head wrapped
around this and do this already today

178
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,050
what we're trying to do right now and
what companies are doing right now is

179
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,760
they are literally encrypting a packet
level relationship news of interest

180
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,480
back-and-forth going to go through a
couple things here so this is exactly

181
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,660
people sort of it's right there is a use
case out there you guys can do the

182
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:30,560
researchers use case right now we're a
company i cannot a state a US state went

183
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,050
from well over a hundred thousand
capital right exactly right the the

184
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,120
definitely the the shipment that singers
put the natural ACL you went and

185
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,610
collapse that from over a hundred
thousand to about a hundred by using

186
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,409
micro segmentation right that's why
Michael micro segmentation powerful and

187
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,190
by combining micro segmentation with
Software Defined networks think about it

188
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,970
like this for the software-defined
Network you can roll out in a matter of

189
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,970
minutes something that you could never
do hardware because what happens with

190
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,740
our look what do you do with hard work

191
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:08,420
second you have to go and place it so if
your company or you have a global

192
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,920
workforce you have to install a firewall
you now have incurred logistical cost

193
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,210
I've gotta go in place my cisco pizza
box it's sitting on a rack somewhere in

194
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,789
a closet you have to physically go there
.

195
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,908
place right start with my homework

196
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:25,609
you don't have to do that you get away
from a lot of stuff so you get a

197
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:31,939
cost-saving down there which is very
interesting one

198
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,399
okay so bottom line with this is already
doing things like a career already doing

199
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:41,539
things like elder are you doing things
in DoD like you know the other thing I

200
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:45,619
get to the five minutes in itself i'm
going to do something the farm through

201
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,840
here real quick so here's three use
cases that we've got no not right we

202
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,809
have intellectual property on the top is
the challenge on the bottom is what

203
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,599
happens in your local segmentation so
we've already talked about intellectual

204
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,259
property rights you have access for
gadgets right

205
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,070
the problem is everything that you
wanted to have a software-defined

206
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,779
networks and micro segmentation you can
use advanced photography we talk about

207
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:13,039
250 sixth-grade to military grade
encryption like that protects create

208
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,749
those tunnels and only allow those
communities of interest to go here's the

209
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:19,429
kicker is really easy part

210
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:25,220
there are companies out there right now
that are literally using shit to layer 3

211
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,690
so this is not something that Jack is
talking to you about that in the to be

212
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,309
future this is happening right now what
they do is they put ash in education in

213
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:39,649
between layer 2 and layer 3 that ship
basically looks like for example the

214
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:48,830
important for you to send me there are
not assigned I won't even respond or off

215
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:54,470
the pats so what why is that powerful
what does that do like it denies the

216
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,820
adversary believe in that and understand
the network in a dungeon crawler screams

217
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:06,320
it's not like song and effectively
closed and darkening the end notes or

218
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,428
the actual things that you don't want
them to have optimization to write and

219
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,909
so really a network administrator is the
only one with harry potter marauders map

220
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:17,629
right that's the only thing and that is
where you focus all of your resources to

221
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,988
protect the Marauder's Map you don't
waste your money out there protecting

222
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,939
more parameters challenges understand
what it looks like i'm trying to burn

223
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,630
through here and like devices for
example everybody works in couples

224
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,630
supported anymore

225
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,520
I you know you're not gonna do you're
not going to turn it up and place it was

226
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,720
probably still wanted and you may not
even know where it right not going to

227
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,500
turn it off

228
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,590
so you've got an end-of-life device
sitting out there not supported that

229
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,610
patch right so you can basically circle
that thing and you can segment that

230
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,949
thing off of something else right so
when you're doing it in that show again

231
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,790
that simple

232
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,620
this this makes it look like this .
every cut that wouldn't you wouldn't you

233
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,580
doing really cool with micro
segmentation talk more offline about

234
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,428
this you're doing things want to reduce
tax service it presented the episode

235
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,690
when I say adversary I talk about
everybody company that i work for that

236
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:22,460
it's not for security side to as well as
everybody outside of the right to reduce

237
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,809
the attack service repair also in the
business world ends with you I never had

238
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,629
to worry about before it's very
apparently very current important

239
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:34,400
commercial center you reduce the default
or audit and with regulatory service

240
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
right so you have a credit card
information flows across the entire

241
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,280
network is what has to be given the
chance to get bodied constantly the

242
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,530
entire freaking out right

243
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,710
what did you can segment that my first
segment that a cryptid so that's a

244
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,400
financial data flows around here in all
of the transport all the infrastructure

245
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,150
that supports it is segmented all bleep
ripped away from it which is what

246
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,480
companies are moving through right now
just what is what doesn't get a lot of

247
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,429
the ninety percent that makes it
happened

248
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:08,159
it started in with that so let's start
to see the cost and going through here

249
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,029
because I want to get through because
look at that that's it because I wanted

250
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:16,619
free of fire here how much time I have
for questions thanks we got about five

251
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:19,709
minutes for questions or anybody besides
story and walling it has a question

252
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,320
yeah really

253
00:24:26,190 --> 00:25:02,490
giveaways are connecting yeah so yeah
but they're set but not just stop

254
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:12,840
it's about 67 microsoft there right much
about the publisher and right now I

255
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,149
don't want this to yourself picking
because I didn't join microsoft i'm not

256
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,979
going to simply i'm here with these
interested in micro segmentation attacks

257
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,429
using metrics and also by taxpayers I
want to remove the adversary published

258
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:34,049
by the way was still but it also does is
even if someone were to come in and

259
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:41,249
around micro segmentation but literally
putting us bien fight you want to agree

260
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:46,649
with the princes getting out because it
will allow eating out perfect so the

261
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:50,039
matter will not be able to go outside
network will still be alive but it will

262
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,059
be able to touch me full server it will
be able excellent

263
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:58,789
yeah so lets you go back to Bruges all
360 what that really does to go in now

264
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:02,210
to change the paradigm but you're not
going into this but how do I protect

265
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,269
everything everything from everybody

266
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,230
what you do is go in with understanding
it will probably get going to take it

267
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,799
back all time so we're going to do is
we're going to physically and logically

268
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,120
choose where we want to assume risk and
then a lie all the other hardware

269
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,748
against what we you know what to do
rather than put quality sensors

270
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:40,460
everything out where we don't know
you're never coming you're talking about

271
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:47,809
but going further you're all like doing
all along without operating system

272
00:27:15,149 --> 00:28:06,718
why our model is going so where you get
around while be is with software its

273
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:48,119
offer basically agreed to the left so
again apologize for the shortness that

274
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,789
this is what they call a lightning so
you're getting about six months of

275
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,239
research in about 30 minutes appreciate
your time for your questions in with the

276
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,129
afterwards thank you
