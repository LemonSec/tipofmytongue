1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,610
autism program sheet there always is
usually thursday so if you wanna roll

2
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,799
Wow big crap Pickers last talk today
hope everybody's had a wonderful day I

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,279
certainly have a few tops got a few
buttons up front

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,840
that's good lunch so it's been a good
day as we jump into this talk a little

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,500
bit about me my first foray into your
programming was similar to duck i'm not

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,410
actually mode yards about commodore
vic-20 at age 13 I started writing a

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,370
basic hopes and peace for loops and go
to use I have lots to go to his back

8
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,358
then i would hope I'm past that at this
point but after i graduated from college

9
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,310
and its markings a system administrator
then I moved on into true software

10
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,770
development riding in knr see which you
might want to remember that for later on

11
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,780
then into java and I did some 8086
assembly 6502 assembly and some 370

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,350
assembly on the thing I'm probably the
most proud of this picture is the bottom

13
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,220
corner that's be playing beach
volleyball with my two children who are

14
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,020
probably both in high school and both
participating in the Air Force cyber

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,110
defense competition this year and they
were both in last year my daughter being

16
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,460
a senior will be a team captain this
year which is awesome and our high

17
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,250
schools put together four teams you know
I do work from home for four fire i

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,780
mentioned that for my boss is looking
for me and I'm just happen to be away

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,460
from keyboard my dog there takes care of
my keyboard for me and you know punching

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:13,239
once in awhile so so quickly jinda state
software what la angel

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,190
I don't fall into the trap that we're
talking about then we'll look at some

22
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,960
ways to fix it all

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,860
throw a conclusion out there i'll ask
you guys for questions and then I've got

24
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:33,010
a couple of really nice giveaways to do
at the end so you guys are here so you

25
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,220
obviously understand the scope of
software software is everywhere

26
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,430
dozens and dozens of operating systems
hundreds of programming languages are

27
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,470
thousands of professional software
developers summer really good and some

28
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,750
are not hundreds of thousands of
applications billions millions even

29
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:59,380
billions bonds poker games who likes to
play games right

30
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,760
I your entertainment we all have netflix
we all have no higher tivo some people

31
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,620
have tivo some are still people are
still at arbonne are you do your taxes

32
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,120
online you pay your taxes online it's in
healthcare everywhere you got software

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,810
controlling on harmonica tourism things
like that in the energy sector you have

34
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,190
applications go out and see how much
electricity you could use and pull it

35
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,859
back so you don't have the guys running
around checking the meters on the

36
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,340
twenty-third of the month anymore which
is job my father actually did well in

37
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,560
transportation all seen the videos from
defcon people hacking into cars and turn

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,600
off the ABS system all the moving

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,030
it's just everywhere and along with that
everywhere there's problems see that

40
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,230
this number came from the National these
numbers came from the National

41
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,720
vulnerability database number of
reported problems with software that

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,190
we're going you know this is
vulnerabilities so it's gone up although

43
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,900
i'm happy to say that in $MONTH 2015 if
you're down a little bit but still the

44
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,740
the number went down the costs went up
on

45
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,959
hanuman Institute reported that the cost
of cybercrime was up almost twenty

46
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,400
percent in $MONTH 2015 federal
government has also passed legislation

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,299
holding companies liable for not
protecting their electronic records

48
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,390
under the Obama care if you're not
taking care of your records and you get

49
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,340
hacks ten thousand dollars per record
for every person's record to be

50
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,770
compromised and there's also civil
liability that top couple doors down

51
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,500
earlier where they mentioned that one
large retailer had multiple lawsuits

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,510
possible breach they had a couple years
ago so I'm just the fact that you have

53
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:01,280
to defend yourself in court and you have
to get yourself on network plus I think

54
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,299
we can all agree

55
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,560
compliance is not equal security PCI
compliant does not mean that you're

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,030
secure means your attacks are smaller
but it doesn't mean that you're secure

57
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:21,890
on federal agencies i work for the dod
for six years now you have died cab its

58
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,780
cap FedRAMP FISMA all those are just
check boxes if all you're doing is

59
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,780
checking the checkboxes you're not doing
it right

60
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:40,640
so any developers in room 1 and I ask
what language

61
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:54,289
and if you worked in an agile
development environment for gossip I had

62
00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:00,949
that on the personal uh so for those of
you who who haven't heard might not be

63
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,749
super familiar with it i'll do a really
quick run three armed and you actually

64
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:14,029
begin eighties still in high school at
that time you had waterfall and you had

65
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:19,550
from the villain side of it from the
process out of it you know somebody

66
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,020
would come up with an idea

67
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,039
somebody with storyboarding that they
handoff the idea storyboarded out they

68
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,029
handed off to the developers who get it
done then go to the testers and textures

69
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,529
to check it and you have a loop there we
go back and forth a few times and then

70
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:37,669
eventually sometimes five years later
you actually get something out the door

71
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:48,349
that people were using as agile as it
born back in on you don't really pass it

72
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:55,219
from team to team anymore its organic as
soon as i get a little piece of code

73
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:59,719
ready i handed off to the tester and all
goes through it but the pretty much the

74
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:08,719
same time he the idea is by keeping a
team together and keep focused talk

75
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:15,649
about more minute you can do things
faster and more efficiently but will

76
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,659
argue more efficiently in a few minutes

77
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:24,050
palm several agile methodologies through
in software development community street

78
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,599
extreme programming scribe adaptive
software development crystal featured

79
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,969
giving driven development pragmatic
programming that the people and lots

80
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:43,759
more on in 2001 groups from different
agile programming disciplines came

81
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,759
together came up with the agile
manifesto

82
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:57,420
maybe you could give us a little bit of
that it's been a long time I but the

83
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:05,820
idea was to develop software in a way
that meets your environment not

84
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:16,050
necessarily having a cookie cutter way
handling it off from shop to shop move a

85
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,270
little further forward here on agile
development was added to the project

86
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:29,640
manager book of knowledge in 2013
practiced by many organizations all over

87
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,098
the world so if you look at fire is
doing it

88
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,560
microsoft does it as far as agile
development goes even in our retailers

89
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:50,910
yogurt and just for reference if you
wanted to go get your PMP certification

90
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,500
and agile development the average
starting salary in Georgia is about

91
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:05,640
86,000 dollars a year for a net for a
PMP certified as a project manager so so

92
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,939
now is a guy like to say that wraps it
can see the spotter where there lots of

93
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,410
commercial and government agencies and
falling in so

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:25,020
so we all have ideas I've had ideas from
the time I was a kid things I would like

95
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,400
to do so the idea with agile teams is
somebody comes up with an idea

96
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,800
you handed to an agile team they go off
and do what they do they have something

97
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,180
production radiant bring it back to you
on it does have some advantages glass

98
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,120
half full guy asking you to gather work
with his developers more visibility and

99
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,970
control project they're running the show

100
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,610
good or bad to run the show on and by
empowering the team you're hoping to

101
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:02,700
harness the entrepreneurial spirit Apple
did this back in the early nineties

102
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,370
ladies early nineties hand team project
it if the project took off and did

103
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,620
really well they were very much rewarded
for if they weren't then if you want

104
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,550
they weren't never applied for
unemployment in san jose other

105
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,339
advantages the idea is to set a
sustainable pace

106
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,960
we've all been through up my exams
coming up

107
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,280
got it gotta cram for it that study for
got a deadline gotta hustle hustle

108
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,920
the idea is break it up into chunks that
are manageable and medial and you

109
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,569
actually deliver stuff on time and
encourage developers to meet commitments

110
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,150
cause they are committing to what they
agree manageable amount of work over a

111
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:54,449
given period of time on it also focuses
on the stakeholders give you constant

112
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,850
organization today you're trying to
develop something to detect

113
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:10,960
catalog and then all of a sudden that
that piece of malware disappears then it

114
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,760
might get the prioritize that you had
finished developing here and then the

115
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,990
last bullet there as you supposed to
deliver production-ready these

116
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,890
developments and we'll talk about that a
little bit disadvantages

117
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,250
so give a little bit more about my
experience working with scrum teams on 2

118
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:39,220
comments are both here in North America
commercial and government

119
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,570
I'll see very mature teams of developers
who then you know 10 15 years in

120
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,790
business 20 years in the business on
when the entire teams that way or fast

121
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,010
Georgie the teams at Lake are usually
very successful if you take a group of

122
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,620
developers less than five years of
experience each arm throw them into an

123
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,000
environment like this you're going to
spend a lot of money and you're gonna

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,950
get a lot of nothing one other thing is
agile teams don't hear you have a system

125
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,480
architect wall you don't have somebody
who's looking at the whole picture which

126
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,630
is very very important so you cannot
very quickly become too focused and

127
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,850
forget the fact that you need to update
the backend processes are changing UI

128
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,210
and you end up with problems and
production because you deliver

129
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:43,360
production area code are another thing
is if your stakeholders are

130
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,800
argumentative and shuffle priorities
drastically with every spring it can

131
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,240
quickly become whack-a-mole

132
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,140
oh we got this bug that's immediately
the highest priority let's break this

133
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,100
brand huddle up

134
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,100
start over you can just like with the
intelligence beads and alerts can

135
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,320
quickly become like them all home

136
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,150
it's so focused on short successes that
you can lose your long-term vision I

137
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,290
gets a little bit of work done i get
patted on the back i get this little

138
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,319
piece of work done and I get paid on the
back of this little piece of work done i

139
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,600
get back on the back but the thing that
i missed was this little piece of work

140
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,840
to be here this will this work with me
here but I wanted to go over there so it

141
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,810
cannot it truly requires strong project
management strong leadership and the

142
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,219
stakeholders have to agree on a
direction for whatever your building

143
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,130
it's not going to work um the other
thing is you're always focused on

144
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,560
short-term successes there seems to be a
tendency for developers to just grab

145
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,790
whatever the flavor of the day is that
will do most of what they want to do

146
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:05,719
right short augmentation for it and now
and then push it out the door so that

147
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:13,160
they meet their deadlines the the good
side of that is to collaborate bats out

148
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,280
of that is on not all of these libraries
and very well tested from a functional

149
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:28,250
or from a security standpoint on the
other piece of it i'm on top more on the

150
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,470
next slide is easy to swallow individual
team members when the teams are not

151
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,720
located so pair programming goes out the
window when you've got guys in for six

152
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,210
time zones apart on which is where i was
with managing teams in Europe when I

153
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:55,340
lived in Iran little bit more into the
disadvantages you're trying to build a

154
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,450
functional team you can feel
production-ready code with a group of

155
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,930
five to seven individuals are it really

156
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:10,510
really requires strong multi-discipline
backgrounds need to have a successful

157
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,540
team and got seven people you've got to
have an architect have functional tester

158
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,240
you gotta load tester you've got to have
a lead developer you have a couple of

159
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,600
developers gotta have somebody can be a
security assessor uh usually you need

160
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,130
somebody to do in test if you're going
to be doing any serious releases and you

161
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,990
need somebody who can build the platform
from the work on and you only have seven

162
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,900
people and you can kill your project for
two weeks I want to take my kid is so

163
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,670
you really need people who can reach
across multi-discipline and are willing

164
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:56,079
to do so I've seen teams fail epically
they had a developer who also knew how

165
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,120
to work on the platform but he said I
used to do that now I don't want to do

166
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,590
is write code so when the platform
needed to fix the guy who's better at it

167
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:14,230
was away nothing will work and this is
my favorite one

168
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:23,230
my absolute favorite fallacy of agile
development defining done so you doing

169
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,120
window you get a four-week window

170
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:36,820
whatever happens to be one day window
your delivery production-ready code what

171
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,440
defines done is it done when you get
when it actually composite developers

172
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,920
desktop now because it develop is it
done when you complete functional

173
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:56,050
testing know what about documentation
internal documentation so that the

174
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,880
operation people for it

175
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,230
what about external documentation so
that other people who are actually

176
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,230
buying this product can actually use it

177
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,459
did you do any security testing did you
do any low test you don't know exactly

178
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:18,119
what frame person's gonna be running it
on here on what seems to happen with

179
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:23,069
done is they do say it's done soon as it
finishes functional testing and then

180
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,799
after the spring is over they'll add a
week of load testing we can security

181
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,429
testing a week for documentation we in
staging in another way to roll outs and

182
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:41,609
by the time it actually rolls out
they've completed two more Sprint's and

183
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:48,899
how everybody behind the chain is behind
so your documentation is weeks behind

184
00:17:48,899 --> 00:18:00,869
production-ready so I said I'm an
optimist going to talk about fixing the

185
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:04,738
most important priority as far as I'm
concerned being a project manager

186
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:10,289
multiple teams and one going being a
developer at one point and now being on

187
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:18,899
the security side of the house builder
team extremely careful agile evangelist

188
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:23,488
will preach that changing your team
anytime during the life cycle of the

189
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:28,590
product has been passed to three springs
reestablishing velocity i can guarantee

190
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:35,789
you that a security breach or non lo
tested code is going to cost you a lot

191
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:42,359
more than three springs will throw
targets name out on out on the table

192
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:42,840
here

193
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,840
what did it cost them the breach that
they had and they're still paying for it

194
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:58,109
on 67 guys you can't have more than one
kid fresh out of college

195
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:04,949
you can't do it there's just not enough
even if you guys you know move to

196
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,879
Antarctica living in an igloo it's been
24 hours a day together building

197
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,049
whatever this is

198
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,830
if you've got more than 1i an
experienced guy

199
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,830
it's too much weight to pull for the
rest of the team actually successful

200
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,500
it's just not going to happen and then
the last piece here is team stability is

201
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,030
not greater than skill mix if you're
trying to if you've got a team and

202
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,170
they've been assigned a project and the
project direction changes a little bit

203
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,470
now you need somebody with some
networking background or now you need

204
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,710
somebody with hunting experience if
you're doing it's not necessarily

205
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,500
software development you're working on
the three Sprint's to re-establish a

206
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:57,460
steady velocity and make your mix of
skills correct take the guy who is not

207
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,260
fight skill sets that you want moving to
another team bring in the guys got skill

208
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,260
set that you want because if you don't
you're gonna regret it

209
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,920
the other side of that is are you
talking about having experienced

210
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:21,640
developers agile teams are treated like
startups there was a quote from IBM in

211
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,830
the early nineties that's it

212
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,889
we have no idea what they're doing

213
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,770
you just know they're going to build
something you give them a bunch of money

214
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:37,780
and they bring something back arm even
very mature developers are not

215
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:44,560
necessarily motivated to do that so
responsibility chart up there

216
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,530
I've actually had that hanging in my
cube and had people ask me to take it

217
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,310
down

218
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,550
ah but it's important

219
00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:01,360
commit to what you're going to do then
do what you committed to on

220
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:12,250
or close the great great player can top
the top wall along with that every team

221
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,950
member contributes directly to success

222
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,420
you got to remember that it's not
pulling their weight go to the collabnet

223
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,010
documentation for certified scrummaster
they encourage the other team members to

224
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:33,610
encourage pull on everything short of
ostracize 14-member to get them to

225
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,649
actually hold her way you gotta do it if
you've got a bunch of

226
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,190
non-confrontational people that have
experienced and you got one guy who's

227
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,180
not pulling his weight i'm here in
trouble goes back to building your team

228
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:54,730
carefully and on the project that i'm
currently working on the third bullet is

229
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,780
probably one of the biggest pain points
in my life

230
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,980
the team will accept a hundred and
twenty points where the work and they

231
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,340
know they can only do 60 but they still
accept all this into this into their

232
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:19,959
sprints and then they don't make I've
got to go back to the customer on the

233
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,880
other end and say for the stakeholders
or whoever happens to be and say you

234
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,120
know we were really trying to get that
feature out to you this quarter but it

235
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,020
didn't happen when it happens two or
three quarters in the road becomes a

236
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,930
real sore spot for her for the customers
and for the people who have to break so

237
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,090
committed to what you can do then the
bottom . is actually

238
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,190
collaboration talking about multi
functional discipline our

239
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:02,150
multi-discipline personnel they need to
communicate about everything on the

240
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,150
second bullet as pair programming is not
just about you

241
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:13,550
I sorry im a jak certified secure
programmer I look at things differently

242
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,700
than the guy who's got the CIS degree in
10 years of software development

243
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:28,760
experience i turning out code for
brochure where when he looks in my code

244
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:36,830
he's going to look at different things
than I look at my look is its it teaches

245
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:44,600
it helps each team member become more
multi-discipline just can't i can't say

246
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,949
enough about I could spend two hours
talking about just that the other thing

247
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,440
is the next thing on the list stand-ups
are not optional and require details for

248
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:06,050
several months at team member who came
into one of the scrum meetings and he

249
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:11,360
said oh I'm working on integrating
single sign-on into this dismiss it's

250
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:20,270
always write every day for three months
on me and I went back and fix it but I

251
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:27,379
need you need to come into your
stand-ups every day is as described on

252
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,120
time pass the ball around say what you
gotta say given up details to know that

253
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,530
if you do need help people who were
there it might be able to help you can

254
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,600
step up and help you right away you're
trying to develop products as if you

255
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,629
were a start-up and get out the door you
can't

256
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:54,409
you can't just hold information to
yourself stakeholders involved if

257
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,489
something changes they need to get
involved right away and at the end of

258
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:02,899
every sprint they need to check out the
work that was done and accepted and

259
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:09,469
reprioritize as quickly as possible so
you can get the next print started if

260
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,690
you don't keep up with rebar closet

261
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:18,769
we're not going to end up over there
were going somewhere out and don't be

262
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:27,529
tempted to single out team members house
of specials as I said security plus GX

263
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,549
certified secure programmer but I
shouldn't be the only one who's doing

264
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:37,700
security assessments on the software the
teams but together if you do that and I

265
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:50,960
win the lottery teams immediately and
one more thought on that one before I

266
00:25:50,960 --> 00:26:01,220
move on there's a one particular team
member of bonds i said i would mention

267
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,759
at some point during the stop so that
you have to actually listen to the Holy

268
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,759
so George buddy this 13

269
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:19,759
alright so everybody's heard this
military time keep it simple sign modern

270
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,549
applications have dozens of moving parts
databases got some stuff you've got an

271
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,210
operating system you've got an
application platform got a front in

272
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,700
doing a model view controller you can
have that and actually multiple

273
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:43,580
languages you can have qs for handling
load but as mr. on so eloquently said

274
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,809
hear everything should be made as simple
as possible but not simpler

275
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:57,700
along with that I have another quote
love to put in at this point says there

276
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,930
are two ways in truck constructing the
software design one way is to make it so

277
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,160
simple but there are obviously no
deficiencies and the other is to make it

278
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,700
so complicated that there are are no
obvious deficiencies the first man that

279
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,290
is far more difficult when you pass it
off your operations people you pass it

280
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:25,210
off your customers who are actually
using it home it works if you make it so

281
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,630
complicated that nobody can understand
it there's a very high probability that

282
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:40,360
nobody can actually understand your
risks understand what you're building

283
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,120
you've handed the upper management has
handed the keys kingdom to the

284
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:53,290
development team or the security
operation see you doing software

285
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,800
development know your applications know
where they are know what's supposed to

286
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,110
be there at the same thing you hear
about networks

287
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:13,060
oh I didn't know that router was over
there sending SNMP data to Beijing or I

288
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,300
didn't know that firewall was configured
to allow all ports out there

289
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
and software oh I didn't know this guy
was using go

290
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:30,650
he was using a version it's like two
years old goes around know your

291
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,710
environment test environment pissed off
every build should kick off some

292
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,820
automated testing every hatch should
kick off on a larger set of testing

293
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,040
every release should kick off an even
bigger some another thing tension

294
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:58,159
third-party solutions the example that I
loved to use struts and struts came out

295
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,190
there was some example code to show you
how to put together your view controller

296
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:11,210
really really quick but it had across
process scripting flaw in the example I

297
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,440
can count

298
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,680
dozens of applications that up that I've
worked on

299
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:22,160
I've been to that actually copy and
paste this example code into their view

300
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,090
and now you have cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities in your production

301
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:33,230
application and it takes like 90 seconds
to test it and find it so you've got a

302
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,500
taste for third-party solutions in
addition to what you're working on

303
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:46,250
trying your development team as i said
earlier that the jack secure software

304
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:53,000
program it's no joke it's a hard test
study for it for a couple weeks and I

305
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,920
was to renew it so I already got it once
it's been a couple weeks studied for it

306
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,320
going through the materials again it
still was hard and that's what you need

307
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,669
you need something to make these guys
think not only about this little piece

308
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,390
of code that are writing within the
piece of code that's running on this

309
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:17,510
application server that's running on
this network it's on available to this

310
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,800
environment even if the environment
you're talking about is your customers

311
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,330
are think about how they're going to use
it about how they're going to use it

312
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,649
so that you don't end up with something
that you could very easily taken care of

313
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:41,030
and have to rush out patches or give
somebody some money back or even worse

314
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:46,850
have your name and your company's name
spread all over the news and the

315
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:56,270
internet and Twitter and everything else
the last piece there is gotta have your

316
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,330
stakeholders scrum master your project
manager all going to sit down together

317
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:10,100
and work out reduce your risks where it
makes sense if you're working on a piece

318
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:20,629
of software that's on going to be in a
car has absolutely no external network

319
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,710
connections

320
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:28,730
maybe you don't have to worry so much
about SH not being patched on but if

321
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:37,220
that same issue is on our Wi-Fi router
that's sitting on a hospital's Network

322
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,260
that has connections to all the other
devices and that's probably going to be

323
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:55,280
a much higher priority so sisters if
anybody has any questions for me at this

324
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,280
point you have a little more content and
take a break here get your breath

325
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,400
anybody have any questions

326
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,320
please

327
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:41,820
having just a little trouble here you
actually got a lot of suggestions

328
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:52,740
oh so you can see anybody from his
company in here but Tim Tom's doesn't

329
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,840
really really great web application
testing horse

330
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:08,040
ok so that's the longer developer course
that's four days I think it's actually

331
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,980
amazing to get this year actually just
as a refresher course for myself and not

332
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,060
have been doing web development but it
gave me on the detection side of the

333
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,340
house and gave me some more things to
look for

334
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,340
so I was looking at it from that side

335
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:32,820
another thing is the the GX pure Java
programmer if you doing stuff in java or

336
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:41,159
they also have the ASPCA sharp version
of it is amazing absolutely amazing and

337
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,300
afterwards you can get the certification
which is good for four years and you can

338
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,190
review it again for another four years
which is what i just did it will make

339
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,620
you think about it and they look at it
from both a java platform or sharp

340
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,580
platform and at the web platform so
there was tons of questions in there

341
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:07,919
about how to close known vulnerabilities
in tomcat jboss and is you're on the

342
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,000
other side of it

343
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,350
so those are

344
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:17,650
things that can do it and other things
if you've got access to somebody who's

345
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:24,310
in tester read some of the books in
theory I don't have any names right off

346
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,699
the top of my head like even my car

347
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:34,720
send me an email I can definitely do
some suggestions with applications

348
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,929
hacker's handbook is a good thank you
James

349
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:49,719
ah so lots of lots of information out
there the biggest thing is pick your

350
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,759
platform whether it be on them

351
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,640
microsoft side of the house or the java
side of the house or PHP or whatever it

352
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,400
happens to be and then focus there
because there's so much information

353
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,490
it'll seem like diving into an ocean if
you look if you try to attack on more

354
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,169
than one platform at the time so pick a
platform the concepts are going to be

355
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,540
the same just pick up the syntax when
you go to the next one so that's my best

356
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:25,600
advice pick one key to it and the
concepts of caring as long as your crew

357
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:37,509
goes so i dunno some credit around lots
of

358
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,030
recommendations there about the numbers
of the front the picture from my fellow

359
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:52,170
Americans happens to be one of my top
five favorite comedies which was found

360
00:35:52,170 --> 00:36:11,130
about three hours away from here i'll
mention the how Apple does it that's

361
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:18,960
where the one of the quotes can prompt
it that are red in the bottom there we

362
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,400
were talking about targets and there's
the CNN article about target on these

363
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,730
slides are going to be up on the b-sides
website so going to try to write

364
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:34,770
anything down or take a picture this
article the second one out here the one

365
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:40,200
from security week is actually another
good place to get started seven

366
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,839
considerations to reduce your attack
surface and a wasp has a ton of

367
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,619
information out there if you're on it
doesn't matter what side of the house

368
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:58,260
round pick one then not finally thank
you guys for hanging around four o'clock

369
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,990
at the end on Thank You b-sides guests
for allowing me to speak with this great

370
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,000
polo

371
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,190
thank you to pinterest fell for talking
me into submitting my first see me last

372
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,480
year

373
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,410
Thank You fire out to be up to you to
have the day off yesterday to go to

374
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,529
security any conference can be here
today and then of course the big thank

375
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:30,630
you to scope on that happen to be happy
to assist put together logos down in the

376
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,450
bottom corner there so I nobody's
thought of any more questions I've got a

377
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,049
couple of the items here to give away

378
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:43,890
last call for questions

379
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:55,319
so southward has given this great
lockpicks it for me to give away so I

380
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:04,079
back my very first are on my agenda
slide I had a line that says don't fall

381
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,549
into the track from the movie my fellow
Americans you can finish the Senate

382
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:20,730
hopeful don't fall into the trap body
people he pulls the string out the

383
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,059
presidential doll don't fall into the
trap

384
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:43,230
nobody alright alright I'm going to tell
you the answer probably in the given

385
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,940
political climate is probably the wrong
thing to say but it's don't fall into

386
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,940
the trap Democrats are full of great

387
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:56,038
ah let's see another good question

388
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:09,869
who can remember what my first computer
was right here Commodore vic-20 yes sir

389
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:30,859
for the hacker playbook which was
graciously donated besides the vessel

390
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:40,730
he's just going on mom

391
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:51,200
we'll see if anybody remember two of the
processors that i wrote assembly

392
00:39:51,200 --> 00:40:03,560
language for there were three or
multiple about one about yes sir
