1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
ids choices so it is the mic on

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,540
I don't know i know it is known that
that would be a good thing that you are

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:21,840
ok how about now is that better

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,439
alright library actually now we're in
working order her so now that everybody

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,619
can actually hear what I'm saying
welcome

6
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,350
ah has said my name is forgotten or
Brian I talking about some IDs choices

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,710
and networks and network architecture i
sell little bit history slightly jaded

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,149
on ids kind of started at Sourcefire so
little bit of love for snort and

9
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,559
hopefully those people know it and ids
is hopefully yes no maybe

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,789
ok some of you anyway

11
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:10,740
all right arm so along the way i ended
up taking over a few things so running a

12
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,899
nice little CTF and running another
b-sides up in Maryland and hackerspace

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,689
and other strange things along the way
pretty much my entire career has been

14
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,059
around the sock world and defensive
architecture so that's been kind of fun

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,869
last soccer worked in we actually
combined these two things

16
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,030
does anyone know roughly what left is
supposed to represent plc industrial

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,119
control systems so i actually had the
pleasure of building probably one of the

18
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,189
first industrial control systems
security operation centers designed

19
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,029
around specifically monitoring a series
of power grids of power distribution

20
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,159
transmission and getting innocent
generations that was kind of fun lots of

21
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,250
interesting environment step snort in
arm now I end up the teaching folks

22
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,130
about norton sock work as well as
teaching a lovely class up in Maryland

23
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:20,269
and under . 3 so we end up teaching
water classes and allocated his hacker

24
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,240
spaces and free classes are always good
so I one more things over the years you

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,410
kind of put together the faces of sock
monitoring kind of the current status

26
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:41,359
quo a lot of socks I've walked into have
been somewhere around fat wailing kind

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,420
of sad but organizations tend to look at

28
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,869
ok we have tickets we need to close
tickets were getting alerts we don't

29
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,100
know what these mean we get more alerts
then we can deal with so we're going to

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:03,470
rush to close every single ticket we can
in not much thought of actually what can

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,570
we do to prevent these alerts in the
future lot of times like these issues

32
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,430
don't get fixed don't get addressed

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,070
no one's looking at how do we deal with
this problem one specific sock had a

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:22,340
million event today on the ids is 46
analysts clearly we were able to close

35
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:29,780
this tickets but not uncommon thing so
kind of call that flailing right if you

36
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,050
can't close most of your tickets

37
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,560
you're missing stuff and you don't know
what you're missing

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,290
it's kind of scary kind of the first
step in my mind

39
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,090
arguably wanted to can be interchanged I
want visibility in my network

40
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,860
what do I have whatwhat's there what
should be there and I'll seems kind of

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,020
obvious seems very similar to like sands
top 20 has things like an asset list

42
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:04,490
right along the same lines so visibility
and detection of known threats so what's

43
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,540
out there that everybody knows about
that there's solid rules for they've

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,340
been tested all over the place that we
know how to block we know how to prevent

45
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,910
we know how to deal with these things
when we get an alert for this it's not

46
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,560
going to be a false positive it's not
going to be some random thing it's going

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,120
to be an actual issue that we need to
deal with so those two things are kind

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,720
of the start

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,060
. when I end up walking the most stock
operations as the first two things we

50
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,820
discuss on this is where to go first

51
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,650
next is preventing the actual known
exploits right if you can block

52
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,250
ransomware neutrino and some other
exploit kits and really basic tax that

53
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,920
we know how to detect cleanly or not
seeing much only false positives clear

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,290
next step right seems reasonable

55
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,490
I've not found many organizations that
have gotten to this point where they're

56
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:05,360
effectively blocking all known exploits
that are clean that are you have alerts

57
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,370
for you know these are always going to
be true and then kind of the next phase

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,100
as much as the threat folks hate to hear
this to me once you have those known

59
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,930
threats dealt with then we can start to
really look at threats that we may not

60
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,950
have such a guarantee on things like
this bad IP address or this bad user

61
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:34,580
agent string that may or may not be an
actual issue might be just somebody with

62
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,990
love for internet explorer for dough for
example

63
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:47,780
Thank You HP I or it might know i would
rather deal with that after I've dealt

64
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,340
with known issues before I deal with the
supposed industrial control system

65
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,739
malware that was actually HP openview
thousands of times a day actually about

66
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:05,930
a hundred thousand so cumbersome story
time so there was a breach recently

67
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,780
getting well recently is arguable this
point but one of the most well-known

68
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,289
reaches as far as what they have
disclosed on how a breach actually

69
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,340
happened came through at least I got as
much as stories i have for any breach

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:31,460
have heard of so in this particular
retail example they had a lovely each

71
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,390
fact vendor up in Pennsylvania they got
phished

72
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,310
happens and most organizations at this
point if its large enough fishing is a

73
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,500
real problem and it's going to happen

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,020
our goal of security professionals is to
prevent it from going forward prevent

75
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,270
lateral movement and from them being
able to walk around the network for

76
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,640
months or years before we deal with it
seems like a reasonable possibility it's

77
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,010
good to try to prevent fishing but
trusting the user to do on a hundred

78
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,840
percent job of detecting good phishing
attempts probably not right

79
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,650
even IT security professionals get
fished it's hard sometimes

80
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:22,010
so kind of that . we're okay they got
fish fine they had saved the credentials

81
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:29,630
for our lovely retail target for remote
access again the ability one be able to

82
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,040
do remote access based on a single
credentials probably bad plan right

83
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,890
two-factor authentication is not that
expensive anymore we can reasonably do

84
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,640
that

85
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:49,190
not too hard take some work so they were
able to connect still the one the few

86
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,670
details that have been able to get was
what did they connect through today

87
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,260
pivot through or did they actually
connect from another site that would be

88
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:08,570
a fun question for anyone working at the
start at the target organization so if

89
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,940
they were hopefully they blocked it so
that only valid IP addresses when I

90
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,240
could have remote access that would be
another reasonable thing that they

91
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,050
probably didn't have set up so okay

92
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,960
each fact vendor now attacker gets into
the particular store and they're able to

93
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,549
get to the HVAC system makes sense then
they're able to move to the point of

94
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,950
sale network knots ago segmentation is
something we learned in the nineties in

95
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,920
theory but not yet today apparently we
still struggle with segmentation across

96
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,920
most IT networks to that

97
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:53,550
most almost all have segmentation issues
in different points so once they were in

98
00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:01,469
the point-of-sale network they uploaded
some stage 1 malware seems fine grab

99
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,860
take a look around see what they are
playing with so that they were able to

100
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,339
ok learn the label and upload stage to
start to collect credit cards

101
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:23,370
ok in-memory malware kind of tough but
in this case I their protection systems

102
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:32,309
ironically fire i ended up detecting the
stage to shower so from that point there

103
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,350
was about a three-day period between
initial detection and when credit cards

104
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:44,999
being started being exfilled so a
three-day period one detection and they

105
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:50,910
still hadn't remediated it who knows how
long later so all the credit cards were

106
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,860
able to be exfilled so kind of a bad
response to detection but beyond that

107
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:04,110
what is the easiest way to find a ton of
data leaving your network anybody no

108
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,059
surprise if you have just a massive
mounted yes sir

109
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:29,429
netflow that's right when you see each
practice are you guys going over channel

110
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:34,829
that you don't necessarily transmit a
gig of data or whatever that is in text

111
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,839
worth of credit-card data right
regardless of the factors credit card

112
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,699
data if you have a gig of ftp and you
don't normally use that ftp outbound

113
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:51,359
kind of weird so netflow would have been
a fun way to detect that beyond any dlp

114
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,709
solutions that

115
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,059
yeah not a big fan of those haven't seen
much success with it

116
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:03,329
but before we go damning our particular
retailer we really have to be careful

117
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,909
his know the old saying people in glass
houses shouldn't throw stones right

118
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:16,738
is your organization really that much
different I mean kinda bad but like do

119
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:21,689
you have a full asset list of every
device you know what mac addresses

120
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,309
should be there

121
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:30,059
do you have good segmentation in your
network everywhere from say separation

122
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:36,629
between different departments so no HR
and finance should be on wouldn't say

123
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:43,799
restricted networks but more protected
than say you know random receiving and

124
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,089
shipping or whatever depending on what
your company does your certain areas

125
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,649
that you want to protect a little more
segments all having very flat networks

126
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,209
with very little segmentation is too
common today having two factor

127
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:03,779
authentication on every single remote
connection from outside in to me this

128
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,059
seems like it weekly reasonable thing
and not she not expensive to do anymore

129
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:12,988
it really isn't there's more and more
vendors in the space it's not just RSA

130
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:18,059
anymore they always had some options but
now things like duo and other companies

131
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,879
have done a good job of making it very
easy

132
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,019
oooff is free if you really have the
time to implement all of it so the

133
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,839
there's reasonable solutions out there
to work on these problems response time

134
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,429
the hall tickets under three days
probably the most difficult one for most

135
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:42,509
socks out there are a lot fall behind
quickly and never really catch up part

136
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,049
of that goes back to security
engineering but we'll come back to that

137
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,459
in a minute

138
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:56,069
application whitelisting especially one
a high-value devices so point-of-sale

139
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:01,199
systems as well as industrial control
systems come with one major awesome .

140
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,579
for protection we know exactly what's
going to be on there and most of them

141
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,520
are very similar so creating an
application whitelist for

142
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,540
your point-of-sale is trivial and you
can test it

143
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,130
industrial control systems little harder
but most organizations today have

144
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,790
servers and other things that they can
build application weightless profiles

145
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,650
for additionally endpoints you can do
application whitelisting pretty well

146
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,590
plate and test mode and see what's
triggering stuff and then enforce mode

147
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:38,380
so these are features out there that a
lot of organizations could easily

148
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,810
implement but they take time

149
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,380
engineering resources these things are
hard sometimes

150
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,310
so if you are under the same situation
where you had someone coming after you

151
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,770
helped how much different with the
organization be again while target was

152
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,860
go a great example of a breach where
they released all the information almost

153
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,350
there's not many where we have these
lovely case studies with a release

154
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,490
almost every detail but we trust to
learn from so that's kind of a hard

155
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:20,230
problem but specifically ids is kinda my
bread buttered potatoes of the sock

156
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,050
operation so talking about Matt narrow
little bit more detail so kind of the

157
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:33,430
four most common IDS's that I find today
in organizations snortin sir kata the

158
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,250
two almost brothers bro IDs now it's
kind of a different type of tool and

159
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:46,840
then fire i obviously they're here today
and having fun arm so break it down a

160
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,640
little bit i snort from what I've seen
is the most popular again condoms jaded

161
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,670
view given most of the time when being
brought in

162
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:02,110
I it's for snort Sourcefire type here
being open source and then the Concordat

163
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,480
support through Sourcefire at kind of
nice if you want to do big deployments

164
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,050
signature-based started out in 1998 kind
of an interesting story with Alan

165
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:20,400
sniffer and more was how the name came
about took some research to find it

166
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,300
suricata I kind of the offshoot of snort
in 2010

167
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,640
they fought this North project to go a
slightly different direction for shikata

168
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,520
still signature-based but kind of a
slightly different goal for sericata

169
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,280
over snort and probably the most known
difference is its multi-threaded

170
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,770
although if you're doing a deployment
big enough where a single thread is not

171
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,870
sufficient with reasonable hardware you
probably should you know looking at an

172
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,110
enterprise to lat . instead of an open
source but I've myself done cat 10-gig

173
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,320
deployments of open-source snort it's
doable it's difficult but doable bro ids

174
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,470
is actually the oldest of the group
started out are one National Labs 20

175
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,420
years ago over 20 years ago and come up
some interesting automated details you

176
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,599
can actually hold netflow a pro as well
which i thought was kind of interesting

177
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:29,100
first playing with it a lot of power but
probably to me the biggest component of

178
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,520
it is it gives you a lot more visibility
into what's going on in your network

179
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,949
today where we have ever changing
networks that no one has documentation

180
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:44,040
for a set lists are hard being able to
have a dynamic tool to do visibility and

181
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,579
to see what's in my network what's there
and notice changes not just netflow but

182
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,710
in data types can be really really
helpful in about 10 years ago is

183
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,980
actually when bro really started to get
going ironically through funding from

184
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,130
what I've seen primarily for industrial
control systems department of energy

185
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,950
actually pushed for bro really hard and
kind of funded a lot of its ability to

186
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,120
move to a bunt from a bunch of guys
doing development when they had free

187
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:21,119
time in the National Lab to a whole
unfunded projects that could sustain and

188
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,379
really make a huge difference over the
last few years it's gotten way more

189
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,190
popular with the ever-expanding networks
just get that visibility

190
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:38,330
in fire I kind of a customized norton
Luke mind with some other they called

191
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,580
magic and hunting arm unfortunately this
is the only closed source product of the

192
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:50,810
group also started about 10 years ago
but my only concern is you can't really

193
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:57,409
get detail of why something was detected
and work on false positives kinda have

194
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,770
to rely on them to do that and I like
fine to sell to me I you kind of come to

195
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,820
a crossroad

196
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,560
what should I use this is a common
question that a lot of words end up

197
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,860
looking at and just picking one without
really looking at differences so to me

198
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,139
kind of the the bro is a little bit off
on its own gives you visibility but not

199
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,820
really detection of threats so it gives
you number one in that lovely face ikol

200
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,210
not necessarily 23 maybe three maybe
it'll block started it doesn't even have

201
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,960
the ability to do blocking his three
prevention of known threats again rose

202
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,780
not something you can really drop
traffic so you come down primarily in my

203
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:51,320
head to snort first shark otter and also
. wise emerging threats firstsource fire

204
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,429
and these to kind of go at UH the
problem in two different ways so

205
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:05,750
Sourcefire insist and snort are designed
to look for specific threats they're

206
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:13,190
engineered to be better at looking for
explicit threats not necessarily IP

207
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,500
addresses or threat indicators whereas
suricata and emerging threats are

208
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,870
designed more around i hear this IP is
bad maybe we should look at it it's

209
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:30,199
actually engineered to be more efficient
on ip-based rules and other nom

210
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,540
guaranteed indicators so that's kind of
an interesting detail from literally

211
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,889
talking with developers last year at
security onion contrite after security

212
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,260
onion con based on the emerging threats
guy is finally getting that one

213
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,060
in the room and having the conversation
of why do you do IP baseball's force nor

214
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,730
their awful indesign they don't work
very well and I were primarily cercado

215
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,280
circuit design for that I don't know the
sales guy kind of cell ended up

216
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,139
contacting some of the developers for
psychotic turns out they do prioritize

217
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:11,950
ip-based rules way more than say I'll
others so one of the first things in the

218
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,180
analysis stack was ip-based Bulls seems
reasonable

219
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,070
it's a different methodology arm
Sourcefire and cisco well Sourcefire

220
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,750
says if you have an ip-based rule and
you think it's bad

221
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:33,220
that's called a firewall rule you block
it but and I don't know to me once

222
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,990
you've gotten your known threats that's
when you can start to take care of

223
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,460
maybe this is bad so there's place for
both but one is better one component one

224
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,560
of better another so security
engineering is kind of hard it's a

225
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,850
little complex like this so which logs
are helpful comment easy question once

226
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,550
you've been in a sock all the while but
when you start looking at how to

227
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:06,280
configure snort can be pretty daunting
there's roughly two thousand lines of

228
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,820
configuration for snort in addition to
the 30,000 ourselves a labels so it's a

229
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,370
lot of information a lot of choices and
the documentation once you know all

230
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,590
about it can be a decent enough reminder
but it doesn't really teach you how to

231
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,639
use the product how to configure it in
either snorter shark caught up both

232
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,260
running this problem

233
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,620
matter fact even while working at
Sourcefire after the best documentation

234
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,979
I've seen your house nor is designed
comes off the personal blog of somebody

235
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,560
who never worked in engineering

236
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,440
he worked in product support here and i
know this is unreadable at this distance

237
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,530
blind secret calm / wiki

238
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,870
as this lovely chart it literally goes
through the components of house nor

239
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,780
processes traffic piece by piece

240
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,990
this is the only document i have seen
that goes anywhere near this much detail

241
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,970
on how detection works at what stage of
certain things get thrown out when

242
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:24,160
certain components are analyzed traffic
in depending on how r what component has

243
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,820
an issue with traffic where text where
it drops where it falls over and then

244
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,830
again this is off a personal blog there
was no document remotely close to this

245
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,050
while I worked at Sourcefire and my
friends who are still there tell me they

246
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,820
still haven't seen anything like it

247
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,409
so kind of a hard problem when you
really don't have documentation for

248
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:59,680
design one how things work so deployment
kind of a mother fun detail obviously

249
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:06,820
security onion fan favorite here is one
of the deployment options out there

250
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,590
comes as nice oh really if you're going
for production

251
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,940
the ice is not so great you have six
different gooeys you really want a vm

252
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,310
with six cookies with all your company's
protected data and security are you

253
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,429
really gonna go through changing all the
passwords for all the gooey zall the

254
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:34,360
databases everything the Pat there is a
way to destroy deploy security onion via

255
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,679
package you choose the packages you want
please love God do not deploy the iso in

256
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,510
production for protection of your
organization i know there's guides

257
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:52,840
online of how to do with the package
system its way better rock and sm is

258
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,110
another tool similar to security onion a
couple of differences in that they chose

259
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:06,459
one buoy one database are one database
tool they have all the things together

260
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,370
and they added google stenographer which
is

261
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,379
kind of a cool open source free pack
full pack capture tool and then

262
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:21,490
autoStore same guy who did the design i
made a tool where you set up your system

263
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:26,530
and then you run his script and it will
download install the tools snore you

264
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,770
choose ago you choose things so much
easier

265
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,020
I'm different deployment options so
steps forward when you go back to your

266
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,440
organization get them get the sock to
start to really look at what's in their

267
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,740
network and start to look at what are
the things that are causing us the most

268
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,530
tickets if you have more tickets you can
manage like most everybody solving that

269
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:59,170
problem of okay ten percent of our
tickets are this particular rule good

270
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,309
place to start

271
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:25,960
does anyone have any question yes sir i
would probably never deploy all the

272
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,550
rules at once there's too many that are
applicable the environment arm pulled

273
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,350
pork is a lovely script that allows you
to categorically decide what roles to

274
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,120
use what was not to use i normally would
start with one of the predefined

275
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,428
policies so there's three available
security / connectivity connectivity

276
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:49,990
over security and balance and then turn
on and off categories and we'll types

277
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:55,780
based on that and turn off there's a
bunch of really annoying ones things

278
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,840
like echo request and echo reply

279
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,080
these aren't useful rules arm unless
you're just trying to drive yourself

280
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,100
insane

281
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,949
so there's a lot of those rules and so
turning on get starting with what you

282
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,300
think is about right and going adjusting
from there turning on specific threats

283
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,460
you are concerned about in certain ones
you aren't by OS x application

284
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,039
it's a good place to start it is a
living process it is something that

285
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,329
takes a significant amount of time to
work on other questions yes ma'am

286
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:47,769
so that's not necessarily is particular
to an IDs but more basic network

287
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:53,409
analysis that's something that's learned
there's not really a great mechanism to

288
00:26:53,409 --> 00:27:00,549
learn how to identify good versus bad
yet it's kind of one of the heart

289
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,859
problems of the sock world and finding
an answer is kind of like how do you

290
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:13,749
learn decision-making right that's not a
question that i can answer in a minute

291
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:19,479
i'm still working on how to figure out
what the best way to teach basic network

292
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:30,039
analysis as far as is this bad or not
it's not an easy problem so that's a

293
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,109
different problem that's not a stage of
how far in and out in ability to see

294
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:42,249
your sock is that's more around your
people specifically do they have the

295
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:47,259
skills right this is more maturity of an
overall sock rather than maturity of

296
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:52,719
individuals if someone in the sock can't
figure out how detective traffic is bad

297
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:58,569
that's more of a fundamental people
problem arm and I know a lot of the way

298
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:04,329
that people start is literally jump in
and hope you don't drown again that's a

299
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:08,678
large problem for the sock community
that we haven't had answered a lot of it

300
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,599
is keep going

301
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:13,989
analyzing that particular traffic until
you know what it is if you don't know

302
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:14,979
what it is

303
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:18,279
figured out first the tenacity to do
that is hard

304
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,989
I'm out of time here i think i will be
around after

305
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:34,620
thing was know that that's really yes we
could give this
