[Music]

4
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:58,649
today focus of today's spa all right so

5
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,679
[Music]

6
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:10,679
just

[Music]

13
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:58,600
but to also up the best

14
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:29,089
[Music]

15
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,290
[Music]

16
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,029
[Music]

17
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:44,580
whereas our our sea breeze you know

18
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,969
[Music]

19
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,310
[Music]

20
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,639
all right

21
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,730
[Music]

22
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,170
[Music]

23
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,130
[Music]

24
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,889
[Music]

25
00:07:43,039 --> 00:09:09,170
so all of a sudden the suit becomes

26
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,890
hey decide approach we want to use

27
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,930
surprise run surprise I'll talk about

28
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,750
that second we've got any be permitted

29
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,680
this is where Wilson works the hardest

30
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,030
bit with morning is not balloon tool and

31
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:40,720
using the tools then we've got the

32
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:49,060
proper features are straightforward

33
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:56,170
right so those are the key steps all

34
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:26,710
right so let's talk we have a signature

35
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,830
or something we could detect it but the

36
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,010
back

37
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,309
[Music]

38
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,269
[Music]

39
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,740
[Music]

40
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,029
[Music]

41
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:29,819
my versus my red team features right

42
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:33,410
versus the bad guys

43
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,830
[Music]

44
00:12:50,840 --> 00:13:07,870
[Music]

45
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,799
[Music]

46
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,470
that's where I would positive leaves

47
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,000
encourage state machine learning and

48
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,860
where we do the powerful works

49
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:39,029
hey normal activity so there's basis

50
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,579
supervised which basically just means

51
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,529
that the we direct the learning of the

52
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,410
machine this is generally best for

53
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,050
solving very specific problems right

54
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,089
some very discreet but he leave native

55
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,149
swag my little we need samples

56
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:07,140
bad it's a good okay but it's harder to

57
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,350
get good to drink that is big bad things

58
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,430
get back come on right there's not more

59
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,320
analysis not manage all of these free

60
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,079
resources out there that got tons of the

61
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,959
present rate samples of bad that we use

62
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,980
the game

63
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,070
[Music]

64
00:14:50,350 --> 00:15:23,180
this is detection this is security for

65
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,100
general security you're gonna run into

66
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:52,130
problems this dream the problem so to be

67
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:04,430
clear about we need and there's all

68
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,360
these famous with word of that that

69
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,589
spreading out the smaller piles of

70
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,110
native is perfectly fun what you just

71
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,870
find use an advocate better other sizes

72
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,980
data then

73
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,600
[Music]

74
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,010
so

75
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:08,760
[Music]

76
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:35,770
[Music]

77
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,210
[Music]

78
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,609
[Music]

79
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:49,860
whereas not just me

80
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,330
we can't tell something too bad

81
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,519
[Music]

82
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,329
[Music]

83
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,779
[Music]

84
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:59,830
okay so we're parse it all of the data

85
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,860
and we'll compute the variance on all

86
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,310
the different hats anything with target

87
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:21,700
to use as a feature so that is like to

88
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,580
start figuring out which which happened

89
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,050
which things that reduces features all

90
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,310
right so as I said Python it's a great

91
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,130
option that's what I prefer but there's

92
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,140
lots of other things that could be used

93
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,810
the reason Python is such a great option

94
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,500
is because there's a lot of people

95
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,289
[Music]

96
00:21:47,289 --> 00:22:00,489
that are huge Frank Bannister

97
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:09,229
and so they've already have rhythms

98
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:13,729
guarding them all that stop and you see

99
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,639
this has been by one two three two

100
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,999
pieces of over here right we're going to

101
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:24,589
need weight sparsity obviously I use

102
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:26,929
whatever parses we put it into our

103
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,139
datastore we're back algorithm the

104
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,899
algorithm don't know what happened to go

105
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,899
with certain this rainforest rainbow

106
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,709
forces of

107
00:22:44,169 --> 00:23:07,820
so you know it's and then in the Trinity

108
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,889
mode and an analysis of them so what I

109
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,839
mean by this is you practice in one pool

110
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:18,320
just for simplification pieces go free

111
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,639
Frank's what I've got

112
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,849
assuming that's free and suddenly

113
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:25,759
national right it's just too different

114
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,140
from soccer just understand

115
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,309
[Music]

116
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,309
[Music]

117
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,309
[Music]

118
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,760
okay and then the animalizer model

119
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:33,510
parses today and calls out so let's look

120
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,860
at some of this rather than me just

121
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,630
talking about it alright so I'm going to

122
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,789
get this kicked off so I've got a

123
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:47,700
trained model here so this is isolated

124
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,309
fasts so I'm gonna run this against you

125
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,399
can see a directory there well first off

126
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,590
I'm loading my two mono files back to

127
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,909
risers and enemy then I'm running it

128
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,010
against a directory called a simply test

129
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,899
small and then I'm going to put any

130
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,440
output into a file called findings text

131
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,140
and the - B of course is just for boast

132
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,480
so it tells what it's doing so I'm gonna

133
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,610
start that now because it takes us a

134
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,140
minute to load the models because the

135
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,880
models are are pretty big

136
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,559
well let's doing that I'm gonna pop over

137
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,080
here to show you the code so here's the

138
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,840
trainer code notice I'm bringing in the

139
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,600
modules I need and then there's my

140
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,649
option set up right and then here's

141
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:34,710
where the real work goes on so we've got

142
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,799
here on line 45 right

143
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,330
[Music]

144
00:25:42,330 --> 00:26:58,360
all right bro - art for the win right

145
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,630
it's your peek-a-boo process against

146
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,610
that and so that's what's in those five

147
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,530
in those directories then I'm

148
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,700
classifying it right uh which is lying

149
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,640
to 51 through 53 and then 56

150
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:20,059
literally right this entire program is

151
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,279
59 lines level sorry I said 53 earlier I

152
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,590
did put blank lines in between please be

153
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,929
clear and then the assess program on the

154
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,809
other side just does the opposite right

155
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,080
so it starts out here by loading the

156
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,450
models right you can see up there at

157
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,320
line let's see that's 47 so it light

158
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,230
loads my my vector file on my mono file

159
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,200
and then it just iterates through all of

160
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,710
the all of the files and the notice is

161
00:27:49,710 --> 00:28:02,879
right out okay so then let's make it

162
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:06,570
sense so far oh and we're done over here

163
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,460
then we scroll back up so you can see

164
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:17,519
what it did but as you can see it

165
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,470
punched through a little bit of files

166
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,070
here alright there we go get it back to

167
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,320
the alright so it loaded it then it

168
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,750
started on the directory right so here's

169
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,379
the assimilate test small let me open

170
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:34,049
that open that up for you just to show

171
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,230
you what that looks like

172
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,210
so these files so these are just log

173
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:47,720
files output from bro let me turn off

174
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,460
line wrap and make this a little bigger

175
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,580
so you can see it so these are just the

176
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,889
bro HTTP header up okay so that's the

177
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:01,019
files that I've both trained off of and

178
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:03,690
and I'm working off of so it parsed

179
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,870
through all of those and then it rode

180
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:14,669
out to a file called scroll down to here

181
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,740
somewhere there we go sure that was done

182
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,139
and so we should have a results dot txt

183
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:24,500
here

184
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,180
my name's not that I'm sorry don't

185
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,650
remember my name the Midlands

186
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,490
oh and now I'm going to turn them back

187
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:43,290
on so the line it called out is this

188
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:49,199
yeah that looks a little I certainly

189
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,930
somebody is you know doing a request

190
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:15,250
against that with a really big that's

191
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,670
the power of machine work took a whole

192
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,580
bunch of files like I say your biggest

193
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,610
work is in the south the the biggest

194
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,670
work is in the getting those clean data

195
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,650
and an unclean data

196
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:35,250
let me show those directories here okay

197
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:45,130
so for the mouths on this doesn't want

198
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,320
to make it you get the idea here I think

199
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,080
those are eligible right so each one of

200
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,240
those is the distinct and literally what

201
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,210
I did was I took a packet capture of the

202
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,480
comms from the malware and then I ran it

203
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,570
through bro - R then I edited so one of

204
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,940
the key things here that you want to be

205
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,230
aware of so again if I

206
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,380
one of these bad files times so if I

207
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,780
open up one of these bad files I

208
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,630
actually went through every single one

209
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,950
of these bad files because there's a

210
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,210
whole bunch of noise right so when the

211
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:48,710
malware is going on but the harder part

212
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,160
is the normal traffic here and I want

213
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,410
you so take a note of the sizes of these

214
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:08,750
log files so these were about oh I think

215
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,210
it was about an hour of pcap capture

216
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,170
from some of our pro sensors that work

217
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,590
few terabytes

218
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:30,279

generation with a very very powerful

222
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,799
capability one of the and and there's a

223
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,539
bunch of tools out there at this point

224
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:35,919
already so and there's a light on each

225
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:46,960
one strikes to be misses and ultimately

226
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,929
do that and you're still problems you

227
00:33:49,929 --> 00:34:13,149
probably have unclean you probably this

228
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:18,599
is also it actually has two will do

229
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,239
surprise surprise

230
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,030
so that's kind of fun simulator smiling

231
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,720
some way

232
00:34:32,109 --> 00:35:20,980

251
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,050
but I

252
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:57,740
really solid oh yeah that's exactly

253
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,420
right that's where that really becomes

254
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,420
important is to we'll get back kinda

255
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,880
fade over time right so now that I knew

256
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,490
this is bad or this is one minute flight

257
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,740
is potentially bad is not actually bad

258
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,079
I'm going to run that back through and

259
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,160
keep back

260
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:39,160
so mine right now in my experience is so

261
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:29,900
right so right but mostly I'm using so

262
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,750
like that probably

263
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:47,559
