[Music]

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,168
[Music]

11
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,520
[Music]

12
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,600
parts right

13
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,090
all right

14
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,320
[Music]

15
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,060
right this is me at 4:00 p.m. when I get

16
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,540
a hundred feet

17
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,250
[Music]

18
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,339
[Music]

19
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,049
[Music]

20
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,530
first of all

21
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,110
[Music]

22
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,370
[Music]

23
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:39,329
this is of course to be able to kind of

24
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:42,600
maintain level three friends and I have

25
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,930
them all the time

26
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:53,459
so we're not one of these

27
00:11:53,459 --> 00:12:05,040
that between this right you see

28
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,529
something is like a normal business this

29
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,250
is a loser

30
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,879
[Music]

31
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,920
[Music]

32
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
that change the whole game right but you

33
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,290
need context and you need to have some

34
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,810
way of trying to take that bias away

35
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,070
from you so we're going to do a little

36
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,060
experiment here really quickly we're

37
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,040
going to watch video you may have

38
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,200
watched this video before right

39
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,890
I don't know may we'll see and your goal

40
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,900
watching this video it's to count the

41
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,460
number of passes from the white shirts

42
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,880
all right

43
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,329
so pay attention

44
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,660
all right so how many how many passes

45
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,480
from the players in the white shirt

46
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,860
anyone knows let's say anyone counted

47
00:13:36,860 --> 00:14:04,070
less than actually the correct number of

48
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:54,890
passes it's 16 right so this is how well

49
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,780
let's watch it again right and now

50
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,310
you're going to see the gorilla and now

51
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,320
you're going to see the curtains change

52
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,330
in color and you're going to see the

53
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,190
black player leaving leave in the room

54
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,610
right

55
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,480
so notice that starts with the curtains

56
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,320
in in red

57
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,640
the other senator gordly Carson's right

58
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,050
and that was only two players on the

59
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,080
black shirt so that happens when you're

60
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,230
in

61
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,239

70
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
this

71
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,930

Brenda confirm peonies

75
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:26,629
he's changed that's possession most

76
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:30,029
useful news NSA this question is

77
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,779
answered by this

78
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,399
[Music]

79
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:02,549
and it's giving soon our developer right

80
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,159
so you goal so this ends here you can

81
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:11,070
now program used to check the quality of

82
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,019
your code so essentially to say we have

83
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,750
made repeated questions across my my

84
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,629
investigation police you can use these

85
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:30,870
so this is a manager support so you may

86
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,809
be saying in a question Chinese season

87
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,139
you know of course we would say host

88
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:39,090
so you want to be consistent across the

89
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,070
board you can define the state's useful

90
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,279
names

91
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,660

[Music]

98
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:44,390
questions right - we have duties yeah

99
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,890
practice but practical time analysis
