1
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,490
so

2
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,190
back said so if you missed part one are

3
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,870
you going to be lost and so my response

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,810
to him was that is my get out of jail

5
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,900
free card for everybody I have a couple

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,340
things up here but I pass these around

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,960
to kind of do a little bit of admin

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,560
stuff you just take something a couple

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,330
of nice gifts that we can give out so

10
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,320
there'll be some questions that we're

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,630
gonna ask and we'll see where we got

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,900
this year we got a batch Bunny

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,180
practical packet analysis right because

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,410
it's Saturday and what else would you do

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,940
on Saturday besides study packet

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,970
analysis and the blue team handbook so

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,650
we'll be passing some of those things

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,010
out so by way of introduction for those

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,260
that don't know me who here was and by

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,910
the way notice what I just did what did

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:34,920
I just do I'm getting ready to do this

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,410
I'm leading off with a question right so

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,780
I'm going to talk about

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,190
so Jason Blanchard gave an excellent

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,380
brief in fact if you miss it catch it on

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,550
the video because what he did was he

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,800
really talked about the storytelling

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,440
process how they make movies literally

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,509
how they parse the time out in the movie

30
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,280
you keep your attention you keep it keep

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,000
the story going

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,770
and there's joseph campbell would say

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,390
take you on that hero's journey from

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,450
beginning to end right with the book i'm

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,860
in the back of the room listening to

36
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,569
this brief at 11 o'clock i spend a lot

37
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,610
of time with my flight back together and

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,440
then also you said now that's how they

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,330
make movies this is how you're supposed

40
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,790
to do a presentation at which point

41
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,260
while he's talking I'm back there

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,440
writing notes down and then I ran like

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,360
weasel for about an hour and read it on

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,950
my slide so I tried to mirror what Jason

45
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,380
did so but his takeaway was beginning

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,870
with the question and then end with any

47
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,390
conclusion so if I don't say in

48
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:40,430
conclusion you're probably gonna win so

49
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,040
this is why you're here like I said if

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,690
you weren't here for part one I gave a

51
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,750
speech similar in this theme last year

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,720
by way of introduction I'm a retired

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,730
military guy spent 25 years in the Army

54
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,170
I'm what they used to call an X we're

55
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,730
trying to figure out like Bobby is this

56
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,590
old cyber house how to bring the bunch

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,780
of plumbers electricians and folks

58
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,910
together to kind of gain access into

59
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,070
something whether or both or close

60
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,800
access so if the world if you can

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
imagine for me to be on the outside now

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,490
talking about cybersecurity is very

63
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,960
thing that I was trying to pop on the

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,090
inside I am now trying to prevent on the

65
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,880
outside right so I became very decent in

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,800
a concept and here comes the question

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,500
the concept of micro segmentation so by

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,330
show of hands here and notice Jason

69
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,010
check the block I'm asking the question

70
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,500
who here is familiar with micro

71
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,440
segmentation okay now I'm going to parse

72
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,390
it out a little bit let's park there for

73
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,440
a minute when I'm talking about my

74
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
precipitation I'm talking about

75
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,739
collision domains I'm not talking about

76
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,290
trying to get data packets and smashing

77
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,080
into each other on you know on the wire

78
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,970
that's not the micro segmentation I'm

79
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,320
talking about I'm literally talking

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,810
about micro segmentation where I am here

81
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,280
you were there and we start creating

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,950
some space between us so that I can do

83
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,870
things here or things can happen to be

84
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,000
here without impacting you there so is

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,410
everybody kind of tracking with what I'm

86
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,450
talking about from the target like

87
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,620
reciprocation good

88
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,660
you now have Park line so check the

89
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,120
block everyone now is certified

90
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,670
I'm truly a sans force on you Sam

91
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,089
spreads on this part one in a nutshell

92
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,048
what we're going to tell you though is

93
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,410
we're going to tie that in again about a

94
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,940
year ago when I gave this speech in this

95
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,500
very room with some of the very same

96
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,600
people in this room microsegmentation

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,660
was a relatively new concept to me and

98
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,470
industry-wide it's a relatively new

99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,169
concept to industry right for various

100
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,060
reasons which we'll get into here but

101
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,979
the takeaways of this presentation is

102
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,169
we're going to tie my reciprocation into

103
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,820
the theme of this conference which is

104
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,220
you know critical infrastructure

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,290
protection which if you haven't seen the

106
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,460
movie sneakers that's why the movie

107
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,830
sneakers is kind of the patron saint of

108
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,650
this conference okay and we're going to

109
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,270
talk about the threat landscape we're

110
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,430
going to talk about some tools

111
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,470
techniques procedures what my reputation

112
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,510
is and how you can then implement it and

113
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,940
then as a shout out to Jason Lantern I'm

114
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,139
going to show you how you can apply that

115
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,060
practical knowledge to a real-world

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,580
example okay any questions before we

117
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,889
move on now why are these sighs who

118
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,479
hears familiar concept between the

119
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
trifecta a holy trifecta of our

120
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,200
community well I saw it quick

121
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,019
[Music]

122
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,569
[Applause]

123
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,600
so the way nice way to think about this

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,280
is this imagine a swimming pool

125
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,530
DEFCON ain't nobody even pool people are

126
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,000
throwing things at each other people are

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,229
shooting water guns at each other

128
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,819
they're probably having blast beverage

129
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,389
containers all over the pool you know no

130
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:11,110
holds barred

131
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,120
you know the granddaddy you know the

132
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
patient the index zero if you will and

133
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,139
then we transition into black hat black

134
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,789
pack you trying to formalize a lot of

135
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,039
that and now a lot of the wildness goes

136
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,870
away but it's really more formalizes

137
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,030
here's some techniques or some texture

138
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,889
some procedures or some way to break me

139
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,419
the things that are currently out there

140
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,590
today yeah there's a little bit of

141
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,460
cutting edge stuff however be sighs does

142
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,630
anyone of these cited references right

143
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,250
so back in the day with black members

144
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,990
here people let me people like you would

145
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,880
say I want to talk at blackhat they

146
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,380
don't have switch room and all those

147
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,759
things that they couldn't have time for

148
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,970
a black app use the B side all right and

149
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,470
so there's some folks out there you can

150
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,789
follow them on Twitter but they came up

151
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,229
with this concept called b-sides and

152
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,789
b-sides it's really what you get a

153
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,110
chance to talk about those things that

154
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,060
may not be applicable right now in this

155
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,669
very moment like for example you get to

156
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,139
talk about some things that may be a

157
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,070
little bit further down the pipe that's

158
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,120
really what we're gonna do here today

159
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,009
we're gonna explore this notion of micro

160
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,570
segmentation although I will tell you

161
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,240
it's already being implemented today but

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,740
anyway so that's why we're there back up

163
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:31,810
for a second there's two things on there

164
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,190
that you need to take away from this

165
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,599
from that slide right there and where

166
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,310
they tie in each other there's something

167
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,900
on the left hand that ties in something

168
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,729
on the right can anybody do that we're

169
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,580
getting close it's getting warm boom

170
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,859
boom all right Corey you get it

171
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,899
all right so Lord of the Rings Jared

172
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,309
toki comes up the concept called the

173
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,919
palin tears the obscene high is the orb

174
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,229
right if I flip into my volunteer and

175
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,819
you open L interior your region

176
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,080
I hate to see what's going on in your

177
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,989
region that's hard to see you have some

178
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,669
eye announcer to have omniscient

179
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,830
presence on my network but in a nutshell

180
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,419
what does it mean it ties into the

181
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,669
left-hand side here everything is under

182
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,349
security from my perspective it begins

183
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,479
with the word see I need to be able to

184
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,979
see everything on my network

185
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,990
if I can see it I can control it if I

186
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,429
can control it that means I can touch it

187
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:27,269
if I can touch it

188
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,039
that means nothing protecting that's

189
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,990
what we've always tried to do is nothing

190
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,089
new in sexy devil what is different goes

191
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,188
the notions of Mike reciprocation

192
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,828
once I see it touch it and control it I

193
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,139
didn't want to start separating now in

194
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,339
the world of Mike reciprocation we're

195
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,990
going to get into a minute it becomes a

196
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,219
little bit squirrely because up until

197
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,079
this point we didn't have things readily

198
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,399
available to do that like

199
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,620
software-defined networks we didn't have

200
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,500
things like you know the ability to have

201
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,120
an enterprise scale near real-time near

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,880
machine speed like an ability to control

203
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,160
that Network right but that exchange we

204
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,889
have that capability now right so that's

205
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,329
what we're gonna kind of talk about but

206
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,040
again nothing new here let's kind of

207
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,139
move on and again what's old is new

208
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,060
what's new is old everybody else me that

209
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,670
is so simple right what does he say if

210
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,990
you know yourself you wouldn't have to

211
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,540
back if you know your enemy you know you

212
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,189
win the bet with the true jeez that's

213
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,990
the problem we have today everybody

214
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,579
spends a lot of time reading all the

215
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,829
rent laws there but they they have a

216
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,040
hard time

217
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,170
with their own we're gonna talk about

218
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,180
why that's a problem here by the way I'm

219
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,920
talking very fast this Jason told me at

220
00:09:35,920 --> 00:10:05,950
11:30 during sleep my friend so this is

221
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,320
the movie sneakers this is Bishop he's

222
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,180
blind and he's able to pick up some of

223
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,190
my technique runs right he's listening

224
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,810
on the water and in certain cones on the

225
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,180
telephone system DX is picking up he's

226
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,220
hearing it he can tell mother we're

227
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,720
together right so that's why that's

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,880
important this ties it to hearing where

229
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,350
I'm walking you now on the hero's

230
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,820
journey like we're setting the friending

231
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,160
the problem this is the movie and there

232
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,900
he is what's significant about that

233
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,100
venture he slide so if you haven't seen

234
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,050
the movie that is a blade the blind man

235
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,940
driving the truck that has all their

236
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,800
infrastructure popping equipment in

237
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,750
right and you don't see some of the

238
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,680
other stuff but if you haven't seen the

239
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,300
movie I suggest you watch it right so

240
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,860
we're just warming you up this is what

241
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,630
they were doing this is why you guys are

242
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,100
in here it's all about critical

243
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,320
infrastructure profession this end of

244
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
today's what they were trying to do so

245
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,139
really when I said

246
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,600
when a patient perspective trying to get

247
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,429
into a network a lot of times when it is

248
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,559
remotely from sanctuary I'm doing you

249
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,850
hear where I'm safe and secure i

250
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,889
remotely going to your network sometimes

251
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:04,959
you just have to send the Verizon cable

252
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,309
guide to your house and they have to go

253
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,499
in physically do something right so

254
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:09,879
that's why this becomes important and

255
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,869
that's why critical infrastructure

256
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,529
becomes a very interesting topic to me

257
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,239
now gonna throw you a hardball I heard

258
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,709
if you love anybody tell me with that

259
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,829
screenshots wrong oh that hand went away

260
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,839
too fast that means you know the answer

261
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,949
right anybody anybody besides one good

262
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,189
perfect

263
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,319
I knew you knew it too you tell me the

264
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:34,209
guy who owns that a keyboard or that's

265
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,540
trimmer

266
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,869
that's more like by Kevin Smith yep

267
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,699
that's one but what distresses me is

268
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,339
when you look on this you see some ICS

269
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,410
exploitation things on there now good

270
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,759
take your time I'm not gonna dive into

271
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,009
it but go watch the movie because a lot

272
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,839
of what my heart lived for your die hard

273
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,999
the movie dealt with well as critical

274
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,619
infrastructure protection right which

275
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:58,149
leads us into here let's start with

276
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,489
other firms we got to use some of these

277
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:02,199
things fast and loose micro segmentation

278
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,850
you've already talked about what it is

279
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,049
in my view in my lens the way I use my

280
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,759
segmentation in my community it complies

281
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,199
the Software Defined Networking the

282
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,529
encryption buying brain you know policy

283
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,689
controls push down to the workload level

284
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,999
I'm literally talking about security

285
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:23,860
pushed down to the IP packet right and

286
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,939
then critical infrastructure if you

287
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:25,989
don't know what those things are you can

288
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:29,049
look above later 63 and superseded by

289
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,720
homeland security policy seven basically

290
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,069
it just spells out what is

291
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,670
give me some of this my VHS community

292
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,860
made Sunbrella there's a veritable

293
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,699
ecosphere looks like what's significant

294
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,910
about that

295
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,870
no we did not boy I got you know what

296
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,269
you are lucky you are getting you are

297
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:17,490
getting the answer they're all connected

298
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,660
right so when you protection a lot of

299
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,639
people because human nature want to sit

300
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,589
there and bend things because it's easy

301
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,389
for humans to get around they've been in

302
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,220
it's a my controller this is my rice

303
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,230
ball this is my thing is all the fossil

304
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,180
for that is the absolute worst way to

305
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,889
look at infrastructure things everything

306
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,829
is connected like transportation relies

307
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:39,509
on pretty much all of those things in

308
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,339
order for us to operate right for guys

309
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,189
like me those are our pathways to defeat

310
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,920
if I can figure out a way a loose string

311
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,910
maybe there any way that I can build so

312
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,139
what we want to do is we want to bust

313
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,939
rate then by the way that's Rob choice

314
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,860
over there there's more than later but

315
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,120
if you don't know about your guard

316
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,839
InfraGard

317
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,490
local we have chapters here now standing

318
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,709
up in Augusta Georgia but these are the

319
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,420
InfraGard chapter members and where they

320
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,499
comprise it is a community owned once

321
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,300
you're involved in this community you

322
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,519
are part of this conversation SMEs and

323
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,019
folks that just want to help protect the

324
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,730
critical infrastructure this is how it

325
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,410
breaks out right but this is a nice

326
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,050
snapshot it gives you an overall view of

327
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,459
what the critical infrastructure

328
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,839
portfolio looks like and by the way

329
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,670
these slides I will share with you after

330
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,839
this just get with me and I'll give you

331
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,050
power on the slides a covers so here we

332
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,139
are this is it three ways to do this I

333
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,010
see $99 with

334
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,900
there's no one in this right if if I

335
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,760
talked about ICS if I talk about state

336
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,410
if I talk about booty operational

337
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,190
technology control system supervisory

338
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,320
control and data acquisition all of that

339
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,600
stuff that makes things like factories

340
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
refineries pipelines all that stuff to

341
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,120
make it work it's all covered by group

342
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,620
of folks a consortium if you will nice

343
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,300
and 99 is there every policy they tell

344
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,010
you there's three ways to protect that

345
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,890
stuff right and by ICS and critical

346
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,240
infrastructure where you ways to do it

347
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,200
the traditional way

348
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,190
ergo I'm telling you is not I will tell

349
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,279
you that through spectrum I can get and

350
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,560
touch to you in your network it's just a

351
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,480
matter of time right because part of

352
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,890
spectrum whatever you want to call it

353
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,720
there are different ways to get on to

354
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,730
the actual keyboard for keyboard attack

355
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,790
through different stuff you guys know it

356
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,920
don't know it google the word on the

357
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:35,390
Washington Post or State for waves VLANs

358
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,010
so we got a little bit sexier we decided

359
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,480
to go with demons right so let's go

360
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,250
ahead and throw hardware and software

361
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,890
cloud whether logically and isn't least

362
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,110
separate things like we're gonna do that

363
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,450
with feelings virtual networks right the

364
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,670
problem with that is a lot of the VLANs

365
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,610
tend to be specific to the platform with

366
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,320
the OS right and so if you could imagine

367
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,820
if you started stealing out of global

368
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,350
need enterprise-wide it becomes

369
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,110
physically hard to do you just don't

370
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,029
know and let us think away one thing

371
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,640
from this life we do not exist in

372
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,860
themself just to do security we do it to

373
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,080
support something most cases that

374
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,520
something is either the Department of

375
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,680
Defense or a business model right

376
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,720
without the business model or the

377
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,459
department offense the point is we would

378
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,800
not be doing security so it has to be

379
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,360
something that we can actually apply the

380
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,890
resources that we have and they are

381
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,890
limited and they are finite to fromsett

382
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,720
I would like to talk about micro

383
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,190
segmentation because it's a new approach

384
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,020
and it's something that I've been anyone

385
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,720
is saying

386
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,900
so here's your problem how you deal with

387
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,290
that is a problem that is nothing new

388
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,600
you guys the problem it's always on so

389
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,500
when I talk about critical

390
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,210
infrastructure I'm talking about systems

391
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,840
that are always on they never fail right

392
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,670
you have an OPS versus security tension

393
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:59,870
right it is well to our pushes to this

394
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,700
mistake of time let's talk about this

395
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,080
can anybody tell me what the

396
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,730
significance of the council is look at

397
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,260
that memo what was the point of the

398
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,180
Mogul in the council everybody used to

399
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,800
pick everybody's experience or knows

400
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,359
that there's a castle here the guys have

401
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,680
heard me talking about this last year no

402
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,690
they saw me this is one of my favorite

403
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:21,500
topics what's the point but what is it

404
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:39,500
over here to the left-hand side a little

405
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,050
bit of a joke there but think about

406
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,050
those on the left with that boat right

407
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:56,570
there but you know what I don't have

408
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,410
anything more to give you

409
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,810
so the original intent of the most is if

410
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,760
I came at you and I couldn't get into

411
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,860
your perimeter reflectances what that is

412
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,600
it's why we use it for cybersecurity i

413
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,680
couldnt get it from

414
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,140
what I do I'm late CG back the old days

415
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,750
we called it lay siege anyway we have a

416
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,370
short stack right I just keep throwing

417
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,600
things at you and prevent you from

418
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,520
talking outside your network therefore

419
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,810
your business model will fail because

420
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,550
I'm shutting you down from isolating you

421
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,770
like you'll hear everything I talk about

422
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,900
the military flavor because 25 years

423
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,630
it's hard to get out of my system but so

424
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,160
they came up the concept of the moat the

425
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,900
moat was designed because when I was

426
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,030
leading siege to you for 30 days

427
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,150
what were my engineers do they were

428
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,250
digging a hole in the ground and coming

429
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,350
up underneath that mode and coming up

430
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,160
into the castle the water in the moat

431
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,290
was designed to flood the tunnels to

432
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,570
prevent engineers or to the thing right

433
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,580
so think about that if you look over

434
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,410
here on the left hand side if I'm going

435
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,730
to come out your attack I'm gonna come

436
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,170
at you the least the most the most

437
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,520
recent resistive path way to defeat how

438
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,020
I'm gonna do it so I'm gonna start at

439
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,640
the top I'm gonna look at you logically

440
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,200
and I'm gonna go I'm gonna make sure I

441
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,790
meet your people I'm gonna spear fish

442
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,140
you know I'm gonna vomit officiating

443
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,700
spearfishing I'm gonna go on social

444
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,440
engineering if that fails I'm gonna keep

445
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,360
dropping down until I get to a point in

446
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,980
fact if I'm really cool it if you

447
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,140
believe movies that we watch today what

448
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,610
will happen you'll find I'll have that

449
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,890
one pool champion that speaks a weird

450
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,990
language it sounds like dolphin but he

451
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,050
codes in C++ in his sleep everything in

452
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,320
fact ecosoc solution match he does he

453
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,870
just went there to complain right the

454
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,480
point is I will drill down farther and

455
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,620
farther till I get support where I'm

456
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,270
literally tunneling underneath your

457
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,610
defenses come up into us so what we want

458
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,960
to do is we want to prevent it because

459
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,580
what happens once you're inside the

460
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,710
castle that's the key once you're inside

461
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,230
the castle we analyze typically each

462
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,390
Swiss traffic it's trusted and now

463
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,650
that's where we have the

464
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,180
the point is starting to happen right

465
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,310
lateral movement so everything on the

466
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,140
right hand side there's nothing new

467
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,440
there can anybody tell them anything and

468
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,490
why is that important

469
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,910
Wow from out of nowhere a hand shoved up

470
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,460
on the right hand side give in to music

471
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:36,830
yes positions if I can teach you groan

472
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,420
if I can't smack you in the face what

473
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,470
I'm going to do is I'm going to figure

474
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,970
out of the way you come in from somebody

475
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,530
to talk to and typically in the business

476
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,030
world you see it that's why I have it up

477
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,440
there in the first because they're not

478
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,750
sexy right all this other stuff is sexy

479
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,820
stuff it is in the taper but this is the

480
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,620
Borg stuff unpatch systems right mergers

481
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,150
and acquisitions what does that

482
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,070
represent that means I name a company

483
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,160
like four examples work and I hire a

484
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,290
company to be my friend well guess what

485
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,330
I'm integrating them with my network but

486
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,040
guess what a lot of times we don't make

487
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,750
the seamless transition for the security

488
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,940
policy so it's holistic and so now I

489
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,700
have a pathway for Fiji right so what

490
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,070
are we

491
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,310
this line in the civil unions we are

492
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,470
trying to not prevent the intrusion at

493
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,090
the end of the day you are not gonna

494
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,530
prevent a tradition that we're trying to

495
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,600
do this mitigate and reduce the threat

496
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,570
so that catastrophic failure or loss

497
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,210
ie it gives the business model owner

498
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,790
time to respond and if you can couple

499
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,560
that with something really cool which is

500
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,110
reducing and automating the flash debate

501
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,720
in terms of detection into response now

502
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,610
we really have something powerful and

503
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,300
that's what we're gonna talk about

504
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,340
nothing new here in the sake of time

505
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,770
we're going to keep going this is what

506
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,500
we're going to change right this

507
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:07,290
understanding so it becomes very

508
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,330
challenging right so when a world of

509
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,370
many recent Tatian

510
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,770
in a world of many how do you reduce the

511
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,200
scope of both your service as well as

512
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,140
your compliance that's what we're trying

513
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
to do now this is not Jack talking this

514
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,670
is from that guy over there on the left

515
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,480
hand side used to be running DHS who

516
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,010
owns all the cybersecurity for this

517
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,240
critical infrastructure stuff and of

518
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,220
course now mr. chief staffer he's moved

519
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,340
but he said that and that's nothing new

520
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,880
to you guys right what is interesting to

521
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,030
me is the following slide that's good

522
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,620
he's talking about the same things that

523
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm already talking about and this is a

524
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,060
this is horse or marine infantry officer

525
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,100
saying this brings me probably wrote it

526
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,960
for him but he's still saying the same

527
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,210
thing this is what is interesting this

528
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,980
is the takeaway so during that time you

529
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,960
get away with this or not I put the link

530
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,550
up there for you they put some

531
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,370
controllers out controllers on because

532
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,130
we want to see what our networks and you

533
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,510
know that we're probably not going to be

534
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,130
cognizant

535
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,740
so let's turn around see us out there so

536
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,880
they knew they they were probably to

537
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,500
come back with a number maybe 10 to 20

538
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,060
percent over what they thought they had

539
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,860
that's the number that they came back

540
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,960
with so think about that attack surface

541
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,740
area so the early patch is a 70%

542
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,060
successfully of all systems if you think

543
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,190
you matter but the systems that are the

544
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,140
devices you think you have actually you

545
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,630
have 24% war start doing that math you

546
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,520
see how your attack surface is now not

547
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,190
only unbelief but unknown to you right

548
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,570
which guys like me useful up right we

549
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,250
would call that pivot once in lateral

550
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,020
move but that's that's a thing and then

551
00:23:52,610 --> 00:24:04,830
slowly work there and that was 44 nights

552
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,680
it's kind of interesting anyway there's

553
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,620
probably no correlation so world as the

554
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,810
world is evolving so again we're talking

555
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,490
about some things in the military they

556
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,420
used to have a term called dynamic

557
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,860
network defense they were trying to get

558
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,840
to this notion where we could not only

559
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,520
see the entire network but they

560
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,290
controlled the entire network and then

561
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,000
the graduate level calculus is when we

562
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,010
send control the network we wanted to be

563
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,720
able to manipulate for the network in

564
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,540
real time based on the the existential

565
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,160
threat at the time in the operational

566
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,790
environment

567
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,040
what does happen and then a jump means I

568
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,770
don't not website because it's cold out

569
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,110
or because you know the weather's that

570
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,380
you know my body is designed environment

571
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,799
and yes I'll get cold but my body go

572
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,139
I'm cold it will send my foots up

573
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:50,840
isolate the cold and all the other vital

574
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,179
functions will continue to move on what

575
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:56,090
my body goes to this hole now it's why

576
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:04,909
this is B sense our conversation right

577
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:07,610
so why did I put full freedom up there

578
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,960
where my feet set

579
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,879
why is this like Wolverine we talked

580
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,679
about like reciprocation Wolverine and

581
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,869
Weapon X what made them different almost

582
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:20,239
dead on right so high man Tony Stark

583
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:22,669
what did he do what Tony Stark dick he

584
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:24,769
built a perimeter but what you get

585
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,359
inside the perimeter Tony Stark is just

586
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,960
a rich dude with an attitude right where

587
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,929
we're being penetrated orange everywhere

588
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:39,649
you penetrate we'll read Adam who he is

589
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:41,629
and so no matter who you world the body

590
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:43,669
adapted to it I mean that's why he's in

591
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,909
perfect right so that's kind of the the

592
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:48,919
analogy that we want to have here and in

593
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,269
a day we want to do this oh by the way

594
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,489
listen let's not forget why do we do

595
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:54,470
security what do you think weighs in his

596
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,970
normal visit do you think it's security

597
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,559
or do you think it's some Alliance which

598
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,330
one is the weight when they know their

599
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,330
infrastructure are they doing it because

600
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,119
they want to know the best policy best

601
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,980
security posture than that or do you

602
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,389
think that they're looking at a list and

603
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:11,299
make sure that their regulatory or they

604
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,009
can pass on it they pass the regulatory

605
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,600
and their compliance and their oversight

606
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,279
and all the legal issues and that no

607
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,419
one's going to go to jail you know by

608
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,029
the way you're DPR

609
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,970
not the company you will is your rock

610
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,110
supported right

611
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,730
hasn't happened in mistakes but that's

612
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,399
the harbinger of things to come

613
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,950
right most companies will look at the

614
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,929
compliance and way compliance versus

615
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,549
security to promote compliance what do

616
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:38,110
think about it even if I'm the vinner

617
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,640
Network what am I going to do I'm gonna

618
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,380
go with your bank financial institution

619
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,490
I'm going to download all the open

620
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,500
source regulatory compliances you have

621
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,440
to go by I'll help you deal with build

622
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,299
about 70% what your infrastructure looks

623
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:51,760
like because I know what dates and what

624
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,159
tests and what you know things you have

625
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,960
to pass now I've got a 70 percent

626
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,850
solution of what your infrastructure the

627
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,740
security posture looks like based on

628
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,179
open source knowledge just simply

629
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:02,710
because you're trying to pass the plank

630
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:12,250
and stay alive so how do we do this how

631
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,929
do we prevent you from doing that for

632
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,039
those that don't remember last year

633
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,110
that's Rob Joyce old boss of mine he is

634
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,179
now Cyprus are for the United States you

635
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,649
can watch this unusually cuz this is

636
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:22,480
fascinating we actually have a closet

637
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:35,140
and what do you think he said first

638
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,820
thing you want to do understand you

639
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,870
network better than anybody else

640
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,730
recently defeat shoes because we

641
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,830
understand your network with you number

642
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,740
two segments and by sending the crap by

643
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,470
that every baby mama right make it so

644
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,270
bad basically every time you do

645
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,159
something members are security you have

646
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,380
a crunchy outside and soft inside make

647
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,210
it so that every time you take a bite is

648
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,669
crunch crunch nice crunch because what

649
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:59,710
is the crunchy do every time I'm working

650
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,570
harder to gain access to getting deeper

651
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,580
access and escalate privileges I am

652
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,200
working harder to become reason my

653
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,370
second trip since 6:00 p.m.

654
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,659
things like that that's what we want to

655
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,450
do right stop kill chain it's not

656
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,789
perfect it's just a nice way to explain

657
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,440
something it's a 20 more so that you can

658
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,779
have a discussion about penetration to

659
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,880
people and help them understand them now

660
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,679
answer this question if you were to stop

661
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,090
an attack where you want to stop that

662
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:32,370
attack like so actually where would you

663
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,720
stop that attack where's the best place

664
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,360
to stop the attack anyone there you go

665
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,130
right now think about what he just said

666
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:54,090
how do you see if I'm inside your

667
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,760
network right I think you can cite your

668
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,500
network inside on the dungeon it's all

669
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,110
black spaces I have a new word from the

670
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,880
inside I'm not raising an alarm inside

671
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,659
the network right understand but if I

672
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,519
can break you out here like you said

673
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,830
that's where I want to do it right but

674
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,210
in order to do that I have to understand

675
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,500
what the devil looks like right so again

676
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,630
going back to what rod toys said this is

677
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,850
not jack talking right this is industry

678
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,919
best practice this is nation-state best

679
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,559
Parris hydronium points from scans how

680
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,330
do you do that enable strong

681
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,830
authentication and encryption enabled

682
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,240
whitelisting that was the third thing

683
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,649
that Rob Joyce mentioned white goes

684
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:34,139
right and then with your communication

685
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,019
to varying the unencrypted

686
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:37,980
microsegmentation

687
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,919
right so that's how we do that so don't

688
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,659
be hearing about this

689
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:43,979
show you how we're gonna do this right

690
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,599
in a real-world example of what would

691
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,429
that look like how would we do that

692
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:58,739
okay what is that what is that I love

693
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:01,169
the picture represents to me that's

694
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:02,759
software to find out right it's hope

695
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,619
permission but it's what Starling state

696
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,479
right information it's the birds

697
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:08,009
communicating with each other and

698
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,690
they're able to fly in those patterns

699
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,639
whether it's in response to a threat or

700
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:12,989
it's a response to the operational

701
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:15,599
environment I just made nature sound

702
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,889
very technical so the bottom line is

703
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,710
think about your ability as a network

704
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,029
administrator to be able to a lot of a

705
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,590
to do that with your network response or

706
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,330
threat right so that if I'm getting a

707
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,460
pop to your plan a fire threat issues

708
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,389
going on over here

709
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:32,639
I can have my system automatically

710
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,429
respond covered by networking to adapt

711
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:37,379
that and more importantly in some cases

712
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:41,090
isolate I see some of the CTD folks

713
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,129
right why would I want to turn the

714
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:44,999
system off

715
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:46,950
I want nice a way to keep it alive so

716
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,629
that whatever now where everything is

717
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:50,220
sitting in their living in my system I

718
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,049
wanted to stay alive in the system but

719
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,239
what the agency would do if you read the

720
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:55,679
Washington Post and believe with the

721
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,720
Washington Post says they will take an

722
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,999
attack pull it out take it over to the

723
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:02,309
safe zone turn it back on see what

724
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,109
destiny and understanding but what about

725
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:06,239
the time losses did what if it actually

726
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,889
did it inside your network while was

727
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,840
going on that's a human burglars we

728
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,450
don't take something that we get cold

729
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,729
nobody takes it isolates it prevents it

730
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:15,450
from doing

731
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,909
from an inoculation Wester this is the

732
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:24,539
automatic solution right so but how do

733
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:25,559
you do that right that was in the

734
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,769
details so here we go this is not jack

735
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,320
I have first this is recorded I have

736
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,899
blatantly taken this from the Gartner

737
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,289
report in 2017 there it is

738
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,730
sources have been cited and I have about

739
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,049
there but they do a very nice job

740
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:44,010
simplifying a very complex there's four

741
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,590
ways that car again and she recognized

742
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,450
leader in terms of what the best

743
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,639
practices out there are four ways to do

744
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:53,130
these native plant controls third-party

745
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,519
firewalls hybrid and thought I'd like to

746
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,230
take overlays for $600 please okay so

747
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,399
quick overview of each one for the

748
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,750
safety times only leave some time for

749
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:14,220
questions microcircuit XD that's all

750
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,750
this right they are building an

751
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,419
ecosystem they're baking insecurity into

752
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,769
the ecosystem so that for example fires

753
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:26,090
I don't want anything thrown in

754
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,860
dispersity nice well played well played

755
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:35,760
we're not talking so with my billion

756
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,529
dollars on their infrastructure for the

757
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:47,750
clap for a part of that conversation

758
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,480
this hand right now let's say I'm the

759
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,040
federal government table thank you let's

760
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,570
see how that ATMs out there they're all

761
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,640
running clips better yet let's say

762
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,140
they're critical infrastructure

763
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,780
protection it's always on right it'll be

764
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,030
turned off if it's up and running I'm

765
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,490
not touching typically that means

766
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,990
probably not past right because

767
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,880
sometimes it's not just a matter of

768
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,950
patching things why the company's not

769
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,050
patch next one thing is they don't see

770
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,790
the equipment so they don't look magic

771
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,850
to they just may not have their security

772
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,670
posture tied in with oversight controls

773
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,800
checks and balances right the other

774
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,330
reasons that people don't talk about is

775
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,700
companies don't pack infrastructure

776
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,200
especially large scale infrastructure

777
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
like that because they're afraid they

778
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,500
won't be able to handle the patch the

779
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,150
upgrade will actually break the system

780
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,150
is designed to patch right and so you

781
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,800
made 12 passes something and all of a

782
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,250
sudden this is just children right it

783
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,390
happens at home with people with their

784
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,730
laptops sometimes you try to upgrade and

785
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,520
you know I got a laptop for a long time

786
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,260
and at some point it just all of a

787
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,300
sudden a that message your system can no

788
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,740
longer update to the new operating

789
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,090
system because it's old and busted

790
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,700
everybody no matter that is easy when

791
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,020
it's one laptop now when you've got

792
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,710
thousands of any notice of an employee

793
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,060
there you go hi you want a state when I

794
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,190
say good body language ones like your

795
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:35,100
age the gray line he's willing to be

796
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,918
ready so that's the point that's why

797
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,090
companies don't patch but myself

798
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,550
myself I'm a business model remember

799
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,320
security is not secure secure safe

800
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,360
security support business from a

801
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,650
business perspective it makes sense to

802
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,090
me now I'm forcing you to have to buy

803
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,719
yourself I am NOT controlling you versus

804
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,159
the other way around so when people say

805
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,750
how many weapons to probably they'd be

806
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,090
better really think about that you're

807
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,770
leveraging the cloud but really is the

808
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,660
crowd leveraging you were you leveraging

809
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,470
box

810
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,450
don't even answer think about but anyway

811
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,640
so that's a native cloud solutions micro

812
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,930
segmentation that's not what I'm talking

813
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,440
about

814
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,800
third-party firewalls to be an example

815
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,550
of that

816
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,150
juniper Networks these are companies

817
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,400
that make a firewall whether it's harbor

818
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,610
or software basis but they throw it and

819
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,920
they ask you to basically put it inside

820
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,010
your research make sense

821
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,930
how many end nodes yeah or how many

822
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,250
applications you're under how many

823
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,530
servers the attack rate the more you

824
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,300
have the bigger client there's more

825
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,130
licenses all that sucks goodness this

826
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,600
model right that's not what I'm talking

827
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,720
about this you always have a high

828
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,640
profile like this - - when people don't

829
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,370
know what they want so firewalls that

830
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,230
gives you my bottom again I'm trying

831
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,760
trying to gain efficiencies from some of

832
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
the software-defined stuff so I'm going

833
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,270
to do that right so you always have the

834
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,190
micro segmentation hybrid model right

835
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,360
doesn't matter what you do you can have

836
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,100
a little bit that that's not what we're

837
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,260
talking about folks this is what we're

838
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,880
talking about the overlay model why is

839
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,200
the overlay my heart interesting because

840
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:19,280
everything I just talked to you want to

841
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,280
use this type of equipment what type of

842
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,150
operation what type of infrastructure

843
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:31,160
you have so what are you using so hard

844
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,930
walls well then that kind of pointy

845
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,810
I want something that says I'm not sick

846
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:48,510
to be lesson to the knees I laid on top

847
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,730
of it and what it will do is sit down

848
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,740
with a very bones of that infrastructure

849
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,650
without disrupting the current operating

850
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,360
system infrastructure applications all

851
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,380
the stuff that you're currently an

852
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,030
invincible right leg you can say

853
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,130
volunteer business guy what have you

854
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,580
done

855
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,310
your ass is OCIO it doesn't matter as

856
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:12,780
long as you're not you typically need to

857
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,440
ask for money

858
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,090
because you have a five-year plan or

859
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,500
three-year plan the point is you have

860
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,630
been in state you can hire them they say

861
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,070
when you have no money that work cuts

862
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,260
money loose you implement that the last

863
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,610
thing you want to do is then go back in

864
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,440
and say I made a mistake I've screwed up

865
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,750
I need another ten dollars because this

866
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,040
is not the best thing to do right

867
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:39,690
so what that's the challenge that's the

868
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,520
overlay model and that's what we're

869
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,200
getting ready to talk about so in the

870
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,859
time I have and we got how much time 10

871
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:53,460
minutes 20 minutes I'm like I got two

872
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,600
slides left baby see this this is why

873
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,760
I'm not filming

874
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,880
you know this is the good side right

875
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,470
because the part of the part of my hair

876
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:18,390
is on so here we go overlay

877
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,790
microsegmentation model that's agonistic

878
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,580
to the infrastructure right what if I

879
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,530
could automatically virtualize any IP

880
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,590
number right now think about that if

881
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,390
you're talking and you're using tcp/ip

882
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,000
you're talking right that's what I want

883
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,630
to I want to virtualize okay captain

884
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,150
fancies there okay cool but what is it

885
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,560
retreat committee is I want to do that

886
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,990
from an identity based workload

887
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,700
perspective it doesn't matter where you

888
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,980
are it's not tight this is where the

889
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,790
water right University issues whenever

890
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,010
my credentials and by the way I freely

891
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,570
admit the reason I just sick credentials

892
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,800
and I know there's probably some pen

893
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,390
testers out there that went what if I

894
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,280
popular credentials yeah

895
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
you're for conversation that's not this

896
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,940
that that'll be number three so I'll be

897
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,000
next year song but I have an answer for

898
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,820
that if I have authorized potentials and

899
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,290
I get on to the demo it doesn't matter

900
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,300
where I am I want to be able to have my

901
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,130
security policies follow me anywhere in

902
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,750
the world song like a mic as long as I

903
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,930
recognize that microphone right now my

904
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,970
credentials you probably compromise me

905
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,740
but I got an answer to that right that's

906
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,780
why my presentation is powerful because

907
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,340
remember I'm not preventing the

908
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,200
exploitation I'm preventing the spread

909
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,390
if I call the tyranny of the Apes right

910
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,790
the cross-pollination cross propagation

911
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,040
the escalation right the tyranny of the

912
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,110
Apes all the things that mr. exactly

913
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,520
would want to do one since I can either

914
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,490
fight and I was only making work harder

915
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,840
so I'm think it'd work harder than their

916
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,850
signature a whole nother conversation

917
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,430
which is good for me so next thing I

918
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,710
want to do there we are now this doesn't

919
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,440
matter if it's servers over on the right

920
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,090
hand side or to the crown jewels or

921
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,190
these are end-users if it does it

922
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,260
doesn't really matter the point is this

923
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,570
is TCP I traffic right and the old days

924
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,520
this is the all trusted stuff right here

925
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,160
right the point is I want to be able to

926
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,570
segment it down to the individual

927
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,130
windows now I'm going to is there

928
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,500
anybody in here that works selling

929
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,580
firewalls for a living because this is

930
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,900
the point this is why I like talking to

931
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,700
be silence versus my day job because the

932
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,560
b-sides that can be out here and I can

933
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,450
talk about the stuff in my day job quite

934
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,950
do this I usually get thrown out of the

935
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,230
door like what I'm getting ready to talk

936
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,170
about literally if done correctly

937
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,910
negates the need for a final think about

938
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,300
them

939
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,100
week why are the firewalls designed in

940
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,990
the first the control traffic this is

941
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,100
nothing sexy about Aparo

942
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,720
they recently designed because there was

943
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,070
a lot of loosey-goosey traffic going

944
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,740
back and forth

945
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,869
one of the ways if these kind of scaled

946
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:45,460
out it got thicker and bigger we wanted

947
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,320
the way to logically control the flow of

948
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,910
traffic back and forth to make sure

949
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,619
things got to where it got to go and

950
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,150
then all of a sudden sort of get it

951
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,560
nasty so we want to be able to way to

952
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,630
keep bad guys out and keep good people

953
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,609
that and then it became an issue where

954
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:59,080
if you're like a company that got really

955
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
cool that you would certainly have

956
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,660
conversations like stateful and

957
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,550
stateless traffic inspection all right

958
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,450
the point is we started adding more and

959
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,810
more things as opposed to just fixing

960
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,720
the problem right next a lot of what we

961
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,550
do right now in cybersecurity you have

962
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,560
an infrastructure I have a problem I buy

963
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,440
solution because I bought a new

964
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,030
equipment and then I have another

965
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,690
problem

966
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,060
I read something happen over here dark

967
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,460
reading says this or darkness is over so

968
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm gonna find more quickly bring next

969
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,910
up in I'm not agency stuff off I got

970
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,170
your cell phone so I'm constantly

971
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,820
modifying my act as it gets to the point

972
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,230
where an apple could be hundreds of

973
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,810
thousands of lines in an apple right now

974
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,190
think about the vulnerabilities in

975
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,170
something like that who manages that and

976
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,180
that's the vulnerability so remember you

977
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,200
guys are not doing security for

978
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,089
Security's sake you're doing security to

979
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,320
support a business model which means

980
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,780
what you've got to pay people to come in

981
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,430
there and go through nothing more than

982
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,740
hundreds of thousands of lines of actors

983
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,720
oh what's that

984
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,700
right why would you wanna do that and by

985
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,530
the way by the time you're going through

986
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,849
all that stuff people are moving around

987
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:02,500
second network doing stuff so anyway

988
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,250
next thing what I'm gonna do here is I'm

989
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,589
gonna see my hair I'm going to use agent

990
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:11,820
based stuff software-defined stuff

991
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,440
basically say what is talking to what

992
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,490
find out everything that's

993
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,109
everything one time none of those things

994
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:19,390
are I am then going to lock down every

995
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,250
one of those things now theoretically

996
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,839
think about those at a high level of

997
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,700
extrapolation you take an organization

998
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,680
and you wrap it in something like this

999
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,599
and then as you start to understand your

1000
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,880
network you start parsing this name down

1001
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,400
until you have higher secured Carlos

1002
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,900
literally

1003
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,430
packet level between individual

1004
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,440
workloads and then it's automated from

1005
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,270
Software Defined Networking so that your

1006
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,220
review me as much as the human out of it

1007
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,140
as possible that you're gaining time

1008
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,730
you're getting speed the day

1009
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,349
efficiencies in terms of costs and

1010
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,210
overhead response all that good stuff

1011
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,809
right next in here it's got to be that

1012
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:54,309
special requirement it's got to be any

1013
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:56,470
ipm right so if it's talking it can be

1014
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,450
enabled right and then of course that's

1015
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,180
a cloud inside there now

1016
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,980
here's what really cool what if I could

1017
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,240
throw some of that stuff on there too

1018
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,460
now this is a conversation that I would

1019
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,049
love to have with you it's a positive

1020
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:10,450
conversation apples right now what are

1021
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,740
some things that I would want to have in

1022
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,799
my I want to have things like right make

1023
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:20,319
sure it's a guest on GP is that deep

1024
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,119
packet inspection right if you guys

1025
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:28,869
familial DNA how is that a contractor

1026
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,549
happened to look at encrypted traffic

1027
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:34,720
going out of the network and when and so

1028
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,210
when he went into the traffic was in

1029
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,799
there he went oh

1030
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:41,140
that's Jack's fingerprints and all of

1031
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,980
his history for his clearances right so

1032
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,299
now everyone's like you know what I want

1033
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:47,770
to have more of that I want to have to

1034
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,869
tag instructions but but think about

1035
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,359
this what if I can put a layer of

1036
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,190
security in here with that level of

1037
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,990
certification do you know what that

1038
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,839
means now he is a crypto bag job right

1039
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,279
which means with quantity

1040
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,440
each part of a job right but it also

1041
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,869
means that if into the bin again is

1042
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:06,849
changes but in today's technology or

1043
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,920
understand the quantum technologies with

1044
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,569
the stuff that's coming down the pike

1045
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:13,359
even if you through that at that type of

1046
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,990
encryption at 256 it's still resolved as

1047
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,730
a strong password which means even if

1048
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,289
you've got a hold of the data it would

1049
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:23,230
take you on quite a long time to decrypt

1050
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,150
it to figure out what was inside here

1051
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,740
which by the way here's the business

1052
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,770
owner who just lost Excel

1053
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,500
to reactor right again each time right

1054
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,660
now this is the thing that's really

1055
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,560
interesting to me

1056
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,600
the policies are applied based on the

1057
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,640
user's or server's role in an

1058
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,920
organization not by the quest here's why

1059
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,830
in a large organization when I joined

1060
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,010
the organization somebody has different

1061
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,900
community mentor sorry Jax benefits on

1062
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,460
the connection so this isn't an exorcist

1063
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,260
but what happens when I leave the

1064
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,970
organization sometimes too many people

1065
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,380
want to make sure that I am now taking

1066
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,090
off on all of those same things right

1067
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,130
that's another step that has to happen

1068
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,450
sometimes you forget about real

1069
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,190
questions with that that artifact is

1070
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,170
still inside the network right and if

1071
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,790
they say is that stuff that induces

1072
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,790
turbulence in the necklace right or you

1073
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,460
know you're losing control of the

1074
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,440
network right what I wanted is the

1075
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,300
ability to sign into an organization

1076
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,920
have everything given to me so no matter

1077
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,270
what I'm at an organization I can sign

1078
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,890
that I've accessed entropy and then by

1079
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,650
the organization once my role is gone

1080
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,290
I'm gone that's it the network basically

1081
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,720
self knows it's closed and there's no

1082
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,680
way back in that's interesting and

1083
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,110
here's the thing we can talk about this

1084
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,470
after this presentation I love those

1085
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,670
back to his point

1086
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:48,180
I want those endpoints dark stop it at

1087
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,190
the reconnaissance face tie this all in

1088
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,170
the timing everything I want those

1089
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,120
things dark because what I'm going to do

1090
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,100
is nothing sensitive is seeing them but

1091
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,050
if I seen your network and instead of my

1092
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,940
PCP Packer come up to me and they'll be

1093
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,860
responding saying I can't hear you or I

1094
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,450
don't know who you are send again right

1095
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,580
now a conversation that may take what if

1096
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,170
when you send your mate I want to serve

1097
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,650
in shape

1098
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,070
and let that pack of the drunk right now

1099
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,260
it sound like a black hole you may know

1100
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,290
I'm out there right but you can't do

1101
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,000
anything everybody knows the time times

1102
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,080
like already we've never really seen

1103
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,000
lacquer it's just we've noticed the

1104
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,590
weird stuff happening around like all

1105
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,630
the gravitational stuff so that point of

1106
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,160
this is if there's something there black

1107
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,350
hole right kind of like in a network you

1108
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,030
may see bandwidth coming in there you

1109
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,760
may see spam you may see stuff but

1110
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,760
you're not able to log in right that's a

1111
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,350
powerful conversation that's what we

1112
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,300
want to do even today it comes down to

1113
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:41,890
this

1114
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,360
reducing nothing sexier than reducing an

1115
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,970
attack surface and reducing the audit

1116
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,470
service if I could do both of those two

1117
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,260
things at the same time Wow I increasing

1118
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,100
the flexibility resiliency and then I've

1119
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,780
got something so what does that look

1120
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,300
like in real life most of my time what's

1121
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,740
my time ten that's good perfect time for

1122
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,890
questions

1123
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,930
oh by the way that engineering piece let

1124
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,430
me explain what that looks like

1125
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,430
that's there let's say for example I got

1126
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,050
customer supports going back and forth

1127
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,610
and I got legal going here they've got

1128
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,080
communities of interest they're talking

1129
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,360
and they are aware of each other but

1130
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,160
they can't they can't kind of cross

1131
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,740
pollinate each other they are not even

1132
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,050
aware of engineering so we roll it that

1133
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,650
would be like PII separate so the things

1134
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,420
that make your network work you don't

1135
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,850
want your PIV on the same network and if

1136
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,440
it is you want to protect it right so

1137
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,270
it's those kind of conversations but in

1138
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,980
the real world this is what it looks

1139
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,070
like

1140
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,530
[Music]

1141
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,289
[Music]

1142
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:08,900
it's a right it's all had their cloaking

1143
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,089
device it would basically show up what

1144
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,349
if one of you show up enough you knowing

1145
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:13,970
about it and it just magically appear

1146
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,470
that's kind of like what we're talking

1147
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:27,319
about with micro segmentation so you

1148
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:28,819
guys haven't seen this but I got it

1149
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:41,200
I got to give this so in conclusion

1150
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,470
does this thing exist in 2025

1151
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,970
you know 400 years in the future of no

1152
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:49,039
it exists today are the organizations

1153
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:49,999
that have heard of using micro

1154
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:52,609
segmentation yes all four flavors I've

1155
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:54,769
showed you there in terms of the models

1156
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,809
to include the overlay are being used

1157
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,210
today does the technology exist yes it

1158
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:13,819
does exist is it being probably about

1159
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:17,390
five ten minutes seven minutes so we got

1160
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,739
to see that so seven minutes remaining

1161
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,660
for questions before we all stretch and

1162
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,549
get ready for Jake to do it Jake does

1163
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:26,960
that by the way if you don't follow Jake

1164
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,299
Williams on Twitter so questions so

1165
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:40,590
could be the same thing right yeah could

1166
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:41,760
be the same thing yeah

1167
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,440
and so the challenge deserver instantly

1168
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,180
said how do you define how do you define

1169
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:52,650
or bound if you will separate my

1170
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,630
favorite term in this world it depends

1171
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,690
right like when people say you know you

1172
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,910
know what if you were to so somebody

1173
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,530
never passes question but it comes up

1174
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,060
right if you were to employ my

1175
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,470
precipitation on an existing

1176
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,420
infrastructure what would be the load on

1177
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,310
the infrastructures right couldn't

1178
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,660
handle the load of microsegmentation

1179
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,360
right so the internet would be do you

1180
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,280
use my pset probably do it if your

1181
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,650
employee might be said to sing now right

1182
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:22,050
so it's not gonna do its effects right

1183
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,910
it depends and what type of trap yeah oh

1184
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,510
yeah

1185
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,040
how many endnotes do we have are we

1186
00:50:26,040 --> 00:51:05,430
having when you build the tunnels so

1187
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,530
what we're trying to do is understand

1188
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,280
the people are the worst right you know

1189
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,190
the most vulnerable population right and

1190
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:15,480
what I want to do is I want to prevent

1191
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,030
them from doing so as much as I can

1192
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,980
isolate them inside that network in

1193
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,870
their own community of interest so that

1194
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,700
way they can't help themselves it does

1195
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:31,320
the question so remember I told you to

1196
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,940
see questions this is the one guy I'm

1197
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,980
worried about is this I have a question

1198
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,290
that comprises seven parts broken into

1199
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:55,530
six subparagraphs yeah so that's a great

1200
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,250
mystery conversation right so if I was

1201
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,720
building the network right

1202
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,390
I would put a gateway out put a gateway

1203
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:07,260
right so inside here I lock this down in

1204
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,370
my micro segmentation

1205
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,870
right this is my IP actually that's the

1206
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,520
desert I'm talking to you I have a hyper

1207
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,890
secure tunnel think of IPSec on steroids

1208
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,780
you and I are going right but yet you

1209
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,450
still have a legitimate to go or not you

1210
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,100
but let's say somebody on the outside in

1211
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,920
the Internet has to talk to you later

1212
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,200
I would simply build a gateway but the

1213
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,690
point is that gateway they will be

1214
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,120
financially number I will understand

1215
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,350
where they are right and I can align my

1216
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:41,070
sensors my IDs my PS along so the keys

1217
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,530
the trip is right now when I deploy

1218
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,960
infrastructure to protect a perimeter

1219
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,060
the problem is I don't understand what

1220
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,010
the perimeter is so I don't have enough

1221
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,090
to go around

1222
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,200
so I have to figure out where the

1223
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,690
highest risk is and then put most of my

1224
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,250
good stuff against the highest risk area

1225
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,170
right well if I don't know what

1226
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,790
everything is how do you determine with

1227
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,800
the highest risk areas right so now by

1228
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,620
doing this I can selectively choose

1229
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,180
where those gateways on and guess what

1230
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,220
we're already doing nothing now

1231
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,840
returnable the government is already

1232
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,760
doing them now because when they went to

1233
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,370
me and said you will collapse the number

1234
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:17,190
of entry waves up to the Internet by an

1235
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,410
order of magnitude that was an attempt

1236
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,450
to begin the segmentation process where

1237
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,160
they could control and put those things

1238
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,760
so by the way so what about just

1239
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,100
described to you think about this is the

1240
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,040
matrix right this is this is Kevin and I

1241
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,900
have sitting there in that exoskeleton

1242
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,340
right there and when they open up the

1243
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,750
door to the outside to let more

1244
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:43,720
and once they set down at the gateway

1245
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,060
right they have people sitting there

1246
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,560
watching it and when the door was closed

1247
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,060
then they walked away that's what we're

1248
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,320
talking about so I build a gateway you

1249
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,830
like them

1250
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,150
and I would control those gateways and

1251
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,890
then those gateways would be what they

1252
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,080
would be my high-risk areas which means

1253
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,580
I probably plus up my sensors right

1254
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,740
there or I would probably make sure that

1255
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,840
the socks in all that cells tight ends

1256
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,940
with in any event going on and probably

1257
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,190
didn't get resources better there did

1258
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,220
you say someplace else right so that's

1259
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,630
one way that's one way off the top of my

1260
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:22,930
head anybody else I was getting ready to

1261
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,520
walk out and smile and the hand goes up

1262
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:41,859
in the back I would push back to you and

1263
00:54:41,859 --> 00:54:49,570
ask you define yeah right so it's not

1264
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,339
that the perimeter of itself is dead

1265
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:52,990
what I'm talking about here is making

1266
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,960
everything right I think when most

1267
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,280
people think of a primitive they're

1268
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,680
trying to physically wrap their head

1269
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,210
around something you draw a circle and

1270
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,070
say this is the perimeter I'm actually

1271
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,869
talking about micro segmentation which

1272
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:07,869
makes everything the actual IP the

1273
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,180
surface area becomes the actual IP

1274
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,900
packet itself

1275
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,070
doing this the way some companies are

1276
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,480
starting to do right now and they can

1277
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,339
only do it because of modern technology

1278
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:19,599
software to find that we're taking some

1279
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,820
of the advances are we that you're able

1280
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,380
to push the security faster so now we're

1281
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,670
talking already right

1282
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,410
the actual model can the IP packet

1283
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,420
itself the fact the data itself becomes

1284
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,940
the perimeter which means if I want to

1285
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,160
traverse and do a heaven feed to get

1286
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,210
into

1287
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,060
joel i now literally have to bust

1288
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,850
through everything that i'm doing which

1289
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,100
is basically making a lot of noise in

1290
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,470
the network which is what I want which

1291
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,420
sets me up the traditional methodology

1292
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,460
for event management tipping off the

1293
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,460
socks in response and mitigation and

1294
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,220
stuff like that right in a nutshell what

1295
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,870
I'm doing is I'm making the cost to you

1296
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,940
higher than it is for me to maintain it

1297
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,660
which means you're going to go to

1298
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,100
somebody else to get them because I'm

1299
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:24,400
just too hard yeah that's a good point

1300
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,140
so he wants to know the question is how

1301
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,120
would you take this and do the older

1302
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,950
stuff right I think this is what this is

1303
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,690
exactly designed for right so critical

1304
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,040
infrastructure when you think about it a

1305
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,380
lot of what underpins critical

1306
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,000
infrastructure is actually that legacy

1307
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,610
unsupported stuff right it's old old

1308
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,930
mainframes and stuff that just works

1309
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,980
they never turn it off

1310
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,290
it's Windows XP running things right

1311
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,600
it's that kind of stuff with micro

1312
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,060
segmentation you as long as it's talking

1313
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,180
tcp/ip you're basically able to bring

1314
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,190
down that attack surface and shrink it

1315
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,500
so you may not actually do IP packing

1316
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,210
you know work load the workload but you

1317
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,970
may sit there and go guess what all my

1318
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,250
Windows XP machines I'm going to segment

1319
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,530
micro segment off all the Windows XP so

1320
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,150
that they're one community of interest

1321
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,740
so that if somebody does go in there

1322
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,020
with an XP exploit it doesn't cross at

1323
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,580
all those boundaries right so I can

1324
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,230
control it because I'm a control freak

1325
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,460
at the end of the day I want to do two

1326
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,350
things I want to see the network and

1327
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,640
then I want to control the network

1328
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,540
that's it

1329
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,570
that to me is security right if we give

1330
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,010
really sexy with it then we're able to

1331
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,810
get to the point like right now we can't

1332
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,820
forecast weather right it's crazy right

1333
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,380
maybe one day out we can take the

1334
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,990
weather service but I can tell you like

1335
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,840
with Hurricane Irma if the weather comes

1336
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,570
this way here are the flood zones and

1337
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,250
what will be flooded to what level

1338
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,410
and I think about that now if I'm a

1339
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,720
security guy if I was a CSO imagine

1340
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,550
being able to go back to the c-suite say

1341
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,660
sir we don't have a hundred percent but

1342
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,340
if we get hit with a ransomware attack

1343
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,560
let me show you heat map of what will be

1344
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,280
compromised to what level imagine having

1345
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,020
that conversation nobody has that

1346
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,820
conversation but that's what we want to

1347
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,950
be because the weather man can do it and

1348
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,060
then guess what happens to people in

1349
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,980
Florida go it's ready I'm gonna go over

1350
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,920
right and so I may now go wow if that's

1351
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,450
read you're telling me if we get a

1352
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,890
ransomware attack that's what the

1353
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,570
infection areas going look like let's

1354
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,849
take the servers out of that zone and

1355
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:20,290
let's put them over in the yellow zone

1356
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,840
right that's a whole different security

1357
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,770
conversation that we're currently having

1358
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,450
right now there it is

1359
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,099
let's mine get out of jail free card so

1360
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:32,340
folks thank you

1361
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:37,959
[Applause]
