1
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,030
so

2
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:57,619
[Music]

3
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,180
[Music]

4
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,460
[Music]

5
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,780
[Music]

6
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,180
[Music]

7
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,730
that actually is doing containers it's

8
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,060
the most

9
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,679
[Music]

10
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,629
[Music]

11
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,580
you're staging on production and get

12
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,610
bugs goes back into dev that whole loop

13
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,790
and cycle is key and paramount as part

14
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,640
of the DevOps process being it to be

15
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,330
fast and quick helps things out docker

16
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,360
helps make that happen a perfect sample

17
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,850
bug fixes you want to be able to a bug

18
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,660
comes in you want to get it out ASAP

19
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,820
doctor can help facilitate that security

20
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,540
updates oh my god you know open SSL

21
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,140
vulnerability

22
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,690
maybe I'm vulnerable stat let me go

23
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,270
ahead and patch my container ship it

24
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,160
back out so I'm going to fix that patch

25
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,100
really quick that's another thing where

26
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,950
docker helps facilitate that very fast

27
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,020
sorry I collect one too many times

28
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,240
configuration management so talk a

29
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,590
little bit about docker now I'm gonna

30
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,199
talk about configuration manager

31
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,789
configuration management and the top

32
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,819
level is just a way to ensure that it's

33
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,270
a process that ensures your changes are

34
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,220
consistent it's you know based off of

35
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,889
what you build what you want for your

36
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,750
production or your development

37
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,490
environment whatever it is that you're

38
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,139
building you have a set of requirements

39
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,090
you have a set of what it needs to be

40
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,280
configured as and configuration

41
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,349
management is ensuring up actually build

42
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:56,620
that way one of the big tools that I use

43
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,970
its puppet

44
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,120
I like puppet but puppet is the only one

45
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,580
that you can use this talk I'll may only

46
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,800
be using puppet to show pace with

47
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,889
examples but there's other tools out

48
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,550
there as well such as chef and honestly

49
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,169
ant Ville is a little bit newer now it's

50
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,159
only been a couple years now on the

51
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,289
block hasn't been around too much so

52
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,729
most people might be more familiar with

53
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,620
puppets been around for waterway brought

54
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,639
a while now so again big thing while

55
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,870
like of it is the cleared of language

56
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,659
you know it's also it has the plant

57
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,049
server paradigm and it has a REST API if

58
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,000
you want to you know do a whole lot more

59
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,050
advanced things it's a mature framework

60
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,709
there's a lot of contributors to it

61
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,089
there's a public forge where you can

62
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,500
find a whole bunch of modules that

63
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,640
people have contributed to and actually

64
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,500
download them use them there's a whole

65
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,040
lot of examples out there so it's pretty

66
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,680
user friendly for someone that is just

67
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,520
starting out again the most work you

68
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,990
have the public master and a public

69
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,270
slave your slaves are all the notes and

70
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,250
when they run the puppet agent that's

71
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,680
running on the system you do have to

72
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,290
have an agent on the system some people

73
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,820
don't like that so if you're using

74
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,810
public be aware of that so if you're

75
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,940
running an agent on the system it runs

76
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,090
it goes back to pub master pull-downs

77
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,000
catalog what is my configuration

78
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,150
supposed to look like what am I supposed

79
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,970
to have so that's the sign on the puppet

80
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,310
master itself it then goes through and

81
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,710
defines on that whether it's you know

82
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,500
setting up particular sort of permission

83
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,590
whether it's you know installing

84
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,510
particular applications whatever the

85
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,610
case may be it then feeds it back into

86
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,490
the puppet master saying hey this is

87
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,280
what I change and this is what I did so

88
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,500
it's continues across but it helps

89
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,060
ensure that you have a set standard and

90
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,970
that standard is repeatable because on

91
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,800
the public master I'll get into this in

92
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
demonstration you can create a manifest

93
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,420
that can be applied to multiple

94
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,030
different notes which means you only

95
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,920
have to do it once and apply the same

96
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,080
change across everything which is very

97
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,580
beneficial especially in a large

98
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,830
environment when you start sealing to

99
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,110
you know tens hundreds you know

100
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,120
thousands of hosts we go right at once

101
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,390
and use it multiple times it's a little

102
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,530
bit about security so security a lot of

103
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,370
people this might be review some

104
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,580
examples good security concepts when

105
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,290
studying through secured us you are

106
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,630
disabled and necessary services you know

107
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,600
why

108
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,550
you're not using it it's bad you

109
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,520
shouldn't do it also remove unnecessary

110
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,020
packages a patch

111
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,430
even if it's on there and it's not

112
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,740
running probably still a bad thing he

113
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,230
probably shouldn't have it on there

114
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,160
keeping things as lightweight as

115
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,190
possible is in my opinion a good

116
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,870
practice for security when you're

117
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,390
setting up your environment for

118
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,300
operations even in development it's a

119
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,020
good up setting the limits on who has

120
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,350
access to what so again you don't want

121
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,450
every user to have access to every file

122
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,670
that is probably a bad thing you know if

123
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,280
someone happens to have access that they

124
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,520
shouldn't then things good leaves or

125
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,040
they do bad things in a production

126
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,270
environment that's definitely not what

127
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,630
you want in developmental environment

128
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,740
probably not what you want so you should

129
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,090
probably treat your development

130
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,560
environment the same as your production

131
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,950
environment if you can one of the things

132
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,220
is configuration SSH is a good example

133
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,270
of this

134
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,460
does he fall configuration for a reason

135
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,560
it will work for a majority of people

136
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
but all because it's a default

137
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,700
configuration does not mean it's secure

138
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,840
configuration should probably not be a

139
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,380
labs login as SSH

140
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,810
sometimes by default it can so going

141
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,610
through those default configurations and

142
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,230
ensuring they're set to what you want

143
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,670
for based on your particular entities is

144
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,760
paramount and important puppet helps

145
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,690
facilitate that one of the things that I

146
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,440
use in puppet is it's open sourced as

147
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,460
you can see here you go to github com

148
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,840
it's a collection of puppet modules

149
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,459
they're also on the public

150
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,839
port as well and basically it's a it's a

151
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,819
framework that enables a lot of default

152
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:04,740
compliance and security standards from

153
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,069
the get go out of the box by using sim

154
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,619
you can actually for the most part be

155
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:14,360
completely almost 100% complying with

156
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,600
most of like nest 853 regression for

157
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,339
like all the different standards that

158
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,730
they recommend you should do which in my

159
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,470
opinion is a good thing it gets you to a

160
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,499
good known starting location they also

161
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,569
include some tools in the sent framework

162
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:33,059
such as you know opens gap which is you

163
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,399
know the framework to actually be able

164
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,369
to run reports they have compliance he

165
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,499
built in so you can actually do matching

166
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,410
one to one from you know if you happen

167
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,119
to be using hippo or you happen to be

168
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:45,569
using

169
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,819
you know sig you know you can do that

170
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:50,009
one-to-one mapping between what your

171
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,589
compliance is dictates and what might be

172
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:54,959
you referenced within like NIST or

173
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,329
whatever standard so that's why I use

174
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:01,920
location and you know what you can do

175
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,119
from there on he's probably an oddity as

176
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:12,389
well so what are the common things a lot

177
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,309
of people like to audit package

178
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,100
installations login authentications

179
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,309
and if I'm using puppet I want to know

180
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,379
what puppet changed and if it changed

181
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,399
anything whatsoever I want to make sure

182
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:34,049
I disable the service some of the things

183
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:36,809
I use for auto box is a lot of people

184
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,389
might be familiar with the elk stack I

185
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,740
use elk just because I like rare fauna a

186
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,929
little bit more than kibana as far as

187
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:46,700
for view

188
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,000
alongs one of the big things why Allegra

189
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,170
fauna is hopefully no one is in your

190
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,050
prints belong or elastic yeah cuz I

191
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,070
don't like kebab with her fauna it's

192
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,840
open source which means there's a lot

193
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,450
more flexibility one of the things with

194
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,100
her fauna that you can actually do is by

195
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,760
default

196
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,980
lock it down to where you can do you

197
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,520
know use your authentication sometimes

198
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,220
with Cubana you have to buy the x-pac

199
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,960
and do some other drinks for free I'm

200
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,180
all about free if it's free I don't have

201
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,070
to pay for it I can use it also it's a

202
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,320
better business sale for sometimes in

203
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,660
companies

204
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,700
what's the bang for the buck and a lot

205
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,260
of people they ask well if I'm gonna

206
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,080
spend X dollars why does it really help

207
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,390
me security you might not see it

208
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,420
initially so selling freeze sometimes a

209
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,900
little bit easier so container security

210
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,570
this time where I think daughter is

211
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,780
gonna be a huge player in the field

212
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,900
moving forward if it already hasn't a

213
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,160
lot of people are getting up to speed

214
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,830
with it and it greatly improves your

215
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:10,010
security posture so not only can you do

216
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,990
with a post security but then you can

217
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,950
also have doctor security goals one of

218
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,460
the biggest things that it helps with is

219
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,380
using kernel features such as C groups

220
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,290
and you know needs these I'll talk about

221
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,120
those here in a minute but those are two

222
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,820
critical things that helps ensure your

223
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,160
doctor containers are running in a semi

224
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,610
isolated safe to help ensure that one's

225
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,650
not talking to the other all still in

226
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,800
the same host of webs you can also start

227
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,750
applying you know a Palmer which is by

228
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,580
default built-ins on the doctor or the

229
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,700
doctor daemon itself or selinux if you

230
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,620
haven't do running you know on that on

231
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,990
your host OS as well and there's a lot

232
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,370
of great talks out there if you want to

233
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,620
do

234
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,560
YouTube for docker a bomber doctor

235
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,500
docker selinux on they'll walk you

236
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,870
through actually setting up those for

237
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,290
your environment if you choose alright

238
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,540
so kernel namespace why does it matter

239
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,760
namespaces are really something I

240
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,770
started learning about a couple years

241
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,990
ago also as I started learning docker

242
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,690
doesn't realize the kernel features that

243
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,280
were available that doctor was actually

244
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,079
using and once I read about them I was

245
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,620
like holy cow like why didn't we use

246
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,420
this why haven't I been using this to

247
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,390
begin with you use without realizing it

248
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,810
but other times you don't so don't be

249
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:49,080
utilizing it utilizes it having the

250
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,960
builders actually mount a volume inside

251
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,100
your dog container then it sees and if

252
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,960
your namespace is written in such a way

253
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,320
it won't see the other things

254
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,210
surrounding where that comes into play

255
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,660
is for example the root filesystem a lot

256
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,220
of times you know you don't want

257
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,680
everyone looking approved but there

258
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,300
might be certain things that you want to

259
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,760
mount and for example if you're running

260
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,460
a container that is you know just

261
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,700
parsing logs you might want to mount you

262
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,520
know var log as a read-only so I can

263
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,750
actually read the Box the map see it

264
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:38,430
helps do that the application that's

265
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,490
running always starts as pin1

266
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,870
it's the first thing that starts up in

267
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,860
the container

268
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,370
well inside docker container the pig

269
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,090
namespace is unique to the post so

270
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,060
within the docker namespace it actually

271
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,330
shows up as one external it might be you

272
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,190
know one two three four five whatever

273
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,680
sequence that it actually

274
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,560
on the host OS which helps that

275
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,930
separation I mention it more so that you

276
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,970
are actually aware if you're trying to

277
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,490
debug and you're on the host OS trying

278
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,380
to debug what's going on you might have

279
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,790
a hundred different containers running

280
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,010
trying to understand the difference and

281
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,140
you're inside one container it shows up

282
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,270
this head one and it's not the same

283
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:28,890
extra so that's more just for is

284
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,130
critical because you can allow an

285
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,520
application to run as root internal to

286
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,800
your container that isn't root on the

287
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,570
host OS so that is a big one there used

288
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,130
to be some people that were scared about

289
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,280
you know getting you know elevated

290
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,820
privileges to read in the host OS in

291
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,830
earlier verses a docker that actually

292
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,480
was a problem that was actually patched

293
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,100
early on one dot X cycle so if you're

294
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,260
concerned about that look it up you're

295
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,060
seeing you read people how it's actually

296
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,740
been patched what the BraunAbility was

297
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,390
and why it's not an isolated issue

298
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:15,030
anymore so one of the things I like

299
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,430
about C groups is similar to like in

300
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,980
VMware or whatever the case may be you

301
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,910
can limit your actually VM so the amount

302
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,830
of memory in or CPU that they actually

303
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,130
end up taking so control groups allow

304
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,020
that within a doctor container so you

305
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,240
where it's really useful is for example

306
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,480
as an Operations perspective you can set

307
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,840
control groups on a particular set of

308
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,970
containers immediately like memory we

309
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,280
all know Java sometimes likes to eat up

310
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,650
a lot of memory well if you run a

311
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,480
hundred containers that all eat up 32

312
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,490
gigs of memory and you only have 32 gigs

313
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,410
on your system that's probably not going

314
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,810
to be a good thing you can sexy groups

315
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,610
to limit the amount of memory per

316
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,990
container and in essence kill the

317
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,550
containers you know when they get to a

318
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,090
certain part and restart them that's a

319
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,760
whole separate talk with Java and Java

320
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,650
containers in memory but it's something

321
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,950
to be aware of as you can

322
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,750
put limits which is very good all right

323
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,950
so now putting it all together again

324
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,710
like I said I use simple external

325
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,140
modules with puppet to initially set up

326
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,840
my secure our webs wouldn't see here is

327
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,050
a set of code initially within within a

328
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,330
puppet by default there is the site

329
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,550
manifest the site manifest is kind of

330
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,670
your defaults that applies globally

331
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,070
across your entire environment puppet

332
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,660
also has the construct of you can have

333
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,790
multiple environments

334
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,530
I'll get into that but to be aware of if

335
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,050
you can use the same puppet master for

336
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,390
both a production environment and a dev

337
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,840
environment based on how you set it up

338
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,480
as you can see here the environment I'm

339
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,580
in a descent which actually has to be

340
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,170
the production environment as well it's

341
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,210
just assembly but in here you can

342
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,720
actually see the type of clients profile

343
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,940
okay I talked about clients previously

344
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,840
what this compliance profile is you can

345
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,400
read the same documentation to get more

346
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,930
better understanding it's just

347
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,550
compliance to markup so you can actually

348
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,880
see you know what is actually hitting if

349
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,100
things are failing itself but I'm saying

350
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,350
I'm accent which means I want it

351
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,500
compliant and fully secure between I

352
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,540
want to use all the sim framework which

353
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,490
from setting something up from the

354
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,900
ground up and you're just starting out

355
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,700
that's what I would recommend and you

356
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,320
can start you know going from there

357
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,110
again this is the same site that PP you

358
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,750
see down there very bottom some other

359
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:07,120
options that are uses here as a database

360
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,910
it allows you to set different variables

361
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,870
for different notes and/or environments

362
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,540
and a higher level contract which allows

363
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,140
you to reuse that same manifest across

364
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,120
multiple different nodes like I've

365
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,600
mentioned earlier so once you actually

366
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,770
have your site

367
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:38,890
peep-peep you have and your see that

368
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,780
there's these are all the ones that I

369
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,400
have to find right now which is this

370
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,810
small test environment which I have

371
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,080
running on the laptop is the for host

372
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,570
names that I have running and I'm gonna

373
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,320
take a look right here at the puppet

374
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,830
site one basically what this shows is it

375
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,720
shows the classes that I actually want

376
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,000
to include that we're not part of the

377
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,060
standard site Fifi's and as you see here

378
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,250
I've included quite a few you know one

379
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,050
of the big ones that I you know decide

380
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,880
to add which is the FTP boot which just

381
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,590
allows me to pixie boot which is high

382
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,860
boot strapped all my other themes are

383
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,620
teacake is a key thing to mention real

384
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,260
quick if you're using puppet I recommend

385
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,600
you to take a look at our 10k it allows

386
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,030
you to actually sync your code directly

387
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,650
with a github or any other git

388
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,270
repository whether it's an internal base

389
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,460
kit or an external base yet you can

390
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,190
actually do that CIC be for public

391
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,440
manifests of modules as well and tie it

392
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,910
to particular tags and versions alright

393
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,540
so for puppet with docker how do you do

394
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:43,930
it

395
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:51,760
Gareth it is approved by on the puppet

396
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,970
forge there's actually a puppet docker

397
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,780
module that's based off of Garris I use

398
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,490
his as you to actually set up docker it

399
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,300
facilitates the framework around

400
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,570
installing docker as well as running all

401
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:10,970
your

402
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,740
patience so real quick in essence of

403
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,200
time I will go through the demonstration

404
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,340
because the demonstration is mainly

405
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:48,860
focused on this aspect so what I'm

406
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,780
logging here is I have both my puppet VM

407
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,929
and as well as my daugher VM within

408
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:01,250
puppet you'll see that I'm in the

409
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,980
production environment in the modules

410
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,640
and a site module which is the one that

411
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,730
has everything defined and your notice I

412
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,280
have both docker production and docker

413
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,890
engine X docker production all it

414
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,950
basically does is installs docker and

415
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,350
sets up the environment for docker here

416
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,940
at the very bottom you're noticed that I

417
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,860
have IP tables rules

418
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,280
that's because IP tables are needed to

419
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,470
for communication between docker hosts

420
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,159
and the actual outside you can't have

421
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,230
two things managed IP tables and puppet

422
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,090
manages IP tables so therefore you have

423
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,600
to add those in manually the docker

424
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,559
engine X is actually what installs my

425
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,470
containers themselves and over here on

426
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,210
your see that I actually don't have any

427
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,330
docker containers running no docker

428
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:05,720
images so over here I'll go into my

429
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,080
hosts if I can type

430
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,220
edit my daugher post configure see that

431
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,790
I have the docker engine X commented out

432
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,270
once I uncomment it go back over to my

433
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,400
docker host I'm gonna elevate to route

434
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,520
just because I'm forcing puppet to run

435
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,530
but in general publicly run

436
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,610
automatically in the background so it's

437
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,750
gonna go through this is what I was

438
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,280
talking about earlier it's talking back

439
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,690
to the master saying hey what's my

440
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,720
configuration what does it need to be so

441
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,330
I can actually you know grab everything

442
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:52,150
down and set it while it's doing that I

443
00:27:52,150 --> 00:28:02,890
will show you my Firefox browser and I

444
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,960
can see my mouse you see that I'm trying

445
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,380
to get to the my docker VM itself that's

446
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,420
IP address but it's not actually coming

447
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,540
up that's because it's just now applying

448
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,730
the docker containers themselves again

449
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,770
if I do a talk at PS minus a or C it's

450
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,830
up your see that the one I really care

451
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,170
about is the first one that's port 80

452
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,880
translated to port 80 and you also see

453
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,020
that my IP tables also are allowing port

454
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,970
80 to now communicate as you can see

455
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,720
right here so if I go back over here

456
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,850
refresh now I can actually see in

457
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,580
genetics that was all facilitated by

458
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,730
installing the docker container the

459
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,240
image itself if I go back over here you

460
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,600
see I now have a docker image that's on

461
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,790
there you're see down here I actually

462
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,530
don't have any network access so this

463
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,730
was all done in a closed environment

464
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,580
which is some cases very important so I

465
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,840
did this by side loading the docker

466
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,280
image using a tarball

467
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,780
so that's kind of it in a nutshell I

468
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,510
know it was kind of really rushed but

469
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:29,960
let me get through to the very rim are

470
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:50,830
there any questions walk away yes so and

471
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,830
so

472
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,529
[Music]

473
00:31:01,770 --> 00:32:26,160
I know we're out of time but you see me

474
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,710
afterwards I can answer questions
