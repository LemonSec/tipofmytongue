1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,860
thank you it's also like a smile it's my

2
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,489
first time here besides her gusta thanks

3
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,470
to the organization for having me here

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,170
and let's see it for for coming

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,250
so today I'm going to talk about many

6
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,900
different things it's probably too much

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:01:00,350
to cover in just 50 minutes but for our

8
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,320
first goal is a software company open

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:16,070
source and we do staff in the cloud me a

10
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:23,270
long time ago so yes I have done and

11
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,720
also I've done so I love security I was

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:37,990
guilty and so this is why I'm here story

13
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,520
during this last two years so I got this

14
00:01:43,520 --> 00:02:05,299
email from my boss that you here you go

15
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,649
just pinkie and also I had another email

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,829
doing something like a for scanning

17
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,820
something so this is what you have

18
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,539
[Music]

19
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,660
all the time whatever you are working

20
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,720
you know things about these are

21
00:02:43,720 --> 00:03:00,850
forensics in the cloud and then with

22
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,680
where we are gonna see some attacks and

23
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,830
or others incident response and also of

24
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,890
course your environment your

25
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,170
infrastructure etc first of all let's

26
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,320
talk a little bit about one of the

27
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:46,120
statistics of the cloud is so stations

28
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
etc in the cloud you cannot do that so

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:04:06,580
you have the same for this is a sure so

30
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,780
I have used some example of AWS assured

31
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,510
and Google cloud but prolly is the same

32
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,149
so when it comes to deploying

33
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,150
applications

34
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:38,210
[Music]

35
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,830
Braham may take months

36
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:55,240
that means more environments like

37
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,960
pci-dss

38
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,839
[Music]

39
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,670
so we have to pay a lot of attention our

40
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,840
systems so let's see some some generics

41
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,960
for example the wick wa t as we have

42
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,380
seen

43
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,680
so the lega lega jurisdiction of course

44
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,420
is different because we may have

45
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,960
information in many different countries

46
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,900
the elasticity is also interesting point

47
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,000
to discuss because when you have

48
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,670
[Music]

49
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,889
and many other planets I'm not going to

50
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,160
go through the to the entire table but

51
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,479
it's good thing good least consider it's

52
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:46,949
like other differences from the

53
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,880
identification preservation position etc

54
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,039
so like the other day way too high a few

55
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,650
details here like documentation of the

56
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,330
sing of course in the cloud you don't

57
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,620
have any exist in the cloud so you can

58
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,320
save the time while you are documenting

59
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:30,090
this part you don't have to do in this

60
00:07:30,090 --> 00:08:05,280
case some sometimes some tasks are

61
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,830
better or faster in the cloud and others

62
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,260
are more difficult also we need to know

63
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,200
where is the

64
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,000
formation in depending of course on the

65
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,050
calendar you can find information in

66
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,670
many different places but pretty much

67
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,360
all the clock vendors have same kind of

68
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,140
services you need to know the key points

69
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,870
on the object stories what is an object

70
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:48,290
storage different tasks that you have to

71
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,510
perform depending on where you are going

72
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,130
to find also the broad storage EBS

73
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:02,420
volumes orbital size etc so we can find

74
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,830
information please just we can find

75
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,410
information in many different places and

76
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,550
also remember here ephemeral hard drives

77
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,840
which is information that when you

78
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,360
terminate an instance because way so

79
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,660
this may find interesting information

80
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,260
there as well or databases or queues

81
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,400
cash engine services etc so this is not

82
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:53,600
just like different services and once -

83
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,420
aww specifics I have worked a little bit

84
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,729
we maximize your

85
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:02,639
my job is being a double yes so I'm

86
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,389
gonna go straight to specifics to tell

87
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:20,039
you about some attacks so first good so

88
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,279
in order to understand most of the

89
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,479
attacks and how AWS work protecting

90
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:32,129
services and protecting the different

91
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,279
options that the offer is we need to

92
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,829
understand the keys so first of all when

93
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:46,379
you create you should have protected by

94
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,539
a multi-factor authentication code

95
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,999
hardware or software MFA the most

96
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:02,459
important point here is the I am which

97
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:15,929
is a username and password but also the

98
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:19,049
access keys remember an access key is

99
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:27,839
what it's a pair of keys you use the

100
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,179
disk is for everything but you may have

101
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,269
the STS which is a token that gives you

102
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,489
temporary access to something to our

103
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:43,529
resource of course and is used to be

104
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,659
attached to an instance even if an

105
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:52,679
instance or if you use Samuel

106
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,320
authentication like there

107
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,900
issues Robbie you have also your user

108
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,930
have also okay your access keys depends

109
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,800
on photo kiosk as well and the key pair

110
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,460
that is nothing to do with better press

111
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,140
this is all related to a Darrell

112
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,630
properly and the keepers are the SSH

113
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,830
keepers okay

114
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,720
sometimes people is confused with

115
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,730
different things up SSH

116
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:33,320
the keepers are only to access but it's

117
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,390
not the same so when I'm talking about

118
00:12:35,390 --> 00:13:22,250
keep API keys okay but also from the

119
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:32,800
metadata server we can get access keys

120
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,140
so now that we know some basics about

121
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,440
let's see some attacks some common

122
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,510
incidents that we can fine are the

123
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,460
access keys compromise of course as we

124
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,890
have seen there are many ways to do that

125
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,160
and we are we are see some of the these

126
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,010
ways phishing attacks you can send

127
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,340
emails trying to to you know to force an

128
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,520
user to change password or to give you

129
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,660
keys etc through compromised resources

130
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,590
using poison

131
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,490
am i or ec2 instances many different

132
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,600
ways as you can see here also the

133
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,630
subdomain the covert applique

134
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,760
applications running in a role I will

135
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,190
show you some applications some examples

136
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,420
and misconfigurations everything is at

137
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,070
the end of the day or not everything but

138
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,930
in most cases are errors related to the

139
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,720
configuration ok so of course I couldn't

140
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,590
miss the s3 leaks you have heard this

141
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,140
probably in during the last months many

142
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,120
times like the Time Warner issues

143
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,330
Verizon auto lender and also there is a

144
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,910
very good list here about all the the

145
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:05,490
latest s3 leaks that has happened and

146
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:13,440
also if you want to see how far let's

147
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,220
see from a bucket you can look at this

148
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,500
tool it's a good proof of concept of how

149
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,710
you can discover buckets and discover

150
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,839
the permissions of the packets I will

151
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,290
also show you a tool a problem that can

152
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,450
help you to figure out the configuration

153
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,730
if you have properly or not configure

154
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,530
your packets but in terms of security

155
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,850
but this is kind of an attack tool or

156
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,950
recon tool is very very interesting if

157
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,650
you want to take a look to it and this

158
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,150
is some aces of new tool from Amazon and

159
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,640
it's the amp the AWS answer to all these

160
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,470
issues around the PII information leaked

161
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,190
from s3 buckets etc so it uses Amazon

162
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,740
may see what it does is to look at you

163
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,140
inside your pocket and also in the your

164
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,709
packets configuration

165
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,649
gives you very good information

166
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,300
regarding as I said the configuration

167
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,360
and if you have kind of credit cards in

168
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,320
the data or another life using machine

169
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,790
learning other places some places that

170
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,170
you can find and look released is so

171
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,970
places where you can find access keys

172
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,140
user data of course the user data is if

173
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,140
you are familiar with Amazon when you

174
00:16:43,140 --> 00:17:22,439
launch an instance so this is the same

175
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,329
thing with confirmation or the metadata

176
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:30,510
server itself public EBS volumes public

177
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:44,580
am eyes you can attach to your instance

178
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,860
you may have information personal

179
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,450
information or even keys etc and also in

180
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,610
your workstation if you use a Linux or

181
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,400
Mac you have prudential here or in a

182
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,010
window windows here and many other

183
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,940
places as you can see here even you can

184
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,520
search in github

185
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,179
look at this truffle hog in github you

186
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,040
can see how a good example of how to

187
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,520
find keys not only in github Amazon

188
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,640
looks of

189
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,179
for you to find try to find keys and you

190
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:32,070
know so what's up with that

191
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,099
[Music]

192
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,720
shortcut Hey and this I've been playing

193
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,179
with this so don't tell my my mates but

194
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:22,510
I'm going to use this so once we perform

195
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,130
an attack we can do or we should do

196
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,970
persistence

197
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,250
try to move to do a lateral movement or

198
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,490
whatever so we can look as I said to the

199
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,030
meta-data service like this is just

200
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,549
doing a core I don't know if I have yes

201
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,380
cool call here to the metadata server

202
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,650
service this is as I said AWS is

203
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,980
specific Google OpenStack and other

204
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,370
vendors in Microsoft Azure they have

205
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,230
kind of metadata service that are five

206
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,360
inside every instance it's not dynamic

207
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
but it static but it is also in every

208
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,000
instance okay so this is not only a kind

209
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
of an AWS issue it's not an issue is

210
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,919
more related to configuration but it's

211
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,130
just something that exists okay so if

212
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,519
you have as I said a role like that

213
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:42,419
stanza control station okay

214
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,359
so if you get these keys and you use

215
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,789
them in other attack automation tools

216
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:54,690
you can access that you can perform in

217
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,039
downtown or as we are going to see to

218
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,089
perform malicious activities so the fake

219
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,519
latter moving snapshots attach volumes

220
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,039
to your own you can you can get if you

221
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,809
have permissions to to do that you can

222
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,629
share an EBS volume to attach to another

223
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:15,599
easy to instance you don't even need the

224
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,700
root password to do that because it's

225
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,719
like you connect and if you just want to

226
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,820
server this is why is very important to

227
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,709
have EBS volumes encrypted for example

228
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:32,519
and you can also use Metasploit to make

229
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,039
some of these things so server less who

230
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,009
is a living server less here you know

231
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,070
what is ever less you are familiar more

232
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,109
less with server test server less is a

233
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,570
service to run functions different

234
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,879
functions in Python or C sharp or many

235
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:51,450
other languages like no GS without

236
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,259
having to take care of the servers in my

237
00:21:55,259 --> 00:22:00,839
case a few months ago our developers

238
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:08,309
wanted to do so and they say okay Tony

239
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,079
we are going to move this code to

240
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,860
production so what can we do should I

241
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,600
I didn't know what to do pad but I try

242
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,000
to make sure that these it was in Python

243
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,480
this Python code was in backdoor or

244
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,990
something

245
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,120
I am doing something weird like charging

246
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,419
too much or doing any configuration

247
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,260
change and also in terms of the the

248
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:54,090
permissions function comprehensive and

249
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,200
we what I do is just to make sure that

250
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,740
there are no many stars in the policy

251
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:12,929
because in most cases at least it's more

252
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,659
expedient so and they allow everything

253
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:21,029
so this everything so you have to just

254
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:25,529
take care of that so this is another

255
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,049
very interesting attack is a little bit

256
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:32,010
old but it's also using Saba and just

257
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,669
having the kids the access keys you can

258
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:38,789
do you can disable of course with the

259
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:42,029
proper permissions disable call trail

260
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,039
encrypt all trails generate new

261
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,200
developer access keys stop instances

262
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,549
terminate instances and bar them all

263
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:54,840
everything with just one button so this

264
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,100
is why I said before so you can automate

265
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,100
the creation but you also can automate

266
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,490
the destruction so this is just a

267
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,860
screenshot of of this and look tired

268
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,639
some companies have to have had to close

269
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,370
yes because they didn't have properly

270
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,929
configured a infrastructure or not seen

271
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,280
properly

272
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,680
splitted in different accounts etc this

273
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,130
is another another very good attack is

274
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,860
kind of a proof of concept using lambda

275
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,640
and if you are interesting in lambda

276
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,510
security watch this video from the coast

277
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,750
computer conference but decode is not a

278
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,280
value but the video is still interesting

279
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,290
and there are many other attack tools or

280
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,210
provoking sets very interesting that you

281
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,520
can see here I'm not gonna go through

282
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,340
through them because I want to tell you

283
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,030
more about Harlan I'm incident response

284
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,610
so once you find an issue or or you have

285
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,210
the issue how can you identify the issue

286
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,210
first with AWS or the vendor

287
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,780
notifications they are they have very

288
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,750
good security teams and they are looking

289
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,510
after everything more than while you may

290
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,980
think and very proactive all the time

291
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,950
also looking at IEM activity and a new

292
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,290
the new cloud ideas which is the billing

293
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,550
activity if someone take your key your

294
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:44,250
keys and start creating instances you

295
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,720
are gonna see that in your building

296
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,590
of course API logs as I said everything

297
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,420
goes through the API so you have to look

298
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,730
at the logs and of course dedicated

299
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,160
tools we are going to see some of them

300
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,670
and the traditional tools like Norris

301
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,710
ricotta or pursue which is a fort on

302
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,140
asteroids we with office a query or a

303
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,390
hunt reality and everything that you

304
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,610
already know so yeah III know this is is

305
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,429
too big but is

306
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,260
[Music]

307
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,819
[Music]

308
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,110
still to do and also depending on the

309
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,250
case you may need to leave the instance

310
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,490
life or to stop the instance open maybe

311
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,760
you already have the instance topic and

312
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,770
they call you to to look at it once in

313
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,110
stop it so we have automated the memory

314
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,770
capture and some other data like like

315
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,880
metadata etc and also you can also use

316
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,820
forensics distribution in the cloud same

317
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,260
more or less the same way you have to

318
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,880
attach volumes to do to create timelines

319
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,980
etc so of course we need to do a lot of

320
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,160
more things but this is not bad so I'm

321
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,680
gonna show you a demo how to how we have

322
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,590
automated all of these things and in the

323
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,700
cloud you have also to to acquire more

324
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,060
information like not only the twelve

325
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,690
Trail which is a API trail the VPC flow

326
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,570
log if you are not familiar with PPC is

327
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,490
a way to create networks private neck

328
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,480
Orson in the cloud three logs RDS locked

329
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,360
everything that you can get but also the

330
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,670
instance profile information endpoints

331
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,440
if you have n points configure the

332
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,320
syslog screen and metadata from the

333
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,120
hypervisor standpoint

334
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,690
we don't have in the cloud of course

335
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,160
information from the hypervisor but

336
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,830
Amazon in AWS you can get some

337
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,860
information from the visor like even an

338
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,950
S screen screen shot of the the console

339
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,330
in the in a particular moment windows

340
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,820
which may be interesting when you are

341
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,530
doing an investigation and many other

342
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,500
information you know that data like

343
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,500
limits in this account you need to look

344
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,130
for resources created from a given date

345
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,330
from the data for example that you

346
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,480
figure out that your keys were stolen

347
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,299
for example and everything from inside

348
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,990
every every instance so you have to to

349
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,210
acquire our information and you can

350
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,070
automate pretty much everything of this

351
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,990
so the tool I'm going to show you a

352
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,210
space was presented in black hat and

353
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,730
it's based more or less in the idea that

354
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,429
I wrote in an article back in 2016 and

355
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:41,590
with some with a proof concept of how to

356
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,030
automate what I have shown you and I had

357
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:53,770
this kind of example shell script using

358
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,760
the AWS CLI and the guise of red

359
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,350
responds presented this to lab and also

360
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,910
a new version this year you have these

361
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,650
all the tools here and documentation etc

362
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,830
and what I'm going to show you is how to

363
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,669
collect the how to respond to key

364
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,530
compromise and how to respond to an

365
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,020
instance compromise what we can do is

366
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,429
using plugins you can gather the instant

367
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:29,590
you can see here host but it's actually

368
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,460
an instance metadata string consul etc

369
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,710
also to tag the horse to make sure that

370
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,370
your information the gains and is tagged

371
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,340
and is under investigation

372
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,429
to add an AC

373
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,339
if it's inside our VPC dragon is easier

374
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,159
to make sure that only the examiner

375
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,589
investigator can access to it

376
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,899
the same way that isolated it's like to

377
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:56,749
move do you need to keep the instance

378
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:59,059
running but you have to make sure that

379
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,279
nobody's been or nothing is going to get

380
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,200
out of the instance but your

381
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
investigator instance for example

382
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,239
through SSH if you want and eventually

383
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:14,419
you stop paying see if you need to so

384
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:21,529
let's see first key compromise in this

385
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,489
case is not only two we see here you are

386
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,919
familiar with the with AWS console you

387
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:42,499
can see here the one account the video

388
00:31:42,499 --> 00:32:02,739
is not running I have it here

389
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,390
by the way this is where you can find

390
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,390
everything I'm talking here the video of

391
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,510
the innocence compromise I'm going to go

392
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,040
straight to the sound compromise so here

393
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:32,700
you can see you can see an instance with

394
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,580
it sounds a guilty group etc so what I

395
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,640
do let me stop it a little bit what I do

396
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,220
here is running it away higher which is

397
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,370
the the command to perform an action in

398
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,290
this case in that in some compromised

399
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:56,070
case I give it a bucket name to to do to

400
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,360
live there the the memory dump you have

401
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,720
to give it room to the users SSH key and

402
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,760
plugins plugins at the angle a is the

403
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,430
order that different or the workflow of

404
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,870
the actions that you want to perform

405
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,240
like colored horse etc and in it depends

406
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,480
of course the size of the instance what

407
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,620
you do is just to take the to perform

408
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,740
all these different actions in minutes

409
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,650
so with the target which is the instance

410
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,710
is compromised it is try to find this

411
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,180
instant in all the different regions AWS

412
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,840
regions and perform the different

413
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,120
actions for example using I don't know

414
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,550
do you know a paramiku paramiku is an

415
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:53,640
SSH Tool Library for Python so threat

416
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,850
response the suite of tools it has one

417
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:02,250
two just two for the memory damn remote

418
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,170
memory gathering which is called

419
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,010
Margaret - of time

420
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,530
shotgun is based on parameter so here

421
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,330
you can see in this case was a one gig

422
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,179
one kilogram instance but this is why it

423
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:23,879
was very very fast the instance the

424
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,429
memory dump and the different options

425
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,520
the different acquisitions so the

426
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,918
console metadata also the screenshot etc

427
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,909
so here you can see automatically you

428
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,730
have changed the security group only to

429
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,399
the isolation security group which is

430
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,409
your investigator and it's stopping

431
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,310
they of course they the instance and you

432
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,050
have also unsnap shot create

433
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,639
automatically so what you can do with

434
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,240
this snapshot is attach it to kind of

435
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,600
the Sun shift for example or any other

436
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,140
foreign six distribution in the cloud

437
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,200
and to perform other tasks like to

438
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,980
create a timeline and export this at I'm

439
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,790
going to play so for example etc and

440
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,280
also creates the well in the s3 bucket

441
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,359
you can find the memory dump I don't

442
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,520
know if you are familiar with lying but

443
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,930
in this case what it does also

444
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,859
automatically is these guys have done a

445
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:39,490
repository of kernel modules based on

446
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,530
pretty much all the kernels available in

447
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,540
the market and they have it available in

448
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,109
an s3 bucket somewhere these two taste

449
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:53,440
every looks at your linens and take

450
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,330
to perform done you know to be able to

451
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,010
do a memory dump in Linux you need to

452
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,680
install a module so this is why

453
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,690
everything works so fast and you don't

454
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,930
need to do anything manually and now

455
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,850
with this damn using Rico or volatility

456
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,270
you can perform other other tasks okay

457
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:25,090
to find what the issue was exit okay let

458
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:37,450
me go back here okay

459
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,420
this more or less how to automate the

460
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,430
data acquisition to change some things

461
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,190
in the cloud in the in an automated

462
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,630
fashion hope you can prevent persistence

463
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,070
so having good configuration first of

464
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,360
all but look in the tell to your user

465
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,240
data there are ways to make sure that

466
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,710
you don't have anything like keys etc in

467
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,590
your user data so there are security

468
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,660
best practices when you design the

469
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,060
templates with confirmation also you can

470
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,460
prevent an application like Apache or

471
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,310
job application running with the user

472
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,820
[Music]

473
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,160
if you have everything with a CTS token

474
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,770
is you make everything more secure

475
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,850
temporarily unless from inside from

476
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,140
saying the same policy cold trail should

477
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,560
be enabled always so I think from since

478
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,700
a month or two months ago

479
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,130
every account new account that you

480
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,130
create in Amazon has a klutz I'll enable

481
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,890
so make sure that it is enabled because

482
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,350
it's the only way that you have to to

483
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:05,740
see who has done what through the API

484
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,770
separation of duties using multiple

485
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:15,860
accounts of course to implement a good

486
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,130
policy about security in the cloud you

487
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,320
need to go from the ground up from the

488
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,850
instance security to the network

489
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,190
security tab to the provider as we we

490
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,010
have seen some here some tools that we

491
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,730
we used and we decide also to use I'm

492
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,210
gonna I have another list of tools but

493
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,940
for example every instance every ami

494
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,980
that we build should have the cia's

495
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,600
benchmark for the operating system to

496
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,170
make sure that it's properly hard and

497
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,720
the hardening is applied no

498
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,070
configuration if so if you don't need to

499
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,080
configure it you don't need to access to

500
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,740
it despite some users have SSH access

501
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,700
but if you use a configuration

502
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,230
management system you don't need to -

503
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,530
SSH to any instance and also local tools

504
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,230
like query was who are key hunter etc

505
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,480
and of course sed knows always enabled

506
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,620
and remember that you can collect

507
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,080
everything from your provider but every

508
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,700
provider has also a API called limits a

509
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,740
ee-aw has a

510
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,630
columnist depending of the actual

511
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,300
different actions and of course red

512
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,780
teaming

513
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,820
you know APA calls I really have talked

514
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,030
about this who when what call what

515
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,330
resources and from where happens the

516
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,270
this is Claude trail and also every

517
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,660
every cloud provider has a tool but also

518
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,710
Microsoft has the operational insights

519
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,190
which is more than just API calls but

520
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,589
they they have tools for for everything

521
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:06,859
and also there are proprietary and open

522
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:20,869
source tools yes yes it's not bad but we

523
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:23,060
have we have played with just one

524
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,430
project with inspector and also we are

525
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,800
using was who the latest version of was

526
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,930
who as I said was who is a fork of

527
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,440
Cossack comes with with an integration

528
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,849
with opens cap opens cap is also a

529
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:43,010
hardening and compliance tool that look

530
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,950
at your configuration etc and can gives

531
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,560
you clues about if you have properly

532
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,020
hard secure your operating system base

533
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,210
of cis benchmarks or even needs or

534
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,960
different standards so we we use open

535
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,430
sky but we have also used your inspector

536
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,530
it's fine inspector at the angle that

537
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,300
you look at the also benchmark etc also

538
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,450
as I said to automate hardening auditing

539
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,599
etc you can use many different tools I'm

540
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,609
going to highlight a few of them only

541
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,119
and all that all the links are in the

542
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,220
github page and also is are in the

543
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,060
presentation everything is in github

544
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,460
already I like to highlight

545
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,430
first of all security monkey I cannot

546
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,910
live without security mount so give the

547
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,480
monkeys at all

548
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,280
by Netflix it works for aw sir recently

549
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,380
for a Google cloud as well and what it

550
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,110
does is to look for changes in the API

551
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,960
and your configuration and alerts for

552
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,060
for bad configurations or some some

553
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,730
changes it has some patterns to to know

554
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,310
if there are some bad configurations and

555
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,190
gives you some advices and alerts about

556
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,250
about those configurations Amazon has

557
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,350
done good things about some changes like

558
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,120
config rules and other other tools like

559
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm also amazed here as we have seen

560
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,620
before but security monkeys is for me is

561
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,270
the best tool to look after the

562
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,290
configuration itself know the API itself

563
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,320
and you can use it for multiple accounts

564
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,630
not just one also this is another good

565
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,820
tool cloud custodian to control policies

566
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,570
about your infrastructure they also plug

567
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:42,360
in for AWS and also ask a - or the AWS

568
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,840
see is benchmark which is a Python code

569
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,670
does more or less the same as problem

570
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,440
I'm going to show you a demo of problem

571
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,130
which is as I said like space also in

572
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,430
the benchmark and this has less checks

573
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,320
than Startalk but it's a little bit

574
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,060
easier to run because it's a shell

575
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,530
script you don't have to install

576
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,490
anything just having the AWS CLI work

577
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,680
time and just to highlight another thing

578
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,610
get secrets is a hook for get to prevent

579
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:19,650
your developers to send code when they

580
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,190
do commit to github to send keys okay so

581
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,810
it's a good recommendation for

582
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:30,090
developers yeah finally what I'm going

583
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,010
to show you a little bit about Pro layer

584
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:37,680
as I said is a shell script tool that I

585
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,520
have right here it's open source so I'm

586
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,890
not gonna sell you anything this one so

587
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:50,880
this

588
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,140
demo is about automating the hardening

589
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,349
itself so you can this is about hurting

590
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,900
and probably I have bottle thing in the

591
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,380
same video

592
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,009
so you can take CloudFormation template

593
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:10,539
which is this one from the URL they show

594
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:14,949
you of a WCS benchmark and it's a good

595
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:17,469
example of how to automate the hardening

596
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:20,709
of your AWS account to change account

597
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:24,160
policies like password policies and also

598
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,359
alerts in case someone changed V PC

599
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:30,489
configuration or security group or open

600
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:32,949
a security groove SSH for the entire

601
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:36,429
internet etc so you can automate all

602
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:38,049
this stuff you don't have to do your

603
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:42,039
hardening manually okay and then we move

604
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:48,779
forward because we are and this is

605
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:52,359
probably so you ran Prowler and you get

606
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:57,849
some checks like to make sure your

607
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:02,140
password is it has the different values

608
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,749
the length of the password and you have

609
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:07,269
to change the password every a number of

610
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:13,269
days etc and also last I don't know

611
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:16,449
about probably two weeks ago three weeks

612
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,209
ago I added an extra checks which is

613
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:23,109
beyond the CIS benchmark to check the

614
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:26,739
security of your three packets to make

615
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:29,349
sure that you have properly configure

616
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:30,729
your s3 packages you don't have your

617
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:34,269
litter box with a CA public or with

618
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:36,069
policies remember these three buckets

619
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:41,049
have a CL and policies both of them and

620
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:44,410
you may see in the ACL side that

621
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,979
everything is fine but a policy may have

622
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,859
your packet open so you have to look at

623
00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:53,829
both of them okay and the same for EBS

624
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:58,530
EBS volumes the beef developer we

625
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,490
has been medication sometimes he wants

626
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,530
to share what they have done with

627
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,590
someone else they just make it any BS

628
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,850
volume public they don't know or they

629
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,250
didn't figure out that they had keys or

630
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,950
called or many of different things at

631
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,290
this public so i am i added this check

632
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,470
to prowler just to make sure like I can

633
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,259
run pro rata gains one account all our

634
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:41,090
locations so you have to do to prevent

635
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,500
things happening in different regions

636
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,920
but also to prevent bad configurations

637
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,650
policies etc so this is a way the way we

638
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,370
did we do internally all this kind of

639
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:59,310
assessment at least ok so you can see

640
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,680
here if you have properly configured VP

641
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,490
CSV pcs also with the flow logs enable

642
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,890
etc just to make sure that you have the

643
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,550
basics regarding security in your in

644
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:23,000
your account ok this is what I have

645
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,140
takeaways so everything that they have

646
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,560
shown and templates and also the

647
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,730
presentations director cuts so so we the

648
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:39,570
presentation I had was too big and but

649
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:46,050
it's available also here I think that's

650
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,830
all yeah

651
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,140
remember to automate everything you can

652
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,370
automate everything because at the end

653
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,520
everything is an API call encrypt also

654
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,520
encryption everywhere any liar even if

655
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,910
it's inside a V PC and get everything on

656
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,810
print on transit everything enable a

657
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,360
consecration never use the same account

658
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,240
for everything use different accounts

659
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,010
not only for products

660
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,890
developing etc but also for different

661
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,680
groups or different work groups is much

662
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,900
better to use multiple accounts and AWS
