1
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,700
morning everyone I hope you all had your

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,739
khofifah and everything to caffeinate

3
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,960
you or get you through till the big

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,320
chick-fil-a comes so this is not meant

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,690
to be a very technical talk I want to

6
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,670
give a more broad approach that you can

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,250
take your both offensive and defensive

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,230
mindsets in order to take abstract

9
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,610
concepts and tie them in together

10
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,190
because I'm pretty sure almost everyone

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,769
in this room is IT information security

12
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:00,550
or some variant of it so quick first

13
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,010
show pens the Star Trek fans raise your

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,880
hands the Star Wars fans raise your

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,390
hands and neither of those fans raise

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,229
your hands why and here's my first

17
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,100
question why any want anyone care to

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,910
volunteer why neither of those two now

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,039
what if you can tie those two irrelevant

20
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,340
things to information security that's I

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,399
submit that to you something to do all

22
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,450
on throughout the presentations so the

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,270
first who I'm so my name is Tigran I'm a

24
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,189
senior analyst with Accenture federal

25
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,200
services I'm one of their cyber threat

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,830
hunters

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,229
prior to joining Accenture I worked in

28
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,020
the sock I did the physical FedRAMP diet

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,049
cap audits and I felt a little bit of my

30
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:55,600
soul died I did a little bit so I had to

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,689
escape for the most part I wasn't

32
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,369
originally IT like many people in this

33
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,159
room I was international relations for

34
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,240
the folks in world politics and

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,400
diplomacy and I made the jump through

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,709
there so it's a very atypical journey

37
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,549
but it did give me some good insight so

38
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,769
the classic disk of lemurs these are my

39
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,329
own opinions and they do not reflect

40
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,000
that of Accenture federal I also may be

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,500
slightly biased because I grew up

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,940
exposed in a multicultural environment

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,950
and I've traveled extensively with

44
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,630
family and I just had a habitual

45
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,060
curiosity of everything even the boring

46
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,130
things even the way to turn the boring

47
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,329
things into something that was more

48
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:36,070
fascinating for me so first we're going

49
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,379
to start by defining what is the rent a

50
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,780
Renaissance approach well a Renaissance

51
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,069
man

52
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,540
woman is a person who is well educated

53
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,180
and sophisticated and who has the talent

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,700
and knowledge in a variety of fields be

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,340
it they related or not related one grade

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,930
exempt two great examples would be linen

57
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,849
are da Vinci he was a scientist and

58
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,439
artist a musician inventor and writer

59
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,980
and Marie Curie who was a physically if

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,810
I'm wrong a physicist and a chemist I

61
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,519
was able to use both entertain

62
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,459
changeably a quote I found that's very

63
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,959
very helpful in this field is that one

64
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,669
should try to embrace all knowledge and

65
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,829
develop their own capacities as much as

66
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,299
they can doesn't necessarily have to be

67
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,120
expert or say but a deep enough

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
understanding that you can cross

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,829
correlate with other topics who

70
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,379
remembers this show hands from high

71
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,409
school or college the dreaded Persia

72
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,870
that our teachers would hammer into our

73
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,930
minds politics economics religion social

74
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,129
intellectual area or artistic and n is

75
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,609
the volunteer one for geography each one

76
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,199
of these we were told for our AP exams

77
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,780
to focus on them because they will be

78
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,449
tested on them but I found that applying

79
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,209
Persia to other outside academic

80
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,970
pursuits was very helpful especially in

81
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,419
this field who knows this guy raise of

82
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:17,430
hands and why is he formidable great and

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,988
how can you correlate this in

84
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,539
information security anyone

85
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,370
exactly and throngs and one of the

86
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,289
greatest things about thron is that he

87
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,030
emulated this philosophy that I felt

88
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,129
like that a lot of our red team should

89
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,099
look at because in essence it's not just

90
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,229
the tools because we're so tool centric

91
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,479
at times we forget that there's a whole

92
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,370
other mindset that comes with the red

93
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,539
team duty we have to become the bad guy

94
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,849
no we don't have to be cannot follow the

95
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,460
rules or else it defeats the purpose of

96
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,349
red teaming and his counterparts from

97
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,779
Star Trek he's knowledgeable in a

98
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,240
variety archaeology music philosophy

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,460
history and tactics and throughout all

100
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,159
of the fandom of the next generation

101
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,050
we've seen him use these variety of

102
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,870
disciplines help knowledge to navigate

103
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,650
through difficult circumstances

104
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:33,060
diplomatic or volatile so this is auric

105
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,370
got yesh the chairman of Bain & Company

106
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,219
who coined up the term expert generalist

107
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:41,129
I feel that the expert generalist is the

108
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,520
end-all product of following what I call

109
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,129
the Renaissance approach and Ori to find

110
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,050
the expert generalists as someone who

111
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,300
has the ability as well as the curiosity

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,279
to master collect expertise in variety

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,139
of disciplines they not necessarily have

114
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,659
to be connected in industry skills

115
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,870
capabilities countries and topics and

116
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,509
what this does it allows you to draw

117
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,370
deep on that pallet of knowledge and

118
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,009
create points that you can take and that

119
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,779
infuse that into a centered topic of

120
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,330
choice in this case information security

121
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,089
we can take things from English

122
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,750
psychology chemistry physics the entire

123
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,599
spectrum of subjects and then help use

124
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,229
that mindset in our own when dealing

125
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,680
with attackers or defense another thing

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,599
it does allows us to do is to drill deep

127
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,789
and perfect our thinking in information

128
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,550
security this concept is commonly known

129
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,129
as the t-shaped individual which I'll

130
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,370
get into a little bit later

131
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,919
these are some famous expert generalists

132
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,449
who applied the Renaissance approach

133
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,259
throughout their careers throughout

134
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,020
history as you see Warren Buffett Kathy

135
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Calvin da Vinci durin Isaac Newton

136
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,509
Auriga desh there are some others like

137
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,699
Ellen DeGeneres Oprah Winfrey a lot of

138
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,259
the celebrities were able to do the very

139
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,789
similar things as you can see in the

140
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,889
success of their branding and marketing

141
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:06,970
in addition to that what they were

142
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,530
primarily known for who knows charlie

143
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:23,710
munger show of hands who is he sir okay

144
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,050
and you notice how he's not talked about

145
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,000
much as always the focus is on Warren

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,699
Buffett but he embodies the

147
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,669
quintessential expert generalists he

148
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,470
studied in addition to his primary focus

149
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,789
of investing he studied psychology

150
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,270
chemistry physics English law

151
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,220
microeconomics and he tied them all

152
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,099
together to generate models for approach

153
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,430
for approaching different problems and I

154
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,560
feel that in the same way as to track

155
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,840
analysis can be used in information

156
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,639
security because it allows you to see

157
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,620
the world a little more accurate and

158
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,800
make better predictions of the future

159
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,510
because you're not as susceptible to the

160
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,630
biases of one area of focus as someone

161
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,520
would be who spent their entire focus in

162
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,320
one track for all their life

163
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,110
another thing is will allow you to do is

164
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,150
potentially have more breakthrough ideas

165
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,090
because you pull insights that already

166
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,979
work in one area into another that may

167
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:23,560
or may not work yet a third thing it

168
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,060
does is that it helps you build deeper

169
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,800
connections with people because some

170
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,370
cultures hold different values closer to

171
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,229
their heart as opposed to others and

172
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,760
being able to be cognizant an

173
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,010
understanding of that allows you to

174
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,299
garner a warm respect as well as

175
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,099
intimacy because if you meet someone for

176
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,920
example and you have one thing in common

177
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,279
okay that that's great but that's not

178
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,360
enough to establish more trust

179
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,470
friendliness with them now if there are

180
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,850
three or four things you have in common

181
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,329
albian they may not just be tied in with

182
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,470
information security but let's say you

183
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,410
like both like coffee tea or shrubberies

184
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,040
gardening or the Knights Hussaini okay

185
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,800
they get me that's the first thing you

186
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
get and they would be automatically

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,550
accepted into the tribe whatever it may

188
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,740
be so this is the the t-shaped

189
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,589
individual that already got yesh and

190
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,180
Charlie monitored the body very well

191
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,029
the mace stack would be in the middle of

192
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,920
the tea I would put information security

193
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,649
and below it I would start putting in

194
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,509
the pallets of what you learned from

195
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,370
different subjects however boring that

196
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,310
we may be there and then use it to feed

197
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,480
information security so in a way you use

198
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,449
all arbitrary and random tidbits of data

199
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,930
but reinforce it your role as a security

200
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:55,480
analyst some of the benefits as since

201
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,850
you said it gives you more options to

202
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,250
bluff and the ability as mentioned

203
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,930
before the ability to understand both

204
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,630
cultures Garner's a deeper respect from

205
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,209
a target towards a social engineer I

206
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,310
actually picked that up last year when I

207
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,670
was at DEFCON 24 there is a Japanese

208
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,470
national Toma he's a chicawa he was

209
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,779
giving a presentation on the cultural

210
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:19,509
impacts of social engineering and that's

211
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:20,980
one of the biggest insights I drew from

212
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,970
his presentation

213
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,400
whose foot who's familiar with the bet

214
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,030
the amro bank heist in 2007 anyone okay

215
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,850
so what happened was in 2007 a mystery

216
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,210
man

217
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,300
burgled safety safety deposit boxes at

218
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,790
the AMRO Bank in Belgium he stole

219
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,770
diamonds and other gems weighing at a

220
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,860
hundred twenty thousand carats and all

221
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,360
he visited the bank during his normal

222
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,840
hours and overcame all of the security

223
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,880
mechanisms and walked right out of the

224
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,420
door with about 21 million now 27 49

225
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,580
million with no tech tech vector at all

226
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,670
there were no hacks there are no flaws

227
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,890
but he used charm and the Renaissance

228
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,870
approach he got to know everyone he was

229
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,810
very well educated he spoke multiple

230
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,460
languages he brought chocolates for the

231
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,040
employees and getting garnered so much

232
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,290
trust that the employees gave him the

233
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,720
keys to the safety deposit boxes like

234
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,860
let's say they had to go to the bathroom

235
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,270
or they had to run an emergency errand

236
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,100
for their family gave him the keys so he

237
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,210
made copies of them and use that to pull

238
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:36,150
off his heist this should give a better

239
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,100
indication of how you can use these

240
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,810
random subjects if you're doing a social

241
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,240
engineering engagement if wonder if the

242
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
more limited your pie is the less

243
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,600
chances that your social engineering

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,270
engagement will work or it also in

245
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,570
converse it's less likely that someone

246
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,010
will be able to exploit you because if

247
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,300
you have a deeper knowledge and a

248
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
variety of topics and you know someone's

249
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,770
full of it you can call them out on it

250
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,060
that way or make a mental note saying

251
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,630
this person's not being truthful be able

252
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,610
to detect a little bit easier it's not a

253
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,260
foolproof method but it does increase

254
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,220
the percentages these are just a few

255
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,470
examples of the approach however wish

256
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,360
however way you want a pair it's up to

257
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,750
you

258
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,720
some complement each other and you can

259
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,060
thread different topics with individuals

260
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,100
but just remember when you connect with

261
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,020
someone on multiple levels it solidifies

262
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,910
trust authenticity

263
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,920
and emotions that you may have with them

264
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,750
because you get them you're

265
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,190
automatically accepted into their tribe

266
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,410
because you understand them on a myriad

267
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,790
of tiers these are some recommended

268
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,740
readings I have based on Persia I'll be

269
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,360
including this on my github for those

270
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,790
that are curious as well as diving into

271
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,180
deeper smaller sub topics for example in

272
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,700
information security as well as social

273
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,820
psychology and the like so this list

274
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,950
will be available on my github within

275
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,220
the week

276
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,230
there's some recommended podcasts I have

277
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,180
because all I know I know very well that

278
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,980
most people a lot of people do not like

279
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,330
to read and prefer the audiobook version

280
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,200
or just listening and this is for those

281
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,690
the audio files I highly recommend the

282
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,720
social engineer podcast and the art of

283
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,020
charm as well as the Tim fenris show

284
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,880
there's been some really good recordings

285
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,270
from them so to make a wrap up so the

286
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,860
Renaissance approach enables you to

287
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,320
essentially become a human nmf or expert

288
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,210
generalist you'll have more to discuss

289
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,750
with people contribute with them it also

290
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,540
eliminates the potential of saying that

291
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,460
they don't know much they don't know

292
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,080
what to talk about this gives you a

293
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,570
myriad of things to talk about and you

294
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,850
can also bridge cultural differences

295
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,770
which can be used in your favor if you

296
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,570
are on engagements because other

297
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,670
cultures have different values and

298
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,000
priorities as Thoma heesu eloquently put

299
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,070
it in his presentation and you can

300
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,870
create pretext on the spot when you feel

301
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,340
like you have nothing to say you can

302
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,780
just draw something random or make an

303
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,240
observation and use it that way just

304
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,230
remember use it for good

305
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,060
just like the force getting in touch

306
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,010
this is my Twitter github and email does

307
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,720
anyone have any questions per se I want

308
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,180
to make this as engaging as possible

309
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,180
because you might you might be wondering

310
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,190
why the arbitrariness of it all and I

311
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,750
would love to help put it

312
00:14:42,750 --> 00:15:02,400
for you yes ma'am okay certainly so one

313
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,710
example we would be the Russian actor

314
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,860
the Democratic of reach for example it

315
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,480
was determined that they were done by

316
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,470
two thread actor groups from Russia but

317
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,470
based on that let's look at the cultural

318
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,750
aspects of Russians throughout their

319
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,520
history they've been very persistent

320
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,700
they've been almost merciless to the

321
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,410
point that they don't take no for an

322
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,740
answer

323
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,060
they also like to leave artifacts behind

324
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,550
but in the mindset that they wanted you

325
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,080
to find that so just like the Russian

326
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,900
nesting dolls a month ryoga's they leave

327
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,030
use artifacts but that's because they

328
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,190
wanted you to find it as well

329
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,040
does that help see how you can tie in

330
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,200
certain aspects of their cultural as

331
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,770
well as the information security ma'am

332
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,450
okay so through other aspects the

333
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,400
cultural aspects will define and

334
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,530
upbringing helped define how people

335
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,980
usually act an example would be the

336
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,130
person who created the black POS from

337
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,810
the target breach and the Neiman Marcus

338
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,060
region it's a thirteen-year-old coder

339
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,880
raised in Russia he made this exploit

340
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,680
sold in the black market and the actual

341
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,540
people pulled off the heist bought it

342
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,240
but those people the people in Russia

343
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,160
grow up in a very very mathematics chess

344
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,050
influenced it's just a very very alert

345
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,240
interlock on the cultural approach they

346
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,500
learned their culture and then they

347
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,240
learned about other cultures and that

348
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,610
allows them to have edges on others that

349
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,769
let's say are more

350
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,259
tool centric as opposed to culturally

351
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:43,040
century because they anticipate what the

352
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,629
next step is going to be they're already

353
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,850
able to predict let's say this culture

354
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,069
is a stickler for rules we follow the

355
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,389
book and go this way

356
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,149
the Russians exploit that in that case

357
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:55,790
does that help further answer your

358
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:04,239
question ma'am China would be another

359
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,230
non-state actor it'd be a little

360
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,939
difficult for me to pull out a non-state

361
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,309
actor example per se I don't have one

362
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,500
readily but I am planning on getting a

363
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,179
little more in depth with more specifics

364
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,520
in my follow-up talk I meant this to be

365
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,220
as general as possible the next of the

366
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,659
series is going to be more specific

367
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:28,069
going to more of the case studies so I

368
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,990
could answer your question yes sir

369
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,870
that's the next question I'm vining

370
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,760
brought that up so the Defense Language

371
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,610
Institute has a certain section that's

372
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,159
open to the public is call it's a

373
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,960
specific country perspective they have

374
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
something called Russian perspective and

375
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,840
they touch on a lot of the things I

376
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,820
discuss on the cultural aspects the

377
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,559
geographic that basically they go down

378
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,260
through Persia in a very very detailed

379
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,559
way and for a jump start let's say you

380
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,789
haven't learned the language at all it

381
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:38,120
would be a great first resource I went

382
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,529
through I'm sorry it's for you no I'll

383
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,400
provide the link I might get up

384
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,990
anyone else I do have some prizes for

385
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,570
you guys so we'll start with the rubber

386
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,240
ducky anyone can answer who is the guy

387
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,220
from Star Wars I made reference to you

388
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:27,010
got it the package deal here we've got a

389
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,040
2.4 gigahertz and 5 bears dual band high

390
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,350
gain indoor panel antenna and a

391
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,080
long-range USB adapter this is the

392
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,090
question for you guys who is the guy

393
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,860
it's not I mentioned that is not well

394
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,930
referenced per se if all the attention

395
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,270
is on his partner but he seldom talked

396
00:19:46,270 --> 00:20:01,120
about and the last one for further for

397
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,920
white hair and graying in an early age

398
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,050
the blue team handbook instant response

399
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,090
Edition this question would be if

400
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,830
someone can explain to mean the the

401
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,400
t-shaped individual the diagram you got

402
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,520
it

403
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:30,930
[Applause]

404
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,550
for people of questionable intent a

405
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,430
lockpick set illegally exactly an

406
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,810
illegal to say Virginia just make a

407
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,520
letter saying I'm authorized there's

408
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,960
something along those lines before are

409
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,700
you wandering around with this but what

410
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,290
was the term I use to determine how the

411
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,940
Russians have hit their artifacts

412
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,490
through the Democratic dnc breach

413
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,750
[Applause]
