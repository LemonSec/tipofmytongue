00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,540
in this case I forgot to plug in my

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:54,150
every memory are that we bitter end

6
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,000
the - road is about 40% of response to

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:20,280
this answer do not have the true nature

[Music]

14
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,289
we'll share with you we learn everything

15
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,090
doing a bit of a sample set some of

16
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,710
those fascinating stuff that you can

17
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:35,479
pull from memory memory and user in the

18
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,610
speech in through trying to explain who

19
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,700
these are human thing to compromise the

20
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,800
system one finger is requires objective

21
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,250
but

22
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,790

[Music]

25
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:17,470
so these are examples of schools that

26
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,400
are being used in response to monetary

27
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,100
and wondered exactly in quest

28
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,090
when she does know

29
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,110
[Music]

30
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,389
we're going to start with the you guys

31
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,809
ready yeah there's a little bit of a

32
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:05,349
challenge

33
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,019

34
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,490
[Music]

35
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,490
okay

36
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:18,920
[Music]

37
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,499
[Music]

38
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,059

39
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,230

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,300
[Music]

43
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,260
we already run on your box to now point

44
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:41,230
back to something how users behind all

45
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,900
that seem close to either way from one

46
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,069
to ten - machine

47
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,959
join me in the box

48
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,749
[Applause]

49
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:13,980
[Music]

50
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,120
[Music]

51
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,689
[Music]

52
00:11:52,150 --> 00:12:03,240
[Music]

53
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,029
[Music]

54
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:53,040
yeah so the start time ridiculous

55
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,619
[Music]

56
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,820
[Music]

57
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:32,729
so if you want to clean up more ps3

58
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,309
[Music]

59
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,529
so maybe some techniques up here yes

60
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,429
tree increases parent-child presentation

61
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:09,110
of the process list so become unstuck

62
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,749
outs and sudden drill down and show

63
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,970
these three things you see me run

64
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,649
history in roseburg at TRADOC now we're

65
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:25,959
looking at conclusively wouldn't have an

66
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,089
expiation right we're gonna process it

67
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,149
was launched that rural location then

68
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,639
it's almost said hey Addison paradise

69
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,759
but hey there's a copy of minor London

70
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,100
every currently executing so we surely

71
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,139
do need to worry about it we know that

72
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,709
malware

73
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,589
[Music]

74
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:48,970
and so you get Parvati buys out of

75
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,890
memory which is another fascinating

76
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,380
thing to do I mean you probably have the

77
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,150
memory image without concluding my

78
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,330
reading the way in class notes when the

79
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,340
machine was running so that's what we've

80
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,130
done here and everybody said I found an

81
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,319
observatory Google directory which is

82
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,109
supposed to be there so this becomes

83
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,400
quite lovable

84
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,489
[Music]

85
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,000
right my report right now my

86
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,450
recommendations with us all the animals

87
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,470
represent that time on here that's nice

88
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,560
CSV then you go you see in light blue is

89
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,970
the one we're just looking at them to

90
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,190
the microscope the Google directory is

91
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,690
created if you go too much time that

92
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:46,490
passes between these really strange

93
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,940
backgrounds to loyalty card dot JPEG

94
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,120
will be carved up yet see what is that

95
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,790
we're starting to see a relationship is

96
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,640
problem just what you do to is beginning

97
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,180
context so I'm gonna have this prior to

98
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,400
that straight rule of her to be created

99
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,900
what did it uses you're answering

100
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,710
question

101
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,040
so another we correlated is data

102
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,800
bringing a little bit of the new of

103
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,120
execution that we're starting to see

104
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,180
more and more in forensics is shoot

105
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,730
actually these were entries their eyes

106
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,160
the system registry hive with the

107
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,819
[Music]

108
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,980
[Music]

109
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,739
[Music]

110
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:22,259
[Music]

111
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,240
right there in the middle of the so this

112
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,780
is the shim cache mem put and the

113
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,600
topmost entry is the most recent program

114
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,390
that executed as you start moving down

115
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,460
on the list here it becomes an older

116
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,580
entry so I think it is what entry number

117
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,310
six so you can see my arrow here

118
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,370
that's the rogue SVC hosts that I can't

119
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:13,040
get a modified time of this binary is

120
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,640
captured here and then of the 2010 last

121
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,350
modified time down here a little bit

122
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,860
further is a loyalty card exe so you

123
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,550
have a little bit

124
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,130
[Music]

125
00:20:30,500 --> 00:21:06,620
so to the story

and this one is the dark dark story and

130
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:18,249
all started with it still watches here

131
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:22,200
is that priests name them do that

132
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,489
watch your asses businesses this song

00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:28,690
supporting supporting roles played by

134
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,509
foreign cars but watch these certain

135
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:56,129
index obviously others on the left

136
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,950
but but somebody definitely not as well

137
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,630
we have our eternal IP address and if

138
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,750
that 148 if you can see it the second

139
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,090
red box 148 seems to have

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,080
the Blue Room you see there we have one

147
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,379
very easy to turn - bottle flutters so

148
00:24:52,379 --> 00:25:04,149
here we go las casas down there yeah the

149
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:07,509
luminosity of memory is not going to try

150
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,039
staring this is a real memory image of

151
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,559
our fighter so we got maybe you want to

152
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:24,029
know how long this machine started

153
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,559
[Music]

154
00:25:31,559 --> 00:26:04,010

we have entry number 19 and 20 anyone is

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,159
anyone identifying this nowhere yet

162
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,730
we're gonna end this SEC you can see the

163
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,580
that's just right

164
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,939
Augustine and then we have this task SP

165
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,900
1885 sharp locks okay next one next one

166
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,510
next one what do you do next how about

167
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,629
going deep this seven machine

it's women through the stuff you full

and to be different great about where

174
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,340
that would catch one at the bottom

175
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,070
that's not supposed to be running their

176
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,160
service so let's take this station

177
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,970
step-by-step style grace of extracting

178
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,030
recent efforts yeah you'll be fine on

179
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:23,889
this machine so thirty right

180
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:35,780
Who am I these are taxes included but

181
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:43,130
they each life into our business left

182
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,560
behind by mystery actual this is the

183
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,720
reality collection school leaving all

184
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,940
the school stuff but you might know this

185
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,610
closely mimics that which is perfect

186
00:29:52,610 --> 00:30:01,850
using the box - so you crazy

187
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,480
so these are backs to posting when it

188
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,000
turns out this is taking over the

189
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,730
critical all this stuff so I have to go

190
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,530
in and do some timeline analysis based

191
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:18,260
on our blessing as long as you know who

192
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,260
the true it is how about we go to the

193
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,370
entity analysis down to the last

194
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,260
completed out but still we got here I

195
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,770
sent this to a body class eyeball and

196
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:40,770
the parser isn't over

197
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,890
[Music]

198
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,260
it means beauty and speed then I'm

199
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,990
sharing with you yeah so we got more

200
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,040
time four-time MVP in that second home

201
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,230
that means the tile was right then that

202
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,110
you see blurred and then modified so

203
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,550
you're thinking they have something to

204
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,840
do with each other you'd be absolutely

205
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,570
right we take another look this is what

206
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,340
time liner another bullet

zero-waste 101 topic solid but now

218
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,918
that's pretty cool we lose all our

219
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,840
potential patient zeros now we find that

220
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,889

223
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,290
so one more machine to share with you

224
00:34:57,290 --> 00:36:15,530
but ok box number three this one this

225
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,369
one's a little personal

232
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,530
so we're not worthy

233
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,110
hey baby welcome to turn out the new

234
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,490
religion those religions from the ps3

235
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,190
technique this shirt on verbosity it was

236
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,940
shared earlier

237
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,850
why not same thing here very routine for

238
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,790
one classmate remember with all my

239
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,010
reason just me or if every single

okay our sewer where we travel inside

249
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,470
insanity artists and you see just with

250
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,570
his massive prahka lasa the scribbles

251
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,120
were covered in creation time so we put

252
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,180
this

253
00:42:15,170 --> 00:43:17,310
all right 24 files there was driving for

254
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,630
you have the time to that first engine

255
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,240
they show you three top trunk is reach

256
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,400
out for my spreadsheets you know this

257
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,680
person and true is the more time the

258
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,980
prefect so what is that quarter there's

259
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,090
one time which is creative or leagues

260
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,410
with first

261
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,140
at last 10 seconds

262
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,330
this is probably my powerpoint you know

263
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,300
I am I am running a Mac Soho it's sort

264
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,920
of like how were that's what it is power

265
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,080
and it's been a plague of mine does this

266
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,360
count as a demo fail can I say it can I

267
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,860
say it's been two years in a row now

268
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,450
damn now I owe you a demo I don't even

269
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:17,250
see where to plug this guy in nice all

270
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,160
right no who's in Oz as my machine comes

271
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:56,760
back up ooh that was super fast I mean

272
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,890
it has a bunch of signatures that are

273
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,740
looking for some very specific data to

274
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:12,150
include IP addresses in the same things

275
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,070
done so I would include that I don't

276
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,200
mean to only propose that you do

277
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,700
structure analysis on your memory images

278
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,750
no it's pissed it's like this is the

279
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,980
last time you're gonna rob me a power

280
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,720
like note to self the next person that's

281
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:46,589
coming up so you're not going to be the

282
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:49,319
witness it's super fast start up I guess

283
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,690
it is time for a new Mack

284
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,909
[Applause]

285
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,670
[Applause]

286
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:03,019
that's it mm-hmm

287
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:22,089
it's absolutely angry now not responding

288
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,519
this gives me a chance you can see it's

289
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:16,329
coming up cool

290
00:48:16,329 --> 00:49:02,410
yeah I think I'm gonna have to hold the

291
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:08,699
line for when straightening the one

292
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:47,200
[Music]

293
00:49:47,200 --> 00:50:18,140
total but that was in fact as well see

294
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,559
nature then again and forever clocks but

295
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,470
because infected way early like that was

296
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,029
released and spotted out there in the

297
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:29,059
wild on the 8th of October and I think

298
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,279
our infection was the seventh this

299
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:34,329
explains why

300
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,820
[Music]

301
00:50:51,040 --> 00:52:05,500
yeah so

302
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:16,090
[Music]

303
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,330
[Music]

304
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:27,700
by machines intended to protect the

305
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,328
environment from

306
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,809
I agree that up but he was trying to see

307
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:35,730
us with a lot of them these knocks man

308
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,579
usual that can meet any prints to start

309
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,020
different different routines

310
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,839
yeah yeah so even we're looking for a

311
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:49,490
foundation that points to detection

312
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,540
watching for the beginnings of these

313
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,829
routines and

314
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,920
[Applause]
