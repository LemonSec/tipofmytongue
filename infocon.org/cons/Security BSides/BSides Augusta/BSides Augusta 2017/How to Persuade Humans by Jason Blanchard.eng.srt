1
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,540
No yes the title of this is humans

2
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,309
getting your message across the people

3
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,530
my name is Jason Blanchard I'm a

4
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,239
professional social engineer means I

5
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,210
work in marketing my entire sole purpose

6
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,680
in life is get people to click links

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,330
just like any Nigerian prince and so

8
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,949
that's what I do on a daily basis so I

9
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,720
come from a marketing background from

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,610
college books and filmmaking and so I

11
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,740
don't necessarily know how you do what

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,990
you do but you may also not know how to

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,680
do what I do so I have some I'm gonna

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,390
try to explain here in the next 30

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,610
minutes as my Twitter handle if you want

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,810
to follow me on Twitter I don't really

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,820
tweet that much except when I'm going to

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,930
give a talk cool there's like a lot of

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,259
you right now

20
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,119
if you didn't notice I raised my hand -

21
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,600
so - before we really really begin I

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,060
want to let you know that I I am a

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,840
nervous shy person in real life I'm just

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,149
generally a side person when I'm on

25
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,159
stage and it's a little different when

26
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,210
I'm working in booths

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,399
I'm shaking hands as my job but in real

28
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,179
life I'm a pretty shy person I love and

29
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,600
hate presenting like before this

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,060
happened I was outside in the heat just

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,970
let the Sun cook on me I took ten deep

32
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,340
breaths before I came back in here and I

33
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,590
walked in house I can't students but I

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,360
love doing this because I get to teach

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,250
people something but I also hate doing

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,510
this because you're all looking at me

37
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,400
and so there's that love-hate

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,920
relationship that goes hand-in-hand I am

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,230
prone to anxiety attacks and panic

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,930
attacks I've had these before where I've

41
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,430
been presenting and all of a sudden I

42
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,200
realize you're all looking at me and

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,459
then I become incredibly self-aware and

44
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,959
I get like a thousand-yard stare the

45
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,549
worst time was I was presenting to the

46
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,799
CEO and vice president's and self of the

47
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,420
company I was in and out of saying

48
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,620
something they all had this look on

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,120
their face of like we don't believe you

50
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,880
and I feel like it took 20 minutes for

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,890
me to reach for the pose I'm sure it was

52
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,600
like 30 seconds no one even notice but

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,260
it was fine so it's internal you may not

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,450
even notice that I have like an anxiety

55
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,280
attack or you know anything here

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,380
today but the reason why I'm telling you

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,350
why all this happens is because I suffer

58
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,670
from self-doubt I'm the imposter

59
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,560
syndrome and all those things like you

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,270
may one day suffer if you're giving

61
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,569
presentations but I because I still get

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,819
up here and do this so I never want your

63
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,770
shyness for your is ID attacked or

64
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,300
anything that you think you may have

65
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,190
keep you from ever giving a presentation

66
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,440
and teaching somebody's son and

67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,940
especially when it comes to work and you

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,590
have something to offer in other people

69
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,450
please don't hold back because you think

70
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,060
you have these things it's a thing that

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,040
you just have to overcome and I've been

72
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,510
doing this for like 14 years and I was

73
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,500
telling these guys before we even

74
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,070
started I am nervous right now but 15

75
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,290
minutes from now I'll kind of feed into

76
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,780
it and then also don't be over into all

77
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,950
right that's fine okay I was born a

78
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,350
storyteller seven and my brother took me

79
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,630
to go see the movie Top Gun in the

80
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,440
theater age seven and I don't know if

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,780
you've ever seen the movie Top Gun maybe

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,459
you haven't maybe you have but I was

83
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,310
seven years old in the theater he's more

84
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,019
like stadium seats and everything like

85
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,390
you have now against it in the theater

86
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:26,840
it was seven years old and also like

87
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,250
some birds and then he played some

88
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,810
long-ago do that and he was just

89
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:43,220
watching this movie so awesome you

90
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,590
remember the volleyball scene yeah

91
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,990
and then he's killing McGillis and all

92
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,490
of a sudden like he you know something

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,340
bad happen and then like if you spoil

94
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,330
something

95
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,039
happens and I'm sitting there in theater

96
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:01,909
like and then he goes he could be

97
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,409
consoled by Kelly McGillis and my

98
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:05,629
brother realized that Lovins was

99
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:10,419
happening he's a government absolutely

100
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,530
it's just like I kept watching Top Gun

101
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,909
and then at the end like he finally

102
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,620
found the strength to get back in a

103
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,060
plane because he had lost it because of

104
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,370
a bet and he gets back in a plane he

105
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,750
chooses off the bad guys and when he

106
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,069
gets back home to the aircraft carrier

107
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,599
and he lands and all of a sudden

108
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,580
everybody runs over and they throw him

109
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,530
up on his shoulders and I don't know if

110
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,669
you remember the end but he's got the

111
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:49,460
thing in his hand probably seven years

112
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,310
old good awesome

113
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,710
I remember I went out and bought the my

114
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,690
own f-14s and all that Tomcats and I

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,029
bought the soundtrack my money

116
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,099
and I put in my fisher-price plate-like

117
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:06,770
tape that I played that song all the

118
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,979
time and I loved movies from that point

119
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,039
on I decided I want to make moves and so

120
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,729
I went to the army eventually I went to

121
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,440
the army and I became a combat cameraman

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,180
so I was a twenty five picture all along

123
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,940
time ago 96 of 2002 and so I was a

124
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,289
combat cameraman they taught me how to

125
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,759
be a video editor and I made a lot of I

126
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,259
don't want to call propaganda

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,160
but we had this rule that if if it was

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,410
1% true is true and the fact that we

129
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,669
filmed it means it happens

130
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,750
from the Army I went to Full Sail

131
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,370
University which is a Film School in

132
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,800
Orlando Florida from from there I began

133
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,860
began being a teacher at the school

134
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,180
because I had six years of experience

135
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,340
and so I came to teach now is a

136
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,740
nonlinear editing teacher and so I got

137
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,990
to teach people how anything affects how

138
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,210
human beings perceive information and so

139
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,520
by doing this over the years I started

140
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,259
to learn about storytelling and how

141
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,139
humans like yourselves like to watch

142
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,120
things and so what I'm gonna talk to you

143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,860
about now is how humans like to watch

144
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,629
things and learn things so that way you

145
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,729
can apply that to the way that you also

146
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,090
have a manage so all stories break down

147
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,969
into spide simple parts there's the hook

148
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,939
the beginning the middle climax and end

149
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,189
the hook beginning middle climax and end

150
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,159
the hook beginning middle those are the

151
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,729
five simple things a hook beginning and

152
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,610
ending and what I want you all to start

153
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,500
thinking about is that every time you

154
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,930
tell the story you do this there's a

155
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,520
look at the beginning there's the middle

156
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
there's a climax of Japan in every

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,509
single story you've ever told it's just

158
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,430
you may not have noticed it or you

159
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,469
weren't being intentional about it but

160
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,599
now that I'm explaining it to you when

161
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,979
you start hearing stories from now on

162
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,870
you'll start to hear the hook the

163
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,550
beginning the middle the climax an end

164
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,710
and when you started tell stories you'll

165
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,629
start to think in the hook beginning

166
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,430
middle of a climax event and if you

167
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,979
don't believe that you're a storyteller

168
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,699
and my next slide

169
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,250
I have a belief that most people drink

170
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,480
and do drugs so that way they have

171
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,860
stories to share the next time they

172
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,100
drink of your drunks there's so many

173
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,900
great stories that start off with hold

174
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,299
my beer I mean just think about how many

175
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,950
awesome things have happened after

176
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,270
someone said them but going from place

177
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,370
to place and talking to person to person

178
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,650
I remember back in the army that there

179
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,300
is people in the unit that were

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,850
phenomenal storytellers and it almost

181
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,010
always started with so back home right

182
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,070
and you knew a storm is coming and it's

183
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,950
gonna be great but there's this one time

184
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,080
did I ever tell you these are all books

185
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,070
oh I've got a story you remember last

186
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,130
time these are all books as soon as you

187
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,140
say these things the person you're

188
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,860
talking to like tell me more and we're

189
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,750
used to doing this we may just not have

190
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,750
known that we were doing this I'm gonna

191
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,550
right now ruin every 93.4% of movies for

192
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,500
you the reason why I had this exam

193
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,120
sayers did I made it up because I work

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:33,690
in marketing yes you put a point after a

195
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,529
percentage to you with this

196
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,250
automatically think it's real in any way

197
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,040
the hook on all movies and so we're

198
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,990
taught in screenwriting we're taught

199
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,380
moviemaking that by page 3 page 3 in the

200
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,779
script that you're writing page 3 is the

201
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,730
hook you introduced the main turn I page

202
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,770
3 and if you think back to any movie

203
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,750
I've ever seen

204
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,010
the main here in the first three minutes

205
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,750
of any movie that's why if you miss the

206
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,560
perfect

207
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,380
it kind of lost a little bit because

208
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,360
there was that cook there trying to get

209
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,130
your attention - then tell you the rest

210
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,630
of the story so it's in the first three

211
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,320
minutes by minute 10 minute 10 something

212
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,070
bad happens

213
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,470
a small bad thing now it's not a big bad

214
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,240
thing happens but a small bad thing

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,580
happens in the movie Top Gun it was

216
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,070
essentially you're going to Top Gun like

217
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,020
that was the wasn't a bad thing but it

218
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,810
was a next by minute 30 the hero goes on

219
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,529
a journey to fix something bad they're

220
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,630
going on if it's Frodo he's going to

221
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,680
return the brain if you think back to

222
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,420
the movies on the quest to do something

223
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,080
by minute 45 page 45 essentially meta 45

224
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,150
and also once I've talked to this you go

225
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,010
back and watch movies and you hit the

226
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,180
pause button as you're watching he was

227
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,740
right I was watching the movie and it

228
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:12,930
was literally like a minute 3 when I

229
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,110
film school the one thing is all people

230
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,490
who went to film school love making

231
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,440
movies by the 9th month in film school

232
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,110
they all hated moves because they knew

233
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,300
how they were made so 9 minute 45 the

234
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,220
hero's winning everything's going well

235
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,830
but by minute 60 falls levels something

236
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,930
bad happens the character lost the you

237
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,930
know something terribly happened to the

238
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,130
character and if you think back to all

239
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,780
the movies you you can think about right

240
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,670
now you know that this is true the

241
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,200
hero's winning then also the heroes

242
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,180
losing but then by minute 75 they either

243
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,640
a mentor where they've found the will

244
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,800
within themselves they found a magical

245
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,320
item worth of whatever they need to kill

246
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,020
the bag and by minute 75 you had the

247
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,460
climax of the movie and then that last

248
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,880
15 minutes or so if you were and then we

249
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,920
have a thing that finished the movie as

250
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,000
fast as possible

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
don't linger don't sit around don't talk

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,580
about you finish the movie soon to

253
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,550
climax it over your life and and if you

254
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,900
think back to your movies that you

255
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,690
really enjoyed it will be like whoa and

256
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,080
it's done die hard is a great example of

257
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,540
this guy hearted like non-stop action

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,650
and so now I have just ruined all movies

259
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,540
for you and I'm sorry because the thing

260
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,070
is when you go to watch a movie next

261
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,720
time it follows this formula if you've

262
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,560
ever sat there and go oh I hope he wins

263
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:52,040
really Wow so another editing so if

264
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,870
that's the story breakdown of movies

265
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,730
here's what happens to you and here's

266
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,680
what editors do to you on purpose

267
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,470
and once I've learned how this works it

268
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,660
was really fascinating and a powerful

269
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:08,180
tool for editors to use is three seconds

270
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,460
flow whenever you watch a movie a TV

271
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,480
show or anything

272
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,340
the average edit is three seconds long

273
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,380
or there's gonna be camera movement or

274
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,450
something happens but it's one one

275
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,440
thousand two and done three windows and

276
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,700
the reason why is because your brain

277
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,670
which is this amazing tool but your

278
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,560
brain still takes three seconds to go

279
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,700
what do I see I know what I see and it

280
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,740
relates it to something else and what

281
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,350
this looks like in your brain is you see

282
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,770
on the screen a yellow house and it

283
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,840
takes a second for your brain to go see

284
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,290
it it's yellow it's a house so that's

285
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,150
what happens in two seconds but in the

286
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,040
third second your brain goes there is a

287
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
yellow house like that my neighborhood

288
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,700
it relates it to something that's why

289
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,390
when we watch movies we cry every lap or

290
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,030
we get anxious because it's not about

291
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,860
what's happening to the

292
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,510
on the screen it's about what's happened

293
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,730
to us before and as we're watching it

294
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,140
we're leading it to something that

295
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,810
happened to us like the notebook like

296
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:19,089
when you're watching the note so you

297
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,130
were lead it into yourself but it takes

298
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,339
your brain 3 seconds do so at 4 seconds

299
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,690
here's what happens your brain so 4

300
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,480
second edit your brain says I see

301
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
something it's a yellow house there's a

302
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,920
yellow house like that my neighborhood

303
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,769
and then it makes one more leap and then

304
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,410
another second there was a pretty girl

305
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,649
that lived in that house - it starts

306
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,579
relating so that's I see a house it's a

307
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,380
yellow house there was like that my

308
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,290
neighborhood there is a pretty girl and

309
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,370
so your brain is making those

310
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,370
connections in five-second edits and so

311
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,140
that's one one thousand two one thousand

312
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,730
three one thousand four one thousand

313
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,190
five thousand your brain is so fast and

314
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,680
so efficient it goes I see something

315
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,260
it's a yellow house there's yellow house

316
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,730
like that in my neighborhood there was a

317
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,620
girl that lived there and now you're

318
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,600
thinking about her and now what's on the

319
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,959
stream you like and didn't know one time

320
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,430
and then you're like I wonder if she's

321
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,209
on Facebook like that your brain just

322
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,370
keeps making leaves that's why if

323
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,199
someone's ever boring within a few

324
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,310
seconds you're thinking about your

325
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,500
checkbook or this or that or it's a you

326
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,029
know something like oh I forgot that at

327
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,250
home like it takes five seconds - loser

328
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,110
on it

329
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,820
it only takes five seconds to lose your

330
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,829
organs if you're not entertaining if

331
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:40,000
you're not giving new information if

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,560
you're not going to something else it

333
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,480
takes five seconds - loser audience I

334
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,070
remember being a teacher that if my

335
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,350
system ever went down or something ever

336
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,510
did not work I would continue talking

337
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,680
while I fixed it

338
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,720
well it's amazing that I have to fix

339
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,370
this right now all of a sudden as soon

340
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,140
as I get this hook back up and it back

341
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,220
up thanks guys

342
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,890
because if I stopped talking to fix that

343
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,820
I knew that

344
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,950
during that time and tried to maintain

345
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,750
their audience their attention in the

346
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,670
entire time so that's five seconds you

347
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,610
see how fast it is to lose your honor

348
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,900
and that's why I add it to only sticking

349
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,520
that three-second range in two seconds

350
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,310
let's go to the other two seconds your

351
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,960
brain goes I see it's a yellow house but

352
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,490
you don't really have time to relate it

353
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,230
to anything else you just your brain is

354
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,420
making a connection at one second your

355
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,800
brain goes I think I see something

356
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,130
I figured of yello-ha like it's just

357
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,790
trying to search for what that is and so

358
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,840
if you do faster and what's that what's

359
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,210
that what's that what's that what's that

360
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,880
what's that what's that what's that

361
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,980
and so your brain is constantly trying

362
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,770
to make connections at half second it is

363
00:16:51,770 --> 00:17:02,150
your brains like and your brain is

364
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,630
constantly trying to make a connection

365
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,670
after connection and here's what's cool

366
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,640
that happens to your brain all that on

367
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,359
tricity

368
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,540
all that stuff happening up there your

369
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,310
brain starts to get a little overwhelmed

370
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,209
so it releases happy chemicals like

371
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,579
prepare for something and so it releases

372
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,470
chemicals into your brain and you get

373
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,170
happy and excited that's why movie

374
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,530
trailers are cut in this range because

375
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,609
[Music]

376
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,520
and that's why they do the breakdowns

377
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,460
afterwards and then in this shot because

378
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:50,240
you didn't see it but you get excited

379
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,350
that's why after you see a trailer

380
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh Dale I can't wait to see that movie

381
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,570
yeah they know so they're doing this

382
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,750
here's what I'm telling you about

383
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,480
because I just did this to you and I'm

384
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,720
doing it to you right now I'm speaking

385
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,610
at a certain cadence of birth I was

386
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:27,149
talking fast I am now talking slow

387
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,049
because I want you almost pain on each

388
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:42,570
world I can do this long but I won't

389
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,299
because I'll do is your attention but

390
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,190
when you're giving presentations think

391
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,809
about this when you want people to be

392
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,029
excited about something you speed up

393
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:54,100
your cadence when you want them to

394
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,039
really sit in and listen and lean

395
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
forward when you slow down your words

396
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,679
and that's how humans like to receive

397
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:10,480
information there's a is if I walk

398
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,700
through here one of the things about

399
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,769
being a presenter sometimes is that you

400
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,990
get to watch your audience and what I

401
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,000
love is that as I'm saying these words

402
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,759
to you right now you're taking it all in

403
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,860
and you're listening to it and I can see

404
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,700
on your faces it's getting meta cuz

405
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,049
you're like oh damn he's doing that

406
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,549
thing I wonder what he's doing to me now

407
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,730
well let's talk about me see the thing

408
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,100
is I talked about a yellow house and

409
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,750
when I talked about the yellow house I

410
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,460
can only imagine that none of you saw

411
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,400
that yellow helps because in your in

412
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,170
your mind you got the picture of your

413
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,540
own yellow house but if I talked about

414
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,160
and I showed you that yellow house then

415
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,300
you would have been seeing this the

416
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,070
whole time I left it up to your own

417
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,870
imaginations when you're giving

418
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,210
presentations at times you can do this

419
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,520
you can leave it up to the imaginations

420
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
of your audience to fill in the gaps and

421
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,200
that works for certain presentations

422
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,110
because you want people to go and just

423
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,880
make up their own story and you'll

424
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,040
always make up a better story than I can

425
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,750
because that's the way you bring toward

426
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,060
it it's related to you and it's more

427
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,780
important to you so it's cool but then

428
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,660
there's the flip side of that and so I

429
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,020
used to project would work with

430
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,370
first-time directors and you know

431
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,200
students and things like this and there

432
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,880
was a thing that this is this is what a

433
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,170
film script looks like if you've never

434
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,950
seen one this would look like the big

435
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,370
interior and baited my day a bear ball

436
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,160
shines from a reflector atop a slender

437
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,680
stand a bubble I comment rising into

438
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,320
frame and flipping the light and extra

439
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,300
not like figure and a hazmat suit

440
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,150
reaches down to is what a script looks

441
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,470
like and this is what screenwriters

442
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,660
write and when I would work with

443
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,910
first-time filmmakers and people like

444
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,130
that and now I'd ask them what does the

445
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,970
abandoned mine look like and this ah

446
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,250
it's this really cool thing it looks

447
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,460
like a skull it's like this cool cave

448
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,370
and you see the entrance of it and I'm

449
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,280
thinking that's not in the script but

450
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,420
that's what the filmmakers saw in their

451
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,610
minds that's what they wanted to see on

452
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,640
the screen it was a bare bulb look like

453
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,790
I think this old school

454
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,740
bulb and you can see the filaments on

455
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,780
the inside like that's also not in the

456
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,830
script but that's and so what happens is

457
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,200
you when you're telling your audience

458
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,340
something you're like we need to buy

459
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,290
this we need to buy a server okay

460
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,690
they're figuring out in their heads what

461
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,030
that is they're filling in the planes

462
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,070
when you're not explicit they're gonna

463
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,810
fill in the blanks with whatever they

464
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,910
want to fill it in with because that's

465
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,710
how they perceive information if you

466
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,590
want people to know exactly what you're

467
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,480
trying to say you include attachments

468
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,030
the light bulb looks like that in the

469
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,770
helmet looks like this at that point

470
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,620
you've just killed all ability of anyone

471
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,870
to fill in the gaps themselves and I

472
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,510
would just think about maybe

473
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,740
presentations you give it in the past or

474
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,780
emails you sent or something where you

475
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,540
were vague but you didn't think you were

476
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,000
bad because it will all up here for you

477
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,040
but the person who got it they just

478
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,570
still know the gaps with whatever they

479
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,520
wanted to fill it in with and so when

480
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,340
you need to be specific be specific but

481
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,870
when you want to leave it to someone

482
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,210
else's imagination no one to do that as

483
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,340
well

484
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,350
so how do you apply how do you find the

485
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,260
words I have to write emails that's a

486
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,580
part of my job and sometimes I don't

487
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,710
know where to start I hate the blank

488
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,950
page

489
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,330
so what I do with a blank page to help

490
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,220
myself is I write in the works

491
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,960
hook beginning middle climax end I just

492
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,790
write those and then I fill in the

493
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,640
blanks because at least my putting hook

494
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,140
beginning no finite commands I start

495
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,660
thinking in that framework at ago well

496
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,590
the hook is the hook is the whole thing

497
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,620
crashed the whole thing went down that's

498
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,180
a good hook don't you think that's a

499
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,310
good like you're sending a plane crash I

500
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:45,020
would want to keep breathing the

501
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,990
beginning I went on I went on a quest I

502
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,640
went on a quest and in my quest I gotta

503
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,010
work it is that it crashed worse and the

504
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,930
whole thing fell apart remember the the

505
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,450
story arc of that something bad happened

506
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,610
to heroes fixes everything looks like

507
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,960
it's going well and then it gets even

508
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,940
worse and then there's a climactic part

509
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,640
and then you end it so the climax is to

510
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,580
fix it I have three solutions and you

511
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,410
can put the attachments in the emails

512
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,920
you can put specific solutions so that

513
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,820
way they don't have to fill in the

514
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,890
blanks themselves they can look at in

515
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,350
government got it those are my three

516
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,020
specific solutions and then they need to

517
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,750
end it very quickly so you have all this

518
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,280
and this is why you can't have nice

519
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,340
things

520
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,230
but when you're sitting there thinking

521
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,820
about how do I get my message across

522
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,680
I like I've talked to people who write

523
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
pen test reports and they're just really

524
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,030
mean but in your pen test report think

525
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,680
about it as a hook beginning middle the

526
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,260
flam accent end and that climactic part

527
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,110
we'll talk about that next when you're

528
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,780
giving a presentation so I'm giving a

529
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,030
presentation right now in this classroom

530
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,070
when it was time for me to write this

531
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,320
presentation I sat down and I had a

532
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,790
blank sheet of paper and I wrote the

533
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,790
words hook beginning middle climax and

534
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,040
end when you give a presentation I want

535
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,590
you to always do this when you give a

536
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,570
presentation started off by asking the

537
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,300
question so every presentation all if

538
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,620
you ever give your life by asking a

539
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,420
question of the audience a hypothetical

540
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,210
question not so they can answer it's

541
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,910
necessarily not significant throughout

542
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,250
these but I always like the race the

543
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,960
hand kind of question and the reason why

544
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,580
I like to raise the hand question is

545
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,880
because all of you walked in here at

546
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,070
11:15 with your own thoughts and agenda

547
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,110
and everything else going on and and you

548
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,430
are like not sure what I was going to

549
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,600
talk about but you're sitting there

550
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,490
you're talking you were thinking about

551
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,080
the last talk that you're in and I need

552
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,590
you to stop all that and pay attention

553
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,540
to what I was about to say and so I

554
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,100
started also the question and then

555
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,750
stopped anything else you were thinking

556
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,310
about and you started thinking about the

557
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,170
thing I want to do think about are you

558
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,220
shot to start off your presentation

559
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,560
given context history make a personal

560
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,360
people want to know why did you even

561
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,710
care enough to put this presentation

562
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,610
together

563
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,880
give me the context make it personal why

564
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,130
did you think this would be important

565
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,140
for the audience in the middle give it a

566
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,810
deep dive the conclusions the

567
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,670
observations that you come to you've

568
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,470
liked and I've learned this and I

569
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,660
learned that and I thought this was cool

570
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,760
as you gone through your presentation

571
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,190
you're giving that deep dive what you

572
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,530
learned what you experienced in the

573
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,910
climax how this applies to the audience

574
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,290
I've said through presentations before

575
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,590
where I got done another what

576
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,039
I just heard someone talk about what

577
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,749
they found for like 30 minutes

578
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:57,480
great thank you but how do them flags in

579
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,249
the audience how can they use the thing

580
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,169
that you've learned so that they can

581
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:03,929
apply in their letters in conclusion I

582
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,289
love I am a huge fan of when you're

583
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:08,909
giving a presentation that you end it

584
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:11,009
with the words in conclusion or you you

585
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,419
get ready to end it with in conclusion

586
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,070
and the reason why is because no one's

587
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,580
been paying attention at all they will

588
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,730
at this point because if you're like oh

589
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,159
thank god and they will hear the next

590
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,720
minute or so what you're about to say

591
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,240
and so that's your opportunity for the

592
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,999
too long didn't read part we sum up

593
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,830
everything maybe you give it like a

594
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,659
little inspiration towards the end so

595
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,889
that way they leave with that good

596
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,419
feeling because most people will never

597
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,070
remember what you say but how you made

598
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,710
them feel those kind of things and so

599
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,769
that very important in conclusion and

600
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,480
then if you're giving a presentation

601
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,789
that's something like this always say

602
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:55,830
thank you and tell people where they can

603
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,230
ask you questions afterwards because a

604
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,789
lot of times you won't come and Russia

605
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:01,830
at the end of the like hey I had this or

606
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,600
this or how can I apply this like that

607
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,119
so I always let people know where the to

608
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,519
meet me and that's where questions are

609
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,169
you know perfect and we'll talk there

610
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,129
and stuff like that

611
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:21,840
so in conclusion talk about storytelling

612
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,279
is just about the hook

613
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,950
beginning middle climax and end I want

614
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,860
you guys to become more intentional

615
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,929
about the way you tell stories I want

616
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:32,789
you to think about how the hook is

617
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:35,009
presented the middle the climax the end

618
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,600
I want you to think about that when

619
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,009
you're writing your emails or giving a

620
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,799
presentation we're just expressing a

621
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,789
message to anyone and I want you to know

622
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,059
that you know like life like here like

623
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,509
at work you know we're all artists or

624
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,910
you know we're always telling stories

625
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,560
something that happened we're in the

626
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,560
midst of a new story but stories are

627
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,110
awesome I love stories I I love sharing

628
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,000
stories with people because the stories

629
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,560
always remind me of that I'm alive and

630
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,420
stories remind me that I'm live because

631
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,190
I'm in someone else's story or they're

632
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,010
in my story and I think that's cool and

633
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,150
I think that's why humans have been

634
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,130
telling stories ever since humans could

635
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,680
talk I'm available for questions at the

636
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,500
sans booth that's where I went day job

637
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,540
is put on the other t-shirt and go back

638
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,360
to work then I will be giving away

639
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,550
t-shirts after lunch I hope that you

640
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,050
play cyber City which is on the third

641
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,750
floor upstairs I am you this one last

642
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,310
takeaway if you are interested in

643
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,660
anything that I've said today about

644
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,430
editing or about how humans perceive

645
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,950
information read in the blink of an eye

646
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,840
by Walter Murch this is guy who's been

647
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,400
editing films since they actually had to

648
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,890
cut the film and splice it together and

649
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,420
those are some of the films that have

650
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,000
gone on to win Academy Awards because

651
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,620
he's phenomenal what he does and you
