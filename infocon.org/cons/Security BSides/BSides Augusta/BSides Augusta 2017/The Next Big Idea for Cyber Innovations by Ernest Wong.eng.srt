1
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,390
very happy to be here besides Augusta my

2
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,120
clock is mostly about cyber innovations

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,059
or innovations in general very quick

4
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,920
pulling of the audience I actually like

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,390
to just get to know my is where I can do

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,850
these thoughts folks you are cyber

7
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,230
professionals cyber security

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,720
professionals any hackers in silence

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,199
okay yeah okay I didn't see as many died

10
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,720
ere this conversation to me that's the

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,280
indicator of I'm more of a hacker

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,009
conference or more well what about first

13
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,210
time attendees first time first time

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,270
these days yeah great yeah I know again

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,539
we have KITT all right sänger tenants

16
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:18,600
right now intense from Bullock out of

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,720
Fort Worden it's great high school I

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,080
mean high school elementary school

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,390
middle school explain any other yeah

20
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,200
okay great

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,250
that is hopefully this presentation

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,989
doesn't blow your mind too much way cuz

23
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:36,720
I I geared this presentation for second

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,399
graders and I found that this

25
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,140
presentation weren't better for second

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,759
graders and I didn't originally and

27
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,560
might know castles made verify this

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,119
you're gonna be my kid because he

29
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,830
actually moderated the first time I

30
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,349
presented the very first version of this

31
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,910
talk that was for 15 minutes that was a

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,929
very hasty presentation personally I

33
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,360
actually think this this room is the

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,239
best room of all the tracks right this

35
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,479
is the whisper and mother room right

36
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,110
sneakers I know I know I know someone

37
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,690
who's not seeing speakers so this is

38
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,310
finished first majors I tell all the

39
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,750
content I teach at West Point I teach

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,610
this image sharing I'm giving them all

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,819
silent project so I not 5 ft 8 and what

42
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,920
fun don't give us today's so meet you

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,010
for free we get paid grade so we know

44
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,090
how many TAS that's what I do

45
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,920
that's now to work them all my side

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,560
projects then I'll bring back up a

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,420
little bit later but on the four movies

48
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,860
I tell a woman like it has to watch

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,560
sneakers the one war games as the other

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,980
so you've already seen war games real

51
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,590
genius and matrix you've seen the matrix

52
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,150
as well so real genius and stingers

53
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,800
that's yes your homework assignment I

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,540
said you're taking my class that's your

55
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,709
homework sighs don't worry eight I just

56
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,470
watch the movies you'll see why very

57
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,930
quickly I work at this organization

58
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,060
called the army cyber Institute we're

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,650
located at West Point New York I told

60
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,420
you I was an instructor there professor

61
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,340
and IQ system you doing

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,400
but this break a quick video from the

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
scene yet they did a nice job talking

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,060
about you'll need exit out of here and

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,140
then close that one out so you can see

66
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,640
the video yeah it's complete that here

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,730
we go so seeing it there's this really

68
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,190
nice video you call it propaganda if you

69
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,620
want but they actually doesn't nice

70
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,030
jumps throw and half explaining right

71
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,870
everyone ask me what

72
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:55,860
seeking just volume as well I think I

73
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,900
might have just as my volume of mine as

74
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,070
well okay yeah there we go here we go

75
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,620
yeah there we go feel the quality

76
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,170
control my equipment government

77
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,580
equipments what it is I'm planing on the

78
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,310
government all right let's see if this

79
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:27,750
works third time what is the future of

80
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,600
cyberattacks and what's the military

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:39,480
doing about it we visited West Portland

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,460
the Army's prestigious 200 year old

83
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,710
military academy to watch the annual

84
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,520
cyber defense exercise dubbed at CES a

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
yearly competition among service

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,810
academies to see which teams can protect

87
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,660
their servers from NSA hackers people

88
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,610
are starting to realize them we built

89
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,900
all these things that were not relying

90
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,669
on but we sort of built it out in front

91
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,169
of the idea of security and so things

92
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,060
are kind of getting away from us and now

93
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm going to take some time to kind of

94
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,120
wrap in an iconic figure in a man who is

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,490
really complex cool there you go the

96
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,169
West Point team spending months creating

97
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,450
a server they could handle email file

98
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,850
transfers and other services for

99
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,940
thousands of simulated users for several

100
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,890
days the group of two dozen cadets

101
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,260
huddle together in a computer lab to

102
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,240
guard their systems begin to exploits

103
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,950
from the NSA

104
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,790
so the kids are part of an

105
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,200
extracurricular activity it's not a

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,390
client's evolving new things and being

107
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,680
able to protect something that's so

108
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,500
important in our everyday life and stuff

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,990
virtual a scoreboard was projected in

110
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,210
the front showing how well our meat was

111
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,520
faring against competing teams with

112
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,530
grades based on how well each link

113
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,350
maintains its network naturally the our

114
00:05:47,350 --> 00:06:11,740
team activities on this year though it's

115
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,440
really our efforts to predict post often

116
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,320
ways the country goes back a concept

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,600
called threat casting now that internet

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
connections are just about everywhere

119
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,130
with threat casters you're trying to put

120
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,860
yourself into what the attack surface

121
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,620
would look like that's my boss because

122
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,480
we know the attack surface is going to

123
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
be huge

124
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,390
he went on to describe a series of

125
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,940
potential cyber threats we may face in

126
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,520
the future such as a personal care robot

127
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,979
being act and harming its owner and we

128
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,030
already know about that right saw a

129
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,800
couple of additional mass traffic

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,260
disaster pulse think tank is also

131
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,300
considering the potential of some pretty

132
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,030
sci-fi concepts like augmented soldiers

133
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,200
and autonomous drugs we've been doing is

134
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,260
trying to figure out how the army will

135
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,240
bring cyber insider effects to the

136
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,420
bathroom

137
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,430
I don't know if it's terrifying or

138
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,500
comforting that high-level army

139
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,180
officials are thinking about robot

140
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,930
attacks and Bionic soldiers ensure cyber

141
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,060
attacks may worsen but efforts like

142
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,250
these should help the military prepare a

143
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,210
little more for what's coming

144
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,330
[Music]

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,080
there's supposed to be a part 2 coming

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,030
out in the next month or so

147
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,820
so I get to go this link or just go to

148
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,800
Yahoo and do it do a see next search for

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,380
a West Point sci-fi army should pop up

150
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,880
but really what I'm talking about here

151
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,440
today is just fall really thinking about

152
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,200
innovation and really I think innovation

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,970
you read the abstract in the book is

154
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,940
disagree I think innovation is really

155
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:55,790
driving really are us invent really talk

156
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,480
about it

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,060
how many folks actually study we

158
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,290
actually know how to make better

159
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,180
innovations that's what I'll talk about

160
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,520
here I don't think of innovations as a

161
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,130
monolithic entity I break it down I

162
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,620
break it down into two four quadrants

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,610
any business majors in the audience this

164
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,890
is yes so your business manager you know

165
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,170
you can break up any right you break it

166
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,700
off the world in four plugins and that's

167
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,960
what I've done

168
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,510
so let's hug it out baseline two

169
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,120
criteria what is the level of complexity

170
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,390
or a sophistication with the technology

171
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,520
the other is a target market or what

172
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,289
users want to use right whether it's new

173
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,289
user or existing users and we're on this

174
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,890
lower left-hand quadrant what I call

175
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,650
that right low complexity but existing

176
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,320
users I'm calling on sustaining types of

177
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,670
innovation okay on the high side well

178
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,990
think if I compress see I'm commissioner

179
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,550
I think what about heist like new

180
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,440
markets new new users

181
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,770
I call that breakthrough that's why a

182
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,610
little who's my Air Force yeah there we

183
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:08,970
go

184
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,560
therefore it's done that really well I'm

185
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,140
going to show you going full later but

186
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm actually focusing on this one went

187
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,090
quadrant right here right when it's low

188
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,380
technological complexity but very simple

189
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,430
things but new users I'm calling that

190
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,390
revolutionary innovation right I

191
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,160
actually want to think of revolutions

192
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,110
that's the analogy on these right

193
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,720
revolution in warfare there are a couple

194
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,670
hard business professors that coined

195
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,290
this term and disruptive innovations

196
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,430
that's why we need it

197
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,750
why can't you like revolutionary

198
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,580
disruptive innovations are things that

199
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,220
are low tech but target new users okay

200
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,170
so where's this mate right so I'm gonna

201
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,360
help hopefully try to explain what each

202
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,270
of these quadrants are in a more

203
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,960
simplistic manner when I think of right

204
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,600
this notion of breakthrough or really

205
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,460
client app innovation a lot of folks

206
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,990
think that's the only types of

207
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,910
innovation they're out there I can

208
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,740
guarantee some folks in this room think

209
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,440
that way especially like 9-3 try the

210
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,360
folks outside the vendors they probably

211
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,920
think innovation can only come from

212
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,280
hi-tech I'm very expensive warranty okay

213
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,670
but I'm gonna argue with that I think

214
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,800
right unfortunately that's the portion

215
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
apart right that's the way a lot of

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,020
people think about us

217
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm gonna argue right and unfortunately

218
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,960
right in the military right in the

219
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,750
military longer leaders only think that

220
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,460
when we breakthrough innovation right I

221
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,840
took in Air Force does that really well

222
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,300
the breakthrough stuff that's the only

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,310
type of innovation that exists I'm going

224
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,660
to try economist with this with this

225
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,250
presentation here I'm thinking

226
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,750
revolutionary sustaining innovation

227
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,090
they're just as powerful okay we're

228
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,230
going to power our nation against cyber

229
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,240
threats

230
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,520
how am i thinking about this so game I'm

231
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,110
not gonna introduce myself on my slides

232
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,150
I'm new to myself as this Lanesville one

233
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm a military intelligence officer so I

234
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,630
think generally in terms of threats

235
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,270
that's what the twos do right the a to

236
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,100
the N twos the s to s G

237
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,680
when I think of sustaining innovation is

238
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,540
the one character that comes immediately

239
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,830
to my mind is Spock right star trek fans

240
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,430
yeah good spot right he's very logical

241
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,590
he's gonna give Captain Kirk the courses

242
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,630
of action that had the highest probably

243
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,630
of success right even it means in

244
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,280
women's that's right sacrificing himself

245
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,730
right that was Star Trek to sacrifice

246
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,440
himself evolutionary innovation any

247
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,690
remembers fly boys to spy that's what

248
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm thinking of evolutionary right the

249
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,160
black sky is trying to kill the white

250
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,500
spy and every episode of rank one wins

251
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,960
or another just by doing something that

252
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,750
upwards the other spy what about

253
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,510
breakthrough high-tech stuff my fix in

254
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,240
the Air Force but right from the movies

255
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,740
the character that comes immediately to

256
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,890
my mind is James Bond James Bond gets

257
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,470
all the high-tech gizmos filming for

258
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,300
masters division other than my sense

259
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,430
they have resources all Great Britain to

260
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,710
give all these cool points and I don't

261
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,210
think Vickie pierce brosnan right I'm

262
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,670
thinking Pierce Brosnan the he's

263
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,520
controlling the end of you he's got the

264
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,070
watch that cuts through whatever it is

265
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,560
that means to save the day he's gone

266
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,960
behind that points

267
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,160
what about revolutionary innovations

268
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,620
does that even exist revolutionary

269
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,360
innovation we have any characters that

270
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,990
come to mind for me now I know I'm

271
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,950
dating myself here

272
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,710
MacGyver right what is he now yes we're

273
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,490
salami knife

274
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,560
yeah the dummy was actually gonna use

275
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,630
chewing right that's some paper with the

276
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,050
white carries in his pocket but right he

277
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,730
gots that pencil that graphite Linda

278
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,560
uses right whoever that is disposable

279
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,380
now I know that we have seen

280
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,270
don't die deliver now they have their

281
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,370
happy make of it I actually have seen it

282
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,790
I saw one half enough so I saw word hold

283
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:08,060
on okay that's good I closed up by an

284
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,590
oldie I'd say you think yeah that's not

285
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,110
good so if you don't know the guy you

286
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,910
don't want to want you to remake I know

287
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,710
you've seen this right you've seen Jason

288
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,220
Bourne

289
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,220
so Jason Bourne is disruptive and he's

290
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,810
revolutionary he's using whatever tools

291
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,140
are disposal to save his own life Lord

292
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,990
his friend's life

293
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,870
now one of these characters really

294
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,670
doesn't belong here right told you I'm

295
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,470
an Emily officer military intelligence

296
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,290
threat I'm huge Star Trek fan really

297
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,410
spot doesn't belong here so sorry spot

298
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,620
on that I send you away now the

299
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,850
character I'm thinking is mission

300
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,180
impossible I'm not thinking I am not

301
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:54,130
thinking is breakthrough he's going I

302
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,870
think that was from rogue nation where

303
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,930
he's playing a five-pound bag club

304
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,729
playing spider-man of course it's cool

305
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,100
but I'm thinking for instead of Spock

306
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,090
for sustaining I am thinking mission

307
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,470
impossible at the television series

308
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,370
remembers Leonard Nimoy played Paris in

309
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,770
Mission Impossible right he spoke like

310
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,450
10 different languages it was just a

311
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,130
variation of English just smoking

312
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,030
different dialects

313
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,650
I remember watching when I was actually

314
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,540
playing Japanese ambassador so he was

315
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,370
portraying a Japanese accent it sounded

316
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,350
very funny to me I'm Chinese but it's

317
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,010
not me but I think was for the benefit

318
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,500
of the audience understand well but

319
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,140
really the entire my Mission Possible

320
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,120
forces their sustaining right you

321
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,010
remember the Peter Phelps character he's

322
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,480
picking the best human assets he can to

323
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,250
calm these government's out of their

324
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,339
secrets or doing bad things we might

325
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,750
need that for North Korea but again

326
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,870
going to me Tom Cruise man that sort of

327
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,900
means I'm Tom Cruise

328
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,480
any topics fans in here know Tom Cruise

329
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,180
bands no one went no one saw Jason this

330
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,779
presentation on on presentations human

331
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,420
human persuasion yeah I saw his

332
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,610
presentation had changed mine so the 15

333
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,970
minutes I had I had concluded right

334
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,440
revolutionaries Tom Cruise getting hot

335
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,830
God right so if you if your big fat Top

336
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,130
Gun now I can't sing as well as Jason so

337
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:42,420
I have to use this so if you haven't

338
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,410
seen Top Gun well I have a different

339
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,210
take on it slightly different taping

340
00:15:48,210 --> 00:16:02,430
with Jason yeah well I'm sure glad sound

341
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,410
is working in here buying all the other

342
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,959
I need a pipe that sound over the next

343
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,020
Billy's of man coming over the phone

344
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,900
alright so if you can read this right

345
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,410
amazing bring this down let me see if I

346
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:35,040
can bring that down so you read this on

347
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,980
March 3rd 1969 the US Navy established

348
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,850
this program called Top Gun in the

349
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,020
Vietnam War the US pilots both Air Force

350
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,700
and a name which suffers some academies

351
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,880
been about a thousand have disappeared

352
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,150
that he's claimed to be shot down from

353
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,920
1965 9 16 that they suspended air

354
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,140
operatives for we're Department of

355
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,640
Defense said we can't sustain this right

356
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,589
the Russians just a Sony so I mean we'll

357
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,180
probably so many more aircraft we

358
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,040
couldn't sustain that war need a fight

359
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,929
with them so the department suspended

360
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,089
all air operations

361
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,128
no more bombings some more dock lights

362
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:14,429
in the air what the Navy did right what

363
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,378
the Navy did was they created Top Gun

364
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,720
you creep this right down to San Diego

365
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,169
Miramar you create this school so man

366
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,659
fighting right your silence our planet

367
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,559
is tactics of the Russian MIG 21s then B

368
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,840
1735 they were doing pretty good to read

369
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,019
a 110 calories right for every one Polly

370
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,299
we should sent the spies we shut down

371
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,490
three Russian pilots but that was not

372
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,139
good enough the Russians just had so

373
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,620
much more

374
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,929
what's the Air Force always like right

375
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,759
we need better weapon systems range

376
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,149
systems on our f4 and we need to build

377
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,909
bigger plus so the air force wing

378
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,679
technology high-tech low-tech

379
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,159
revolutionary interesting thing here

380
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:09,960
there's a book I had I gave me a

381
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,820
citation up to my cadets I can't

382
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,200
remember what the name of it but you

383
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,820
actually Google this right Google Top

384
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,408
Gun real Top Gun not the movie

385
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,039
amazing outcomes for the Air Force right

386
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,629
when they got their new f4 phantoms

387
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:28,049
upgraded their kill ratio state about

388
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:46,649
3:1 Navy the Navy pilots who went

389
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:49,590
through Top Gun and actually that spread

390
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,389
from the wind was about 8 to 10 week

391
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,580
course so again not every pilot went

392
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,039
through it but do you know what the

393
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,759
stats work for the Navy pilots 3 2 1 was

394
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,830
original stat right this shut up 1969 17

395
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,259
Russian kills four wannabe maybe problem

396
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,080
huge difference right that's right now

397
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,789
you don't need to be a mathematician the

398
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,919
lastest history so this right where the

399
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,909
three two one two 1701 just by doing

400
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:18,429
disruptive

401
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,279
Meishan okay that's my take on Top Gun

402
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,619
so the alternate talk a title of his

403
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:25,119
talk was and what I learned about

404
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,669
innovation from watching Top Gun but the

405
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,139
b-sides folks didn't like that so I

406
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,379
stuck with my original title let's see

407
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,690
again this is not from a mathematicians

408
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,610
perspective right this whole notion of

409
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,830
even carve out the world it's for

410
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,350
plugins yeah I kind of like more numbers

411
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,559
right I like numbers do I tell my crew

412
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,649
what is this researching where are the

413
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,869
numbers okay so a still not for

414
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:54,639
mathematicians perspective but if I add

415
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,389
one more quadrant right or one more

416
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:00,249
access to my boss complexity and then

417
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:03,039
target market target users and you know

418
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,110
awesome potential how can this

419
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,419
innovation drastically alter the

420
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,429
environment well what are those

421
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,830
innovations that alter the environment

422
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,899
it's the ones in the top two rights

423
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:15,879
revolutionary breakthrough so when the

424
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,470
business books are telling you to take

425
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,499
risks to start to write through make

426
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:24,490
mistakes they are visionary space

427
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,850
they're taking risks in revolutionary

428
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,330
and breakthrough innovations those are

429
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,769
the innovations we want if you really

430
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,110
want to risk because when I first set

431
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,779
one so again it's still not a map to

432
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,159
something but this is probably more

433
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,499
represent writes Moore's game what it

434
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:47,080
would look like the class answered not

435
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,269
my change this third axis right I gave

436
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:50,830
it a little hint to it already still not

437
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,259
mathlete crap but I might change it now

438
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:57,730
and call it all bit of success I gave it

439
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,220
away right which ones have a high spot

440
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,200
expects the ones that are blue and red

441
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,230
ones are green the ones are greeting

442
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,909
right we have greater higher

443
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:08,560
probabilities assessment

444
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,580
and sustaining innovations it's because

445
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,280
your your targeted users your target

446
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,350
market already exists you have you can

447
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,270
do market research you can get the data

448
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,340
when you're doing things for new markets

449
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,230
we have no idea what's gonna happen

450
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,420
right it's called an experiment we've

451
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,680
heard a little bit about that from some

452
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,170
of the talks today if you remember

453
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,930
Colonel Stanton this opening address at

454
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,660
the very end he said be brave all right

455
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,580
what else do you say be brave be be

456
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,330
creative

457
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,730
yeah be brave be creative that's what

458
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,920
this talk is about I'm hoping to

459
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,690
encourage creativity but in the right

460
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,280
ways now hopefully if you understand

461
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,500
what quadrants of innovation that you're

462
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,750
targeting either as individually or as a

463
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,910
group as a company you might have

464
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,890
creative success that's again still not

465
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,260
so mathematicians perspective but this

466
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,060
is probably what these quadrants would

467
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,190
look like more representative skill wise

468
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,920
to find that through so let's take a

469
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,580
look now again I tell my cadets right

470
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,760
prove to me in numbers I looked at not

471
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,310
too far right using history this notion

472
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,380
of the green revolt happy in 1910 1911

473
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,230
it's not too far away right five six

474
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,650
years ago a little bit history lesson

475
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,850
remember how many countries revolted

476
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,950
yeah WikiLeaks when they released our

477
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,050
cables their State Department cables US

478
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,820
State Department cables I said a lot

479
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,710
more allies in this country aren't in

480
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,310
this region our attention video pretty

481
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,580
corrupt

482
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,349
[Music]

483
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,320
quickly spread to 13 other countries so

484
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,660
began small data size 14 countries and

485
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,000
was working but this time interesting

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
how many of these countries actually

487
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,470
successfully revolted were in their king

488
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,050
or their leader was deposed immediately

489
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm not saying years later immediately

490
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,720
deposed

491
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:36,600
well first one it also happened in Yemen

492
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,650
they're still having problems era but

493
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,010
that the King black team flew out to

494
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:51,010
England somewhere I'm sorry Egypt Yemen

495
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,050
and the fourth was Libyan right Gadhafi

496
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,450
Gadhafi film writing was killed two

497
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,100
years later so 4 out of 14 all right so

498
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,510
you if you want to do the math there you

499
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,000
can I've done the parsley right I don't

500
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,290
like having general scheme math and

501
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,150
focus I do the math for them but I don't

502
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,520
really consider Egypt a revolutionary

503
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,560
success what happen in Egypt military

504
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,540
takeover right so that's not really a

505
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,390
revolution that's cool a military coup

506
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,550
and being in the military myself I just

507
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,040
know how dangerous militaries all right

508
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:38,110
the military is too which is why from US

509
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,810
perspective all the military folks in

510
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,950
here know that's when they move us

511
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,889
like every possibility right

512
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:49,389
we sort of learn from the Romans read

513
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,820
funny philosopher figure what what was

514
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,210
bad with Roman armies Roman legions it

515
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,100
was very dangerous when they closed the

516
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:06,159
Roman legions I'll come back to the Rome

517
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,960
bad things happen

518
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,730
remember Julius Caesar it's your

519
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,929
military coup so I don't tell feature so

520
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:21,340
here are the stats I was actually

521
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,629
surprised by this how high this one I'm

522
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,239
using this as an analogy for describing

523
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,739
at least mathematically even witnesses

524
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:32,460
what I'll probably success for rubbish

525
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,850
21% in this case I know we have still a

526
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,999
question mark in Syria Syria is still

527
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:42,759
debatable right unfortunately with my

528
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,049
studies and Conor insurgency operations

529
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:46,629
and insurgent forces the fact that

530
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,950
Russian has stepped in against the US

531
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,299
and the fact that Assad is fighting

532
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,940
those forces aggressively it is not

533
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,039
looking good for the insurgency's yeah

534
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,720
don't believe the hype this has long

535
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,210
wars favor in certain long wars you're

536
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,100
not favoring the surgeons it only favors

537
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,749
them if they have the willpower if they

538
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,429
run out of us support they run out

539
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,220
logistics certainties failed very

540
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,080
quickly and they can get rid of

541
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,330
leadership very quickly that's not the

542
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,499
number one guy definitely kill the

543
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:16,149
number one guy and a number two guy my

544
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:21,820
folks missed that yeah okay so getting

545
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,919
back to this notion of okay so this

546
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,970
makes it a little bit more realistic

547
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,759
right maybe 20% maybe single bit of

548
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,739
scream like for single digits but I'd

549
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:31,299
like to think of it as majorly batting

550
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,190
averages right okay that's the easier

551
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,580
for me to remember major bebang averages

552
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,350
the problem is Hollywood once again

553
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,509
Hollywood gives us the impression that

554
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:43,269
revolutions are easy watch all these

555
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,690
movies

556
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,919
in the problems we're so easy the king

557
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,779
Star Trek fan I'm a Star Wars fan

558
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:17,509
okay so instead fathers tough business

559
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:17,960
right

560
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:26,720
it was I'll cut this out I'll cut this

561
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,970
out yeah sounds like that yeah cuz

562
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,440
really the one empire figures it out

563
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,749
right the empire figures up these rebels

564
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:35,989
are causing a problem right in this

565
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,970
evolutionary space where Darth Vader

566
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,499
come up with to take care of the

567
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:44,299
problems with this breakthrough the

568
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,590
Death Star the Death Star is a

569
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,789
breakthrough innovation might taste a

570
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,070
long time to bill it's cuz the role the

571
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:55,789
rebels destroy too long right right one

572
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,129
week time lots Rd lots of Matt hardened

573
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:00,320
cream topping well we just needed to do

574
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,429
with you the force but let's draw a

575
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,249
favor figure out a very bad news for

576
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:09,529
revolutionaries right that's me what we

577
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,659
don't see impression that thing that's

578
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:13,460
why for me Star Wars Episode five was a

579
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,570
better episode as well

580
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,109
you like the baby on that okay let's see

581
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,389
another way of looking at instead of Lee

582
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:24,470
added a quadrant you find okay this came

583
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,679
really I'm going to show the site the

584
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,690
author's again but this notion of these

585
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,909
green innovation for a sustaining

586
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:32,840
evolutionary

587
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,879
it's really it's not like there's no

588
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,289
improvement over time it does improve

589
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:38,149
over time but it's incremental small

590
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,899
changes there's breakthrough innovations

591
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,580
if you look at a graph here is that it

592
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,960
jumps the curb that's like I'll break

593
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,220
through the in parentheses jumping the

594
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,109
curb right you actually going beyond

595
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,139
what the market needs that's innovation

596
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:52,729
it's changing the environment has

597
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,019
potential this successful

598
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,110
what about revolutionary

599
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,310
where did they start you don't have the

600
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,350
same resources of folks in green I ask

601
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,880
my lovely buttons in terms of military

602
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,580
revolution you are starting off at the

603
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,490
bottom okay and not only are you worse

604
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,160
off like if you're working and your

605
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,710
dress-up box on the revolutionary scale

606
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,320
you are initially far worse that were

607
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,240
pretty mission before were somewhere to

608
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,570
mainstream earnings so how these things

609
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,800
succeed right this notion of disruptive

610
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,450
innovations came from to Harvard

611
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,220
Business School professors Joseph power

612
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,530
when Christensen it's amazing

613
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:38,640
they say this this what they thought was

614
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,160
seemingly contradictory how can folks

615
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,070
that create products there are far worse

616
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,590
than what the market already has succeed

617
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,330
I told you the percentage are small

618
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,000
right major league bakeries well let's

619
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,040
think about some of these xerox vs.

620
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,640
Canon I'm thinking about the older folks

621
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,950
search does anyone remember what the

622
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,200
print divisions right your companies

623
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,450
even like an academic institution what

624
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,310
how big was those print divisions

625
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,680
remember print divisions come up a copy

626
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,710
room division could be the core of size

627
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,600
of this room it's because Xerox kept

628
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,700
focusing on the best customer we teach

629
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:34,000
to our customers the IBM's the big

630
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
companies that can afford and what the

631
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,960
latest features what can I do hard canon

632
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,640
disrupt Xerox yeah they went for me what

633
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,270
was that was their market right new

634
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,080
market was no longer big companies their

635
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,380
new market was home-based business was

636
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,970
the inferior to us

637
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,190
Xerox last I can write when they came

638
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,600
out with that

639
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:08,570
especially agents they laughing yeah but

640
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,730
what was the what was the okay what was

641
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,080
the value that made it smell appeal from

642
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,830
the market but really what was the one

643
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,510
you can't grow a business in the

644
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:38,300
lifetime o FF I mean couple hundred

645
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,590
dollars still expensive

646
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,120
we're in both we'd have to see today but

647
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,340
compared to a Xerox printer holy smokes

648
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,870
you can afford that

649
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,050
same thing with right IBM Apple what

650
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,160
Apple focus on cross that mention here

651
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,330
that Apple 2e right green screens

652
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,640
cheaper focus on out consumers IBM

653
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:07,610
focused on mainframes right why would we

654
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,340
have these great matrix right 10 times

655
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,220
the speed computationally

656
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,700
computationally they're on the Green

657
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,140
Line superior to the Apple 2e but IBM

658
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,070
left that out Apple appeal to the home

659
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:29,150
based market and again it was but weird

660
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:35,480
vibe is better performance in those pcs

661
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,990
to where point intersects we passed that

662
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,090
point now right of course Mike going

663
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:46,010
back when we follow another exam hobby

664
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:55,220
how the tech business remembers right

665
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,910
all these folks grew up thinking those

666
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,320
are good vehicles right back my

667
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,830
seventies couthon into is a great

668
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,840
vehicle back descendants they're small

669
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,940
right they don't have a lot acceleration

670
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,090
but if the attributes for the American

671
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,500
my space la space we like power right we

672
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,140
like that people go fast very quickly

673
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,180
what about this change this wasn't

674
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,510
really a market consumer market external

675
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,870
what was it I don't bargain 1979 right

676
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,050
1979 oil embargo so what became the the

677
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,650
future that's one feature folks one new

678
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,410
market one fuel efficiency right

679
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,580
so was this external shock that causes

680
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,350
to market behavior shift ah more larvae

681
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,750
example more larvae example this

682
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,950
actually came from an audience member

683
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,330
asking questions

684
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:13,750
this is we are back right we can't be

685
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,239
promised the government they give us

686
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,600
blackberries it still have security

687
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,060
there's the last but their market shares

688
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,130
one percent now at the height when

689
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,610
President Obama when he was doing called

690
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,889
the CrackBerry Blackbird a grim had

691
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,870
about 21 percent market share about 1

692
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,340
percent now they do have their own

693
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,230
smartphone down but to compete with

694
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:46,929
Google LG Samsung if you if you attended

695
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,780
Jason's talk on presentation styles I've

696
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,000
given you right I'm giving you the

697
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,590
concrete examples here right there's no

698
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,719
way to assume I'm gonna give you a

699
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,949
little more flexible you get it right

700
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:59,680
when you think about other examples

701
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,860
today it exists all over the place

702
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,060
so if you know the question of rather

703
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,270
revolutionary innovations exist think

704
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,580
about sports

705
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,050
does it revolutionary innovation taking

706
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,160
place sports everyone read Michael loses

707
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,000
Moneyball sabermetrics the notion that

708
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,530
you can be or get these gecko

709
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,900
the Yankees or Red Sox when in the

710
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,150
Oakland A's but just by using statistics

711
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,790
is readily available we've talked about

712
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,430
a lot a lot of talks today right that's

713
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,620
revolutionary if you leverage that and

714
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,270
you go against their conventional grain

715
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,370
which was right go against the grain of

716
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:45,620
the traditional sports scouts do

717
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,930
statistics TV shows

718
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,590
aren't we in and dated with reality TV

719
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,160
game shows

720
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,500
those are revolutionary innovation very

721
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,690
cheap doesn't cost much to write script

722
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,430
right for a reality TV there is no

723
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,470
script there's just anything write and

724
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,060
edit in less than five seconds that's

725
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,660
what I learned also induces movies do we

726
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,710
have four examples of revolutionaries

727
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,840
very cheap movies that did very well

728
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,260
there whoops

729
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,900
that's working my mind yeah of course

730
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,610
there's also examples like to find the

731
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,080
breakthrough ones to write Transformers

732
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,140
a lot of high-tech CGI news we're not

733
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:27,440
using a 24 hour cycle I I report er

734
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,000
right anyone can report on the news now

735
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,530
and CNN will take it up

736
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,600
that's why HLN is no longer region

737
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,310
called headline news right it's like the

738
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,170
mystery channel now holy smokes

739
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,280
yeah even CNN is being disrupted by

740
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,420
disruptive games restaurants every

741
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,550
actually almost every single restaurant

742
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,290
that starts up unless you're a chain

743
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,660
like franchisee you're if you're

744
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,460
franchisees you're in this green space

745
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,890
right any new restaurant really is a

746
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,560
disruptive innovation revolution you

747
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,450
think your food is better than everyone

748
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,190
else's that's being start with do you

749
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,600
have experience yet they've learned I

750
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,960
know you're trying to hear new markets

751
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,220
technology right it's Saturday this goes

752
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,000
on and on forever

753
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,070
so again disruptive revolutionary

754
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,900
relations taking place every day every

755
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,990
muck shark tank that is all whole

756
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,660
revolution innovations right so if you

757
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,090
understand the space right revolutionary

758
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,160
innovations you cannot get money from

759
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,230
banks banks give money to folks in the

760
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,540
screen space do you need venture

761
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,340
capitalists angel investors bridge

762
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,150
investors

763
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,859
this red space what about blue space if

764
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,809
you're looking for money who funds blue

765
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:39,440
space right government's funny if you're

766
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,180
smart chemical so you'll be doing it if

767
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,099
you're a smart guy that's not really

768
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:47,450
don't know I don't disparage

769
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,099
breakthrough innovations I'll just try

770
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,510
and promote more revolutionary

771
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,900
innovations let's see now yeah so really

772
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,430
this notion of I sort of gave it away

773
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,349
right how can we best protect cyberspace

774
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:59,569
if you're both you've been there right

775
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,859
everyone this room I'm trying to do that

776
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:02,750
even if you're a pen tester you're not

777
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,490
you trying to make defense better so

778
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,170
what are the innovations that we need

779
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,510
well yeah I focus this is pop on

780
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,640
revolutionary innovations we do need

781
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,980
them but we also need breakthrough

782
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,900
innovations we also need to sustain an

783
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,670
evolutionary but really we need all

784
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,380
types of the nation's but what this

785
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,150
framework tells you though is if you

786
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,670
really want to take risks if you want to

787
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,470
change the way they do want to go for

788
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,829
the top - if you want to go for the low

789
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:29,809
hanging fruit and the immediate

790
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,329
victories go for the bottom - right

791
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,160
so gives you a framework for how you can

792
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,720
do things if you're an individual

793
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,549
company right with less than 50 people

794
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,809
you're probably gonna be in the

795
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,760
revolutionary space if you're a vendor

796
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,869
that's outside getting government

797
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:46,010
contracts yeah okay so it gives you a

798
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,380
framework for what types of innovation

799
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,200
are most appropriate and for your

800
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,750
success and that's what we want right

801
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,339
successful innovations here's the

802
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:57,430
problem if you do not consider

803
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,630
disruptive revolutionary innovations how

804
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,039
I get this is coming from a military

805
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,940
perspective don't officer words that we

806
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,119
didn't win okay so what we didn't win

807
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,670
sorry the Korean War what happened the

808
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,390
Korean War yeah yes the North Koreans

809
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,829
right the North Korea did not have more

810
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:16,609
MacArthur

811
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:18,650
push them all back North Koreans were

812
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,240
decimated yeah no military

813
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,970
China came in estimates were anywhere

814
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,190
from 200,000 to 300,000 initially cost

815
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,670
me Alvin

816
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,980
from October of

817
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,020
fifteen overall million Chinese

818
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,920
volunteers right but what wasn't the

819
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,559
Chinese did well they asked at this

820
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,670
point differently

821
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,710
what MacArthur rely on this was again

822
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,859
1950 coming out of World War two what

823
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,280
was his intelligence asset that he liked

824
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,960
what just came into arrow forget

825
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,220
airplanes had pictures

826
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,530
what film right so it's what film so

827
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,750
what film became the new breakthrough

828
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,130
innovation for the US military

829
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,390
yeah we have a nice reconnaissance

830
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,200
aircraft what's wrong don't think you

831
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,720
need darkness the Chinese military

832
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,920
whether or not they knew or not when

833
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,349
they were their soldiers to conduct

834
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,750
movements huge maneuvers strictly at

835
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,430
night by punishment of death right the

836
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,348
one Chinese captain that had the pistol

837
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,530
they were moving at night gentlemen

838
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,030
Carthage Jake to consistently

839
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,319
underestimate military you can

840
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:33,690
underestimate by three you underestimate

841
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,970
my tank you're gonna lose a foot you're

842
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:41,579
in time that's your what about being

843
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,230
honor we talk about me and I'm earlier

844
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,700
were that was successfully with the US

845
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,520
Navy not so much human trail the fact

846
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,930
that we could bomb the Ho Chi Minh Trail

847
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,349
and just obliterate the belong at North

848
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:57,450
Vietnamese supply lines what's the

849
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,099
problem about notion if your supply

850
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,250
lines aren't tied to this supply trail

851
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:08,849
it's not tied to infrastructure this

852
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:10,319
modern operation that you're learning

853
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,780
from bullying this mind is right this

854
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,790
notion of nolo train doesn't exist for

855
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,579
dis my operations that's what happened

856
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:18,990
right we bombed heck out of ho chi minh

857
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,960
killa usually didn't know a factory yes

858
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,900
supply lines continue on now overtime

859
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,540
right the Vietcong and North Vietnamese

860
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,930
they develop the road networks because

861
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,670
it was so successful again we stopped

862
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,069
our bombing campaign from fall of 1969

863
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:38,250
as well when that happened yeah

864
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,010
build road networks there's my stuff um

865
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,440
Iraq Afghanistan what was the number one

866
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,880
killer number one neighbor on the

867
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,420
bathroom and where's my TV staff are in

868
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,890
the very name of it is telling you this

869
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,349
is a revolutionary destructive pranks it

870
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,060
relaxes my even no weapon systems an

871
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,050
improvised weapon okay so that's a

872
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,490
system that it's causing they thought

873
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,349
sure over time it improves right all the

874
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:06,359
time it went sustaining over time right

875
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:13,140
if they started using copper right it

876
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,150
was done in weapons that ammunition is

877
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,840
found long battlefield cyber warfare my

878
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,380
argument is that the first instance of

879
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,540
most malware is disruptive and

880
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:30,480
revolutionary anyone want to counter me

881
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,700
on that there are some examples of

882
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,109
breakthrough I'm thinking Stuxnet but

883
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:39,599
again this form I can I can't confirm or

884
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,310
deny that the US or Israel had any

885
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,550
involvement when stuck now but if you

886
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,810
watch the movie zero days right that's

887
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,700
why as an academic right I'm silent zero

888
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,890
days if you watch movie zero days it

889
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,530
says the US and Israel had snow I can't

890
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,140
confirm it viable

891
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,930
let's see now for cyber office so this

892
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,089
notion of where cyber offense resides

893
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:06,810
nice flight I'm thinking really it's not

894
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,290
just it's not just rubbish right it does

895
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,670
exist and sustained it doesn't history

896
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,160
it also exists in breakthrough but a

897
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,140
very small amount writing stuff right

898
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:23,160
very especially stuff at one point I'm

899
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,810
not like most X 10.9 Stuxnet 1.0

900
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,490
especially for why do there's not what

901
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm talking about now if you can trust

902
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,480
this with cyber defense right cyber

903
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,930
defense yeah we're doing a lot of

904
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,190
breakthrough right the US government

905
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,570
this love breakthrough contract a lot of

906
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,630
that evolutionary exists sustained I

907
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,320
don't think we're doing as much

908
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,080
revolutionary cyber defense now I'm

909
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,690
excluding folks from this room

910
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,630
investing you guys are I think you're

911
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,880
doing

912
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,600
revolutionary defense but my argument is

913
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,070
if you look at these two graphs

914
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,290
side-by-side again as a military

915
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,170
intelligence officer yeah breakthrough

916
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:11,180
innovations or offense we didn't need to

917
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,530
exist right there's so many backdoors

918
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,720
that you can find because you can stay

919
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,240
in the revolutionary space if you're on

920
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,090
the defensive side however if we give up

921
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,500
on the revolutionary defensive measures

922
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,020
we're giving the attacker too much time

923
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,190
right let me talk to you

924
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,980
characteristics of breakthrough nation

925
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,460
that's it

926
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,590
lots of lead time again both

927
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,360
revolutionary and breakthrough in this

928
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,060
scene tall big success so if you're

929
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,680
leaving that gap you're exposing

930
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,350
yourself to a lot of time where the

931
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,720
adversary has the ability not only to

932
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,540
revolutionary but go down to singing and

933
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,490
evolutionary as well and that is makes

934
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,440
it tough for the defensive side that's

935
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,400
my my argument this presentation and

936
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,820
here really this is my second last slide

937
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,150
this is where I get my text right Jason

938
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,160
and that previous talk my presentations

939
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,860
he said yeah stories yeah this is really

940
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,100
my my well my final thoughts so I will

941
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,670
go through this slowly just as Jason

942
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,710
recommended okay most revolutions fail

943
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,110
just remember them don't believe star

944
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,880
wars right don't believe starboard most

945
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,680
revolutions fail but that's where the

946
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,330
greatest change had so if you're looking

947
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,450
to make experiments if you're looking to

948
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,880
do innovation that's a groundbreaking

949
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,160
and causes lots of change look in the

950
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,010
revolutionary breakthrough space because

951
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,630
it's tough because once right Darth

952
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,160
Vader figures all you're doing that if

953
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,900
they're smart they'll laugh at you

954
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,210
they're smart they're gonna try and take

955
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,100
that space with me they're gonna control

956
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,930
market share rather than the innovation

957
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,540
zone

958
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,340
Green is again the sustaining and

959
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,670
incremental nations now if you want to

960
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,970
encourage revolutionary

961
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,280
the best ways last night you want to be

962
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,180
a brilliant doctor experimentation

963
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,020
preferably cheap fast and many many

964
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,240
iterations you want many iterations so

965
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,830
we learned that in elementary school

966
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,480
when you're doing experiments don't walk

967
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,400
your first one you do it many times

968
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,550
sample size n you want bigger bigger

969
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,440
than 30 sample size the hand bigger than

970
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,859
30 so fast cheap though that's what's

971
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,800
got to be I wasn't I was a NASA fellow

972
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,380
so I saw a lot of what NASA was trying

973
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,930
to do trying to be disruptive it was

974
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,820
just monitor DNA that's why I say from

975
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,880
the Air Force Air Force will not give an

976
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,260
Air Force contract for them to be

977
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,050
disruptive they are so ingrained in that

978
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,030
blue space for breakthrough on keeping

979
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,010
their right they like satellites they

980
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,390
like high-tech stuff I'm gonna keep you

981
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,980
in there from the military who do I

982
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,540
think is great for destructive but more

983
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,270
specific Navy did some things right I

984
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:58,020
tell you Top Gun seals right seals they

985
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,790
have to rely on themselves small man

986
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,430
teams club man teams that most shields

987
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:02,970
are great

988
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,150
Special Forces for the army hopefully

989
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,580
our cyber teams hopefully our cyber

990
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,720
teams are thinking this way

991
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,599
disruptive invasions experiment I also

992
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,320
like Coast Guard I like the breeze like

993
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,900
Marines because again they are at the

994
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,550
Coast Guard and the Marines get the

995
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,190
leftovers whoo Navy in the army so they

996
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,869
have to make it work yeah wow that's

997
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:27,210
insane wrong but they make it work well

998
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,560
that's for me

999
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,320
a revolutionary sign now attributes of

1000
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,760
when you do it right when you do

1001
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,920
experimentation right right be bold be

1002
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,240
creative - outside the box think

1003
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,770
hopefully what it does is it creates

1004
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,260
this notion of being more creative and

1005
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,300
being able to take risks okay that's

1006
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,940
really the bottom line I think really

1007
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,040
what the colonel Stan was talking about

1008
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,430
earlier

1009
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:59,430
here yeah here here is my last time it

1010
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,540
really think the last thing I really

1011
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,490
wanted to get out here is like just like

1012
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,940
our mill turning our failures right in

1013
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,730
the Korean War Vietnam War even the

1014
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,710
failures in Iraq with gas tank failures

1015
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,470
right now father or not war

1016
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,240
alright sheep the South Army says we're

1017
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,550
not cyber war we're getting we're gonna

1018
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:21,780
attack that right everyone is taking our

1019
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,270
if we don't do experiments though what

1020
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,589
we're left with is we're left with the

1021
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:27,290
evolutionary sustaining innovations

1022
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,400
right we might have some breakthrough

1023
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,660
right the Air Force I know loves doing

1024
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:30,990
that

1025
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,609
DARPA is doing a lot of that NASA is

1026
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,190
doing a lot of that yeah now if you

1027
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,349
don't do it revolutionary innovation the

1028
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,440
problem is we get we don't do these

1029
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,420
failures we don't get to learn from this

1030
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,250
space that's the problem not learning

1031
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,900
all right we keep saying we're learning

1032
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,970
organization we said that a lot through

1033
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,609
the wars of against and in Iraq right we

1034
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:52,200
say we're learning organization that's

1035
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,020
let's experiment because I don't want to

1036
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,270
be a military that's just a non zero

1037
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,549
defects mentality does anyone remember

1038
00:48:59,549 --> 00:49:01,530
that terminology we said that sounds

1039
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:04,740
like a great thing right cool Powell

1040
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,450
used to say that he's pop by his

1041
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:13,770
mistakes I don't want to just be non

1042
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,680
zero defects mentality army it's great

1043
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,609
that we're doing that right yeah we

1044
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:19,290
don't fly our folks right especially for

1045
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,910
you tenants yeah we don't fire flicks

1046
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,940
nearly from make mistakes right but I

1047
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,920
want to go beyond just the non Judy fix

1048
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,829
mentality I want us to be with an

1049
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:30,750
experimenting frame line now we want

1050
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,130
them especially right in the spread

1051
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,569
space I want us to be revolutionary

1052
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:36,210
experimenters low-cost cheap many

1053
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,700
experiments yeah let the Air Force they

1054
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,720
were doing experiments to in the

1055
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,430
breakthrough side but they have a better

1056
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,599
DNA with maybe success experiments those

1057
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,829
are expensive now if you fail in that

1058
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:50,940
area it's time again seems right at best

1059
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,390
maybe bad manners I think with that

1060
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,480
here's a citation of all beer I think

1061
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,930
all the movies and all the quotes I used

1062
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,230
Barry

1063
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,540
built and the B size team everyone in

1064
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,640
green here thank you

1065
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,720
our Moustakas - we host our own

1066
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,260
conference again my very first iteration

1067
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,570
of this talk that Mike Bukowski duck

1068
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,680
Mycoskie moderated was at the last us

1069
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,060
cyclone that took place in October last

1070
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,880
year our very next one is six to seven

1071
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,560
that's right seven to eight November in

1072
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,020
Washington DC so if you're interested in

1073
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,650
attending we cap our tents at 500 but we

1074
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,050
still already think accept not open call

1075
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,420
for papers is done not just to go I got

1076
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,330
rejected from round two

1077
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,090
so again log great speakers should be at

1078
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:43,560
this conference that's why I know how

1079
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,420
much effort goes into the production of

1080
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,920
commerce like this I wanna thank
