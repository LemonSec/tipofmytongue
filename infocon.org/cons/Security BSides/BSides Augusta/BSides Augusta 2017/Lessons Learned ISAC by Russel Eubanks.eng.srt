1
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,190
so awesome to be here I remember the day

2
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,410
back when the folks from Augusta had to

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,420
come to b-sides Atlanta take the trip

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,250
literally this morning me and several

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,720
folks on my team got in the car drove

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,059
here I woke up at four or got here right

7
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,000
on time and so excited to be here so

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,199
wonderful look at all the cyber things

9
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,660
happening in this area all the

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,180
opportunity for us to learn something so

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,059
who's learned something today that also

12
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,820
we get to come here hang out together

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,680
glorious day here getting to learn some

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,940
things and so I'm really happy about

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,680
that

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:17,200
the best as cheaply as you can we'll

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
talk about that framework to think about

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,060
how can we go and be better security

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,429
practitioners as cheaply as possible I

20
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:27,100
have one Astra come here for the lessons

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,140
learned Isaac the hat trick means it

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,210
doesn't think this but I want to call

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,369
you to be invited to be a part of this

24
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:37,500
movement here in this talk today a

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,630
little bit about me things I get to work

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,520
at prove it to do and working bunch of

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,009
cool places and really want to mention

28
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,380
that I'm really speaking for myself with

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,149
respect to the comments that I'll make

30
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,100
in class today and so with that setting

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,979
the stage a little bit I think now it's

32
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,409
a city think of it in terms of whatever

33
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,229
industry that you might be in how can

34
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,520
you work together some collection

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,080
registering initiatives that really

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,080
allow us as security practitioners to

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,020
learn from frankly our competitors where

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,730
do the things we work in where security

39
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,040
team gets us to learn from the Comcast

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,459
security financial services financial

41
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,380
organization and indications of

42
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,300
compromised threats that occur the

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,440
latest phishing attacks are happening

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,680
and we do that to position ourselves so

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,400
that we can learn for us to learn and be

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,340
a part of this in our areas and again

47
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,310
especially through the means to learn

48
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,380
and share this information a BS of

49
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,750
course it to someone in our industry we

50
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,970
can learn those lessons apply those to

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,220
our defenses and Neeley of course to be

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,680
able to avoid those issues and our

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,040
respective environments I'll never

54
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,530
forget what my son who is much much

55
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,860
older now

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:28,810
we gave bucks if I suppose be nice to

57
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,799
this when we're eager to learn about

58
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,209
things we were shown that we should

59
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,390
share what are the ways we can share the

60
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,920
difference the things that happened to

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,840
us the things that we can share with

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,700
each other through in a protected

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,959
environment or even through

64
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,459
relationships that we've made perhaps

65
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,920
today you're gonna guess what would it

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,340
look like if we were to by default be

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,109
able to share information I'm not

68
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,900
talking about the nasty the ugly things

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,329
but the things that we can use to learn

70
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:05,079
from each other as trusted colleagues in

71
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,299
many cases I see the default is to deny

72
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,920
to say though I don't want to share that

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,200
I don't want you think

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,310
[Music]

75
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,089
to Oakland our eyes to how can we tear

76
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,620
things what are the things that we can

77
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,180
learn from each other to make our

78
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,780
communities better very brief overview

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,550
of looking at and how we're gonna frame

80
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,230
this risk - this conversation is around

81
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,210
just looking at a bit the process of it

82
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,830
and like you've seen these you've

83
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,270
learned these you've studied about these

84
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,430
you spend a lot of time in these maybe

85
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,990
you have a tattoo that lists all the

86
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,150
steps that you can go through it should

87
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,889
go through in order to effectively

88
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,960
handle and dispose of a security

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,290
incident I want to focus on and invite

90
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,540
you to consider the opportunity to learn

91
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,460
from these capture these lessons learn

92
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,250
the things that you have come to learn

93
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,720
as we're sort of responding to incidents

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,610
learning the expensive way learning the

95
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,919
hard way and helping to inform better

96
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,040
our preparation steps how can we better

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,229
be equipped to respond to these and

98
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:05,700
again what are the things that we can

99
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,919
share with our colleagues those in our

100
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
trusted industries to be able to help

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,850
them as well what are the ways we can do

102
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,760
that again to inform our improvements

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,580
and response in our given areas the

104
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,830
wages we can learn the ways that we can

105
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,800
share how is it that we can again when

106
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,479
we learn these lessons when we go

107
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,800
through the six seven cent Halley

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,140
process we have got wisdom very

109
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,940
expensively if it responds 49 the

110
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,720
weekends

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,060
your boss breathing down your neck and

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,919
say what's wrong get the system's back

113
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,840
online all their urgency all the stress

114
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,000
that's the opposite that's the hard way

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,639
to learn our lessons how can we learn

116
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,470
these easier happening when those are

117
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,270
applied make sure that we're prepared

118
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,310
and equipment to make sure that we never

119
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,330
ever ever have to fail that same way

120
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,520
again what are the ways that we can do

121
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,070
that what is what are some informative

122
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,020
references we can look at to say how can

123
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,100
we learn this way how can

124
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,300
get wisdom as cheaply as we can a lot of

125
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,950
sources it would help us know that

126
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,440
information it's fast thing to look at

127
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,330
all the reports that's here what is

128
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,180
happening in information security on an

129
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,130
annual basis many reports like the ones

130
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,170
that you're seeing here tell us what is

131
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,350
the categories what are the themes what

132
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,370
are the things that happen in

133
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,590
organizations without maybe their names

134
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,330
and porting the fingers and just showing

135
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,890
all the gory details of business and

136
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:39,340
response references some of these

137
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,200
reports have been out for ten or more

138
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,380
years we read we mark our calendar we

139
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,230
can't wait to get that information

140
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,000
what's unfortunate is it tells us the

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,010
same thing year over here over here we

142
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,780
can't wait to get to know what's gonna

143
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,790
happen this time but it is always the

144
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,610
same information we learn about

145
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,590
information security attacks and

146
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,800
incidents from third parties even when

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,740
we have all of our security controls we

148
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,690
have our socks we look at our logs we

149
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,920
monitor all the things we do for

150
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,070
compliance reasons and yet we continue

151
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,810
to learn about this from outside parties

152
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,140
this number is actually getting worse

153
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,930
how long have these attackers been in

154
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,290
our organization before we know about it

155
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,520
most recent Verizon data breach

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,590
investigation report tells us that it's

157
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,870
gotten worse now it's average of twenty

158
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,770
months twenty months ago someone broke

159
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,680
into our I want us to be offended by

160
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,980
that we should take that personally

161
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,260
that's too long think about that twenty

162
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,030
months from now something knowing about

163
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,170
something that we should be dealing with

164
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,310
what are the things that we can do to

165
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,170
better position ourselves to know when

166
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,210
that's happening to determine when this

167
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,000
is happening in our arm it's much much

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,800
faster how can we shrink that time

169
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,470
knowing what to do knowing what to look

170
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:11,930
for

171
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,310
going through the instant response like

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,229
I mentioned earlier that's the expensive

173
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:20,560
way I invite you to occasionally

174
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,169
occasionally sit back and look at the

175
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,940
forks like all force level thinking what

176
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,710
are the ways that we can't say stepping

177
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,870
back not looking at the day-to-day the

178
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,150
tactical things but look for things that

179
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:43,969
might emerge maybe on a quarterly to be

180
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:46,670
able to help increase the level of

181
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,470
maturity of your security controllers

182
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,050
your prevention your detection and your

183
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,839
response what are the trends that you're

184
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,720
seeing over time it's nice to look at

185
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,540
our security metrics it's nicer to be

186
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,160
able to step back and say how does this

187
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,110
compare over time perhaps to that's 30

188
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,959
days perhaps the last 30 months to give

189
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:14,950
us more context by being intentional

190
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,390
what if we are purposed what if we were

191
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,980
bound to do this to ourselves something

192
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,339
as simple as putting a calendar reminder

193
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:28,820
that says what are the themes what are

194
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,860
the categories what's the learning that

195
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,900
I can apply in our given environments

196
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,170
some say to continue to do the same

197
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,420
thing and expect a different outcome is

198
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,160
what don't be insane it's a part of this

199
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,720
what are the ways that we can learn this

200
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,029
information as a part of instant

201
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,920
response as a part of having information

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,420
share with us that security

203
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,490
practitioners in trusted environments

204
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,250
just like this one of the things that we

205
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,320
can collect themselves from now on I'm

206
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:08,690
always going to and from now on what are

207
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,910
the things that help inform to make our

208
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,709
teams better to make our response time

209
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,339
even faster when these things occur when

210
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,870
we're expecting things different what

211
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,980
are the ways that we can

212
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,050
look for this if only there was a method

213
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,930
to be able to to look at and show this

214
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,300
one of these is one of the areas that

215
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,769
would focus on part of is all the

216
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,260
critical security controls you probably

217
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,199
have a poster in your all the 20 things

218
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,720
that really help us understand what are

219
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,399
the ways that companies win at

220
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,010
information security and when we look at

221
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,060
these it's a way to consider a

222
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,399
multi-year journey that says how do we

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,769
improve in the critical areas areas

224
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:58,880
literally we're doing they're still able

225
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,570
to be successful when they scan look for

226
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,190
and try to break into our daily

227
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,920
environments we're looking at what are

228
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,410
ways that we can understand that look at

229
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,019
the categories understand those contexts

230
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,029
and literally be able to apply that to

231
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,279
better defending and protecting our

232
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,839
given networks many of us have

233
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,519
compliance requirements I call them our

234
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,920
pretty green check boxes the things that

235
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,660
we have to do whatever industry you're

236
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,399
in you probably have one or more

237
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,589
different sets of things that must be

238
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,260
done recognize why are you doing this

239
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,760
recognize how you are doing that in your

240
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,889
environment you're doing that because

241
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,370
someone made you do them you're smart

242
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,920
minute lasted so long because what made

243
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
us do it understanding that concept of

244
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,260
it's not because it's a thing to keep

245
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,760
your organization safe does it give us

246
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,660
because

247
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,360
it's worth to do that a little west of

248
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,829
Atlanta we've got a the amusement park

249
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,540
Six Flags Over Georgia

250
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,639
maybe you've been there think of the

251
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,279
clients like Six Flags Over Georgia you

252
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,800
must be this tall to ride rides that

253
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,660
give you loop-de-loop and fast things

254
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,699
make you want to throw up at the end you

255
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,600
can be taller just don't be shorter what

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,740
if you thought about your compliance

257
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:25,040
program and looking at that as an

258
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,259
opportunity to say what are the things

259
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,930
that I as a qualified security

260
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:40,519
professional in our given environment

261
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,279
how can we reach toward rates from

262
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,089
compliance towards security insurance

263
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,009
knowing that we know that we know our

264
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,209
house is in order

265
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,860
what are those things again that we can

266
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,959
leverage the things that we have to do

267
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,360
to make sure that we're doing the things

268
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,060
that good organizations do to defend and

269
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,079
better monitor their organizations a

270
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,370
great example of this is looking at

271
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,759
Department of City concepts and

272
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,519
literally made tremendous results when I

273
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,170
was first introduced to this all the

274
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,420
critical security controls it was about

275
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,560
looking at what the work that the

276
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,649
department stated in one year with

277
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,480
employees and every time around the

278
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,339
world they reduce vulnerabilities across

279
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,009
the board and documented it with metrics

280
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:32,720
that were produced matters so I asked

281
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,790
myself what am i doing Russell that can

282
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,709
reduce security vulnerabilities and my

283
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,100
organization's about 89% it's a very

284
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,480
quick conversation because there was

285
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,490
nothing that I was doing and so I wanted

286
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,439
to invest and learn and apply those

287
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,259
principles what's fascinating about the

288
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,970
Department of State implementation is

289
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,879
they only use three different sensors to

290
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,920
be able to collect ten different metrics

291
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,670
and those sensors are

292
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,370
that we have Active Directory and

293
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,140
networks canon and microsoft SCCM

294
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,610
to give metrics to compare one

295
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,040
department against another to be able to

296
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,260
show how effectively are they apply

297
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,510
these concepts and their organization

298
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,820
and again tremendous results by things

299
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,400
that probably you have and you would be

300
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,500
able to apply in your organization as

301
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,320
well what does it look like one of the

302
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,690
tools to be able to little free tools to

303
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,360
look at this is to do an assessment

304
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,930
against it for this particular

305
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,030
presentation being able to look at these

306
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,550
particular categories of these basic

307
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,890
things that we know to do back when we

308
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:44,400
were we were talking to our systems and

309
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,650
we're talking to monitor having an

310
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,340
inventory of authorized devices

311
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,110
authorized software on our network to be

312
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,460
able to know when these things change

313
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,100
and be able to inform better arts that

314
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,590
response teams to know and respond when

315
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,480
these things differences occur in our

316
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,640
environment shrinking that amount of

317
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,550
time that we're able to no shrinking

318
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,980
from twenty months that verizon tells us

319
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,690
how long it takes for the organization

320
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:19,650
to realize information in areas like

321
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,350
this what are the things that we can do

322
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,500
how long did you stand not to know that

323
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,600
there's been changes significant in your

324
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,580
environment there's a new domain

325
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,060
administrator a change to the running

326
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,350
configuration on your production

327
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,510
firewalls how long can you stand to not

328
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,070
know that what are the measures that we

329
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,640
can do to apply automation to know

330
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,710
when things like that change and happen

331
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:55,630
and occur in our environments what if we

332
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,340
had a culture of always wanting to make

333
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,250
it better in our organization what if we

334
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,530
could have this drive inside of us to

335
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,170
make our next time be the next the best

336
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,950
partners or friends and colleagues to be

337
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,390
able to shrink down that window or

338
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,020
respond faster to know quicker what if

339
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,150
you decided to give yourself a goal for

340
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,400
next year to level up your level of

341
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,430
maturity wherever you're at to be better

342
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,550
quicker faster at responding and knowing

343
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,170
when these things happen and your

344
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,850
environment what are some of the

345
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,520
strategies that we can do to apply that

346
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,720
one example that I'll give you as a

347
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,920
recent fans news became trends patterns

348
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,300
that we're seeing out in the environment

349
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,370
in French news up here that says what

350
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,930
are the things that are happening what's

351
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,550
the commentary with respect to these

352
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,710
news items and what can we do to apply

353
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,590
that in our environment taking these

354
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,900
stories and saying if these things were

355
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,120
to happen in our environment how would

356
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,370
we respond how quickly would we know

357
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,530
what this happened in our can using

358
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,680
these as perhaps exercises to apply and

359
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,710
look at and get that wisdom as cheaply

360
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,260
as possible what are the things that we

361
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,210
can use for our formative references

362
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,089
just like this to make our next time be

363
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,900
the best time perhaps taking exercises

364
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,400
like that and putting them into your

365
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,170
tabletop exercises with your instant

366
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,840
response team when this happens what do

367
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,120
we do here's how organizations have

368
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,730
responded to these how fast will we

369
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,860
respond would we even know using these

370
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,630
exercises not just when

371
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,760
what were all the reasons all the

372
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
barriers that we would have to be in

373
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,390
place what were all the things that

374
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,610
stopped us from being successful how

375
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,680
much like the news stories that we ready

376
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,350
is our organization and collecting the

377
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,360
list of the things to make our processes

378
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,510
better to make our detection factory how

379
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,550
can we collect these things and respond

380
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,720
better the next time a lot of other

381
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,840
areas looking at if you don't already

382
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,490
have relationships with your state local

383
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,770
federal law enforcement now's a great

384
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:23,780
time to have those in my mind and my

385
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,520
mind it makes me feel better knowing my

386
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,750
state local federal law enforcement

387
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,500
agencies by name ahead of time

388
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,570
it makes me think I'd get priority

389
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,760
service or frontal and services now does

390
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:45,320
it really I have no idea and really have

391
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,030
good relationships with those who can

392
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,280
help us into our time of need something
