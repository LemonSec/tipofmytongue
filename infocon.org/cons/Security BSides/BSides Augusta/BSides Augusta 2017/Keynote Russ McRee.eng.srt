just as soon as PowerPoint cooperates I

3
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:41,010
was going to say you cannot blame the

technical problems on Microsoft this

5
00:00:42,660 --> 00:01:39,270
morning yeah you may have to go through

6
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,550
the gross you may need to take on the

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,510
maybe you can do some things they're a

that's a huge problem

who seen Troy hunts have a have you

35
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,519
unfortunately as you'll see the second

36
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm on it multiple times

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,160
there are

[Music]

48
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,699

[Music]

52
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:18,180
each one of these steps that we use for

53
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,400
businesses of states and most often is

54
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,819
used

55
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,700
[Music]

56
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,360
it looks like a classic spreadsheet

57
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,790
right so the reality is as long as it's

58
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,270
in the perfect format you end up with

59
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,310
something that the script can parts and

60
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:40,170
again and the beauty is you get a nice

61
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,060
little visualization from exactly that

62
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:49,280
sing so I'm hoping it will start for us

63
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,530
I'll escape out for a second we'll do it

64
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:59,810
that way two seconds

65

[Music]

66
00:17:43,420 --> 00:18:19,280
this is each one of these again with

67
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,110
what is really a fundamentally limited

68
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,240
amount of code you get some very good

69
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:33,610
visual aspects the beauty

[Music]

86
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,340
so first visitation began preparing to

87
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,710
code record talk about the code what I

88
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,080
want you to get out of this is you can

89
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,190
measure very quickly

90
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,640
two minutes is reached week is false

91
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,590
means that's your original source tweet

92
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,930
and then obviously true and blue means

93
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,470
it's being retweeted your ability to

94
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,830
measure that by time of day can often be

95
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,639
immediate

96
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,520
additionally you contracted from an

97
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,340
interesting perspectives over this tweet

98
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,540
which is a first obviously caused a huge

99
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,940
spike thereafter in region's time of day

100
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,810
is also kind of interesting because you

101
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,910
can sort of assess is it in this

102
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,550
scenario is it one time I said that's

103
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,620
terrible right smack at noon

106
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:04,890
my smallest code what are the various

107
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:15,299
flying types using the mobile devices

108
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,809
the twitter brand is also the primary

109
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:41,760
user bouncies didn't throw up some text

110
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,700
word here these are the two pieces most

111
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,820
reach and squeeze so the most positive

112
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,649
tweet is a bunch of internet tech

113
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:51,120
companies had to work together to clean

114
00:24:51,120 --> 00:25:04,370
up working together that's fantastic

115
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:21,570
dangerous but killed and with that you

116
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,909
can actually visualize that how this

117
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:28,100
emotional balance change over the

118
00:25:40,609 --> 00:27:09,029
that's to clean up who's retweeting who

119
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:12,139
can be fascinating

little intense if you're not used to

125
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,070
lots of data opportunities any questions

126
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,850

the initial assessment based on just the

sheer numbers critical and obviously

145
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,080
what we care about instability temporal

146
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:35,860
environmental memorize the code don't

147
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,120
feel like you need understand exactly

148
00:32:37,120 --> 00:33:25,330
what's going on but the area under the

149
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,610
curve don't want your data under this

150
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,360
line you want to be anywhere near 0.5 or

151
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:47,740
lower is the most closest one is one we

152
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,890
did something very interesting from it

153
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:08,080
landed them on trees the one that we get

154
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,790
something very fast the total data
