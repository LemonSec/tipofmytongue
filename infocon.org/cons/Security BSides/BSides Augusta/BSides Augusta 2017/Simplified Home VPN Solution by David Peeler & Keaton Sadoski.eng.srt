1
00:00:38,660 --> 00:01:31,290
so so so so so so and and this is my

2
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,380
plan by to disrespect me would have

3
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,690
access reserves and it's a multi-use

4
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,600
hazard so let's say or I see these

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,220
positive thoughts on keep walking

6
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,800
Devon una so a minute so they take when

7
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,450
we go in that and they'll argue disease

8
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,810
using IDs and what they do is go this is

9
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,850
so empty however tiny places in the base

10
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,880
which is I don't want that for me so

11
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,930
when I can do to hide my traffic yeah

12
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,920
and so many more

13
00:02:24,510 --> 00:03:19,060
so so so so as well so 33 two men with

14
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,150
your lifetime to harbor admission for

15
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:34,660
sir you know those harbors are limited

16
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,930
in a Nazi tubes can travel and so your

17
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,320
bandwidth

18
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,080
[Music]

19
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,100
[Music]

20
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,420
[Music]

21
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,700
[Music]

22
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,930
[Music]

23
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,820
and also touch on the ethics concerns

24
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,190
who mentioned we're talking about your

25
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,020
Wi-Fi policy or whatever network you're

26
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,120
on because sometimes they'll set up

27
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,650
restrictions on what you're allowed to

28
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,870
do in the network and a VPN will

29
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,729
sometimes allow you to circumvent those

30
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,460
and you don't want to accidentally do

31
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,199
that so you must always be aware of what

32
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,300
network you're on and the and the

33
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,860
policies associated with that

34
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,750
so let's get into actually building one

35
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,170
we break it down to four simple steps

36
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,030
we're going to configure the pot we're

37
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,490
gonna configure our router never have to

38
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,320
install the necessary services and to

39
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,360
configure those services so let's get

40
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,420
into it

41
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,770
first off let's talk about the hardware

42
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,290
and software we're using we used a

43
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,390
Raspberry Pi model beat with raspbian

44
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,870
4.9 Raspberry Pi these are pretty cheap

45
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,300
plus they're really cool to use and

46
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,950
there as being an OS is actually

47
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,050
designed for the Raspberry Pi so it

48
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,220
comes with a lot of cold preload of

49
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,030
software that makes configuration easy

50
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,169
the three main services we're going to

51
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,290
use or open Swan and then the exhale to

52
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,710
TPD layer 2 tunneling protocol down as

53
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,660
well as PPP which is our point-to-point

54
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,760
protocol so as far as actual physical

55
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,370
limitations involved we just connected

56
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,290
the Raspberry Pi through an ethernet

57
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,050
cord to our gateways are at speeds of

58
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,880
gateway yeah

59
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,550
we chose Ethernet because it seemed more

60
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,710
reliable than Wireless plus it'll help

61
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,630
you mitigate some latency and bandwidth

62
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,900
issues run into it VPNs and of course

63
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,880
each situation to be different you can

64
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,729
use wireless for the so just keep in

65
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,770
mind you can figure in it you configure

66
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,750
the wireless interfaces so even the

67
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,390
nervous as our configurations will say

68
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,370
we use Ethernet interface so configuring

69
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,010
the pint-size we're gonna start off by a

70
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,770
segment a static IP because while

71
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,750
retaining system over out about using

72
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,510
the equally applies VPN service we don't

73
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,729
want it to often jump to different IP

74
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,090
due to the HTTP so by assigning a static

75
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,170
at peak

76
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,860
that is at least candidates make it more

77
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,610
lively

78
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,760
next up run enabled SSH raspbian is

79
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,890
really cool when it comes to this it's

80
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,210
all you have to do is drop the file into

81
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,480
SSH into the bootloader folder and a

82
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,070
handles the rest for you if you launch

83
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,680
the loop I and it has SSH already

84
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,140
initialized and lastly we're gonna

85
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,760
change the default credentials for the

86
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,910
bottom loop because if someone is

87
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,200
standing the board's when they bind

88
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,480
22news open presents age and they

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,250
guessed equal credentials and they get

90
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,040
in what good is your VPN server it's not

91
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,650
even your words all right now we're

92
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,230
gonna clear the route for something on

93
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,010
the port forward

94
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,880
I have 1701 up there for UDP although

95
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,220
that's coming with use for the layer 2

96
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,350
tunneling protocol you don't actually

97
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:34,140
need up your engine because of or T 500

98
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,830
500 mu DP that's going to your IPSec

99
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,280
protocol 20 to the screen for SSH

100
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:54,330
we're initializing SSH finally you don't

101
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,890
want to sign it static IP to the

102
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,570
Raspberry Pi the same one you had

103
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,830
assumed so they worked out I have the

104
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,980
firmware dd-wrt online runner so this is

105
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,320
what it looks like for me you may have

106
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,820
different firmware and they they're

107
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,990
different to you

108
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm not sure company do you guys have

109
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,850
for des portes before right show hands

110
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,490
and when it's for the boards yeah not

111
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,430
many people right but on the off-chance

112
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,320
that you haven't we have a resources

113
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,270
very end they'll explain how to do it

114
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,170
for most routers so open swamp all right

115
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,829
actually

116
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,000
[Music]

117
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,200
[Music]

118
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:55,640
work so so thank you

119
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,300
and it's gonna look like this the most

120
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,560
important part about this configuration

121
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,070
is you're declaring the server's IP and

122
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,740
you're going to use the wild core

123
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,870
percentile ending because and the ideal

124
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,820
situation we're using this VPN you're

125
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,920
connecting from some remote location you

126
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,930
don't know where this is going to at

127
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,110
least accept packets coming from any IP

128
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,930
as long as they're dividing PSK we chose

129
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,120
secure for example ironically that's a

130
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,370
terrible password ideally you guys would

131
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,590
be a better password purpose of an

132
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:08,660
example we have secure up there so in

133
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,460
this configuration file you're going to

134
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,200
start declaring a left and a right side

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,420
and as far as the VPNs are concerned

136
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,270
it's just a lot of designation as left

137
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,960
sides my server right sides my client so

138
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,460
left we have the same like kids before

139
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,630
from the server 2.5 - we've declared it

140
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,780
left proto port so the protocol 17 this

141
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,620
community and the for 1701 that's the

142
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,420
logic important uses within the channel

143
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,400
and one actually needs to go through the

144
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,890
router supporting right side like we did

145
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,060
before we're going to declare a

146
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,120
wild-card percentile of mini and then

147
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,180
authentication vs k and for 17/12 cord

148
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,980
anything right so here's what I've set

149
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,650
up looks like right now we have our VPN

150
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,960
server or left side and it's going to be

151
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,550
connected through an IPSec secure

152
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,290
channel your emoto's across

153
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,860
why I'm here but as of now it doesn't

154
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,270
look good because there's nothing to

155
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,520
populate that channel your days to be

156
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,210
disorganized put a lien correctly right

157
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,140
so we're gonna add Excel to PPD that's

158
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,529
where to tell my protocol team this by

159
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,830
itself would work to provide any

160
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:34,860
confidentiality in the encryption so

161
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,450
when you're configuring this service

162
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,270
we're gonna find out under the / XE / x

163
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:45,060
l2tp d /x l2 BDD comp and the important

164
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,860
part about this configuration is going

165
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,570
to declare the pool of IPs

166
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,060
that's been Viviana these are physical

167
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,790
literal like B's but there are lots the

168
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,839
ones that keeps up with ins

169
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,810
configurations and then very prominent

170
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,360
speakers it's gonna require chop

171
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,920
that's a challenge handshake

172
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,200
authentication protocol that's we're

173
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,390
gonna set up profiles of a username

174
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,990
password combination if you separate

175
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,850
different users on your VPN PPP which

176
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,640
hold the bottle can chat rightz if you

177
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,260
have different people used to be and not

178
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,600
just a sub let's say your wife or

179
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,570
coworkers you're gonna have to run user

180
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,220
password they're gonna have their

181
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,270
username password really well not

182
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,050
unfortunately if someone were to

183
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,850
shoulder surgery or get ahold of

184
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,980
username password they would not have

185
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,950
the authentication of your other groups

186
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,810
on the VPN so this has another layer to

187
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,250
your VPN security so PPP which is going

188
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,690
to provide to chat up an occasion

189
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,600
there's going to be figured under /p p /

190
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,910
options dot excel - PD and most of these

191
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,320
are the default options for PvP but most

192
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,300
importantly you'll see the MTU in our

193
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,160
University

194
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,750
you know funner that's your max

195
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,639
transmission unit and your backs

196
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,389
receiving you normally it'll be 1500 but

197
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,889
in this instance because we're adding so

198
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,720
many different arrows on you want to

199
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,519
make sure it's smaller so you have a

200
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
little bit more Headroom otherwise if it

201
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,819
goes over the maximum private size of a

202
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:21,230
Ethernet packet still fragment and

203
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,879
you're not gonna want that so we said

204
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,069
that the 12 pointer so right now it

205
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:30,529
looks like dupioni looks like as you're

206
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,050
people beautiful files on it there's an

207
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,899
IPSec secure channel document you your

208
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,629
answer in your photos and then within it

209
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,459
it's populated by several different data

210
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,939
streams I ain't even funds that all goes

211
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,519
over to win securely connect immune from

212
00:15:46,519 --> 00:16:13,250
whatever you are - so we just want to

213
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,350
give a special thanks to our teacher

214
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,509
Wendy Patrick she's also our seventh

215
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,300
Patriot coach she's a fantastic and and

216
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,120
I mentor mr. Matt Danko for helping us

217
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,790
get through this we recognize for high

218
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,350
school students and we're new to this

219
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,329
field so if we didn't explain anything

220
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,029
correctly or team just in the extra

221
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,279
clarification what we men doing any

222
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:42,279
questions back up to the resources

223
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,990
any other questions or things you sure

224
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,160
well assuming you're not all streaming

225
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,410
at the same time it does pretty well for

226
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,099
providing web pages multiple sources it

227
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,020
does get a little bogged down and we

228
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,089
start streaming just because a Raspberry

229
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,240
Pi isn't as powerful as so popular but

230
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
it is still pretty powerful so you can

231
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:25,140
get by with just web pages yeah so when

232
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,420
you're configuring that the left side on

233
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,700
the VPN configuration will be the VPN

234
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,500
server the right side is the remote

235
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,690
client however if you were to set this

236
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,990
up on a Linux distro on a remote client

237
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,330
the left side would be the client on the

238
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,040
right side of the server so left icon

239
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,930
refers to yourself and the right side is

240
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:50,430
where you'll be nekked into excuse me

241
00:17:50,430 --> 00:18:00,150
oh that's all handled by the IV set and

242
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,530
the left side and right side leave word

243
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,150
figured by the two GD o the left the

244
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,590
right side were configured by the L to

245
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,140
TBD whereas IPSec phase one phase two

246
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,700
were handled in the opposite

247
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:18,600
configurations many more questions all

248
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,190
right so we got some prize to the

249
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,020
handout recognized are probably the

250
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,150
speakers here we have a couple more

251
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,280
Millenial questions first question first

252
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,390
person answer will get a lockpick set

253
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,500
I've heard that these are illegal in

254
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:45,030
state of Virginia so yeah so what social

255
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,380
media recently released a geomap feature

256
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,540
that will show your current okay

257
00:18:51,540 --> 00:19:04,140
snapchat has that guy alright for our

258
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,940
next question we are giving now a land

259
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,720
turtle drop shelves anywhere push

260
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,240
through the which ports did we forward

261
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:41,070
for IPSec there you go all right this is

262
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,060
the first hand as he go up

263
00:19:44,060 --> 00:20:01,170
what was our terrible password hands up

264
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:22,770
which service handled the profiles all

265
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,660
right this is the blue team handbook

266
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,270
incident response Edition a condensing

267
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,320
little guy for the cyber security

268
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,990
instant responder the question of this

269
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,310
and it's calling you if is what was the

270
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,740
other option other than IPSec recursion

271
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,720
that we gave guns back back right blue

272
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,930
shirt

273
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,660
well thank you for your time

274
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,059
[Applause]
