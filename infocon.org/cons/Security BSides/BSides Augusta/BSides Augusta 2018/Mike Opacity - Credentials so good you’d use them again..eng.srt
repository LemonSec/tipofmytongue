1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,140
so today's discussion is on credential

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,700
replay attacks it's also known as cred

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,010
stuffing and we're going to go through

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,180
some technical deal there's two

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,430
perspectives to this talk one is from

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,980
the end-user perspective where you know

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,770
how can you understand what's going on

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,509
with a credit replay attack and the

9
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:32,700
others from a service provider

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,290
perspective which is I'm being hit with

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,210
one how do I actually see it what are

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,350
the countermeasures I can actually

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,280
deploy against it so this is our agenda

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,590
you can tell I work for DoD at one point

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,410
in time yet so this is obviously not

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,530
just my presentation I want to work with

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,190
a group of fantastic professionals and

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,499
let's see three of them are up there

19
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:07,360
warm ones in the room this is me

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,510
I started out 2006 doing security as my

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,790
full-time job did it for 10 years in the

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,880
DoD another a year and a half in the

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,380
intelligence community kind of

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,200
intelligence community and then the last

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,820
two and a half years in a global

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,780
financial responsible for detection and

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,970
response for cyber and fraud and that's

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,560
where we first observed this particular

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,420
activity so what is it

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,650
it's the exploitation of credential

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,330
pairs usernames and passwords recovered

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,940
from breaches and they're aggregated

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,990
then they're fired against other

34
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,240
platforms and they take advantage of the

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,880
fact that end users myself included are

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,090
lazy we reuse usernames we reuse

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,060
passwords on multiple sites those sites

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,190
get breached and once they're breached

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,260
they're harvested they're loaded into

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,080
tools and they're shot against any

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,780
internet facing portal to see whether or

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,370
not that username and password pair was

43
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,160
used again so hackers account for 90% of

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,340
the login attempts at online retailers

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,810
interesting stat 91% ecommerce 60%

46
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,470
airline so most of the login traffic

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,030
that is going across the internet is

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,760
fraud or attempted fraud

49
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,200
where's it coming from again it's coming

50
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,930
from breaches 1.5 billion credits came

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,450
out of Yahoo Adult Friend Finder is

52
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,940
responsible for another half billion

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,050
myspace every time you see one of these

54
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,630
breaches that occurs where username and

55
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,150
password pairs are compromised those

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,770
username and password pairs are being

57
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,360
reused for credential replay attacks why

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,750
does it work well our account defense is

59
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,489
primarily to stop brute-force right I

60
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,709
tried same username password three times

61
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,959
and that password locks out with this

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,910
type of attack you use that you use the

63
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,400
credential one time it either works or

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,440
it doesn't and you move on so one IP

65
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,959
address can test as many credentials as

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,090
it likes until you either shut down that

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,209
IP or do something with the traffic and

68
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,470
fundamentally again it's an attack on

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,569
your authentication system not your

70
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,580
actual product the credentials are

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,739
tested and the response is what's being

72
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,360
recorded so these guys aren't rolling

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,970
into the product they are simply using

74
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,100
your authentication system to bounce

75
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,230
creds off of and they're monitoring what

76
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,540
the response looks like we're gonna see

77
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,549
us some examples here shortly okay

78
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,640
so this is the most common this is a

79
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,790
failure and what you see here as you see

80
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,579
a login attempt in the request URL you

81
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,090
see a 302 found redirect and then on the

82
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,709
bottom you see it's going to a bad

83
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,530
password so this is the case where a

84
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,780
credential was presented it was not the

85
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,209
proper match so it sends you to hey did

86
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,500
you forget your password you want to try

87
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,609
it you know do you want to try forget

88
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,160
flow so that is the most likely response

89
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,959
this is us other kind of response this

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,940
is the credential was valid but the

91
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,640
accounts not so in here again you see

92
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,100
the 302 redirect going back down to site

93
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,180
minor and sending him somewhere but this

94
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,260
is the problem so this is again goes to

95
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,440
login but on the bottom you'll see that

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,020
they're going right to the portal so in

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,260
this case this credential is valid it's

98
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,530
good for an employee or for whatever the

99
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,580
accounts good for

100
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,970
and it's going to be recorded and then

101
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,069
it is going to be reused later to commit

102
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,960
whatever kind of fraud can be done with

103
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,609
that portal let us being tested against

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,370
so what do they get out of it how is it

105
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,909
done

106
00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:00,860
if you are a business that's front

107
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,440
facing on the Internet you're selling

108
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
something you're giving away miles for

109
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,120
for travel you're giving away points for

110
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,639
hotels you've got a game company that's

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,440
got you know some kind of gold or

112
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,520
whatever in the game you've got

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,159
something of value that you are selling

114
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,500
or accessing on the Internet and what

115
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,970
they are doing is they're taking over

116
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,610
the accounts of your users and then

117
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,130
either exploiting them basically they're

118
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,960
either using them to generate month for

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,300
money redirect money they're using them

120
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,740
to take points using them to take miles

121
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,500
and it's it's very straightforward easy

122
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,940
there's a couple of end-user stories

123
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,310
here this happened to me last year woke

124
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,889
up in the morning my phone tells me

125
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,379
welcome to Comcast Wireless what the

126
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,849
hell happened I didn't order comcast

127
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,259
Wireless my new iPhones on the way

128
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,569
though so I called and I got it all

129
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,870
stopped next day comes wake up welcome

130
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,300
to Comcast Wireless call the fraud

131
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,560
department talk to him again

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,750
this time the guy tells me they're using

133
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,490
the comp your Comcast email account I

134
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,500
never used a Comcast email account but I

135
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,069
got one when I signed up for Comcast

136
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,770
Internet and I had to log into it once

137
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,560
and I set a password for it and I used

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,210
one that was exposed actually in the

139
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,880
LinkedIn breach so what they did is they

140
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,360
threw creds against from the LinkedIn

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,150
breach against the Comcast portal

142
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,190
username password pair matched and they

143
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,710
used that account to order service they

144
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,620
also used a fraud a stolen credit card

145
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,259
to pay for it so it wasn't all that bad

146
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:36,650
not for me so okay that's how it looks

147
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,110
as an individual level but how do you

148
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,060
really do this right how do you really

149
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,430
take this and take it to the next level

150
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,500
and exploit it for a lot of money you

151
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,569
know what if I go after a bank I don't

152
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,180
how do I do that well I do that with if

153
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,889
you ever go to Walmart and you see those

154
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,020
visa master cards that are hanging

155
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,060
the j-hook set the exit you know when

156
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,790
you go through the register so those

157
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,880
things can be activated and they can be

158
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,980
actually accessed in the automatic

159
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,510
transaction Network of the banking

160
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,450
system so once I have that card I

161
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,510
activate it with a stolen identity

162
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,330
because why not then that card has an

163
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,180
ABA DDI pair to it at any place I go to

164
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,550
if I take over an account I can change

165
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,380
any financial any money that's being

166
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,000
moved to go to my fraud card and that is

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,410
the way that's the way we see a lot of

168
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,840
fraud being done in the space it works

169
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,370
it works at scale so what can you do how

170
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,960
do you limit the effectiveness of this

171
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,730
particular technique how do you stop it

172
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,160
now as a service provider so the first

173
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,560
thing you have to look at your logins

174
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,140
you have to look at login failures creds

175
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,270
stuffing is easy to spot if you're

176
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,310
looking at your traffic 99% fail anybody

177
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,960
who's logging in from an IP address

178
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,180
hundreds and thousands of times just I

179
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,940
have to do it to make any kind of a

180
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,860
again they're gonna be ninety-nine

181
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,780
percent failure from that IP address so

182
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,860
they're gonna stand out if you're

183
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,850
looking second thing know your customers

184
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,270
are coming from if they're coming from

185
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,460
coalos virtual privates hosting of

186
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,160
arrangements cloud servers that's not

187
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,080
where most people come from that's where

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,600
service providers live but it is where

189
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,370
criminals and fraud networks come from

190
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,350
that service they can easily buy and

191
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,970
when it gets knocked down they don't

192
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,270
care they just move on to the next

193
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,190
second metrics matter know what right

194
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,870
looks like in your platform understand

195
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,909
and when you start seeing changes when

196
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,610
you see your your failed login go from

197
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,280
you know twenty thousand an hour to a

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,960
hundred and fifty thousand an hour ask

199
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,290
questions and baseline your transactions

200
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,010
um look at your login services let me

201
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,170
see I think I've got a picture next yeah

202
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,290
I do so this is kind of hard to see it's

203
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,960
a lot easier on the laptop apologies but

204
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,580
um if you look down on the right side

205
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,630
the failure rates 0.99 eight point nine

206
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,880
nine six point nine nine six this is

207
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,830
all credit stuffing this is all replay

208
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,660
this is not real this is somebody trying

209
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,540
to take over accounts they're running

210
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,030
almost 2500 accounts for four good

211
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,500
logins alright so this actually is very

212
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,840
easy to spot if you're looking for it

213
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,700
and you can't hide behind eyepiece

214
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,470
because the actual behavior is what

215
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,210
you're looking at so we're gonna talk a

216
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,770
little bit about tools that automate a

217
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,170
lot of this but on the receiving side if

218
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,730
you're paying attention it's still easy

219
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,150
to spot

220
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,260
all right mitigation if I have a 99.9

221
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,720
percent failure rate the only way I can

222
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,610
accomplish something that I can generate

223
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,670
revenue off of is automation so the way

224
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,830
to defeat this type of attack is to

225
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,040
defeat defeat automation as it presents

226
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,650
itself to your login portal okay it's

227
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,270
not a human behind the keyboard it's a

228
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,410
script so if you can do that then you

229
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,120
can and disconnect those sessions not

230
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,190
even let them start that mitigates it

231
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,940
Akamai does that shape does that we

232
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,300
actually ran a homegrown solution for

233
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,080
awhile which was a it was a work of art

234
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,970
it was not my work it was sylvia's work

235
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,720
and what we did is we watched for login

236
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,730
accepts where somebody actually got a

237
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,470
password into the portal and then

238
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,030
process that account immediately for a

239
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,310
password reset the guy was doing me a

240
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,910
favor okay I had breach credentials that

241
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,770
were out there everyone that was

242
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,030
breached was getting a password reset

243
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,360
thanks to him so you can't actually use

244
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,910
them as a service on the end user side

245
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,440
take a look at have I been pwned or any

246
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
of the other sites that actually track

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,760
credential exposure in the wild if you

248
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,320
see that you've been popped and if

249
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,610
you've been around this place for a

250
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,840
little while the answer is going to be

251
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,120
yeah you've been popped you know some of

252
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,470
your account information has gotten out

253
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,890
there

254
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,170
don't use that password again ever

255
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,500
anywhere and make sure that if you're

256
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,690
tying a username and password to

257
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,340
something that has financial information

258
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,470
behind it it's different from any of the

259
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,990
other passwords you use so that's the

260
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,520
easiest way to avoid it it's the easiest

261
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,740
way from an end-user perspective

262
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,360
to not expose yourself to that problem

263
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,040
one of the easiest tools on the Internet

264
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,900
to do this type of attack is something

265
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,500
called sentry MBA and if you can't

266
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,150
configure itself don't worry that dark

267
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,290
web will help you this is what it looks

268
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,470
like so what it basically will do is it

269
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,840
will go out it will go to the website

270
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,420
you want to cred stuff and then it will

271
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,070
set up the pro it'll read it and it will

272
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,640
set you up set up some options for you

273
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,400
then you can take a look at what the the

274
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,750
request header looks like and you can

275
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,120
select your user agents this is an

276
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,550
attempt to make it hard to see because

277
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,590
the user agents are gonna vary because

278
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,170
it's only the same four user agents it

279
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,729
works you can still see them very easily

280
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,840
this is a for sale this came off on the

281
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,120
came off the dark web with credentials

282
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
that were a credential configuration

283
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,700
preset to go out of institution they all

284
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,140
you do is pay your money and they send

285
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,700
you the they sent they send it to you

286
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,890
use your own creds lather rinse repeat

287
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,920
you're in business

288
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,890
so my takeaways for you look at your

289
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,800
logins if you have less than 1% success

290
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
from an IP address its a replay attack

291
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,810
to stop it to feed automation there are

292
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,570
commercial products you can do it inside

293
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,060
but this is actually a big deal account

294
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,400
takeover is a significant problem in any

295
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,470
anywhere that you're relying on a

296
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,030
username and password to defend

297
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,160
somebody's account for your users

298
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,260
obviously don't reuse especially when

299
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,210
you have money at risk and if a password

300
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,070
is discovered in a breach please don't

301
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,310
use it again and now comes the fun part

302
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,160
of the briefing your questions ma'am

303
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:19,620
yes so when this attack works they login

304
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,160
as you so the question really is what

305
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
can you do on this portal so let's say

306
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,130
they got my Amazon account and my Amazon

307
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,140
account has a Visa card that's already

308
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,180
associated with it well they can go

309
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,450
shopping at ship you know whatever they

310
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,209
want to do if they get into my bank

311
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,500
they're in there as me they can change

312
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,320
where my direct deposit information goes

313
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,550
so anything that you can do on that

314
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,529
internet internet facing portal they can

315
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,240
do because they actually appear as you

316
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,790
in the in the portal sure yes sir

317
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,430
so all those methods work sir and what

318
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,410
the the problem that you run into is as

319
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,470
you put in mitigations the better actors

320
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,090
are going to retool and they're gonna

321
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,530
come at you with something else so it's

322
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,570
not something that you just you you you

323
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,150
you solve it and it goes away so they

324
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,940
retool they come back at you you change

325
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,920
your strategy sometimes the capture

326
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,750
works just well sometimes putting Akamai

327
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,880
in front works just fine sometimes you

328
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,320
go with shape sometimes a homegrown

329
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,710
solution but until you see that failure

330
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,810
rate that bulk failure rate go down that

331
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,180
means you've now made your your your

332
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,970
portal is now more difficult to use than

333
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,010
the guy down the street and that in the

334
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,420
end of the day that's all we can do is

335
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,590
we can move them down the street to try

336
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,610
to go after somebody else

337
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,410
so I didn't talk about that but uh

338
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,110
there's an entire fraud Network that's

339
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,780
dedicated to moving product moving

340
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,720
technology and moving money so once you

341
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,240
have access to somebody's account you

342
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,670
need to monetize that access so how you

343
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,650
take product out how you take money out

344
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,750
where you send it to and then how you

345
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,820
get it to the second third destination

346
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,560
so that recovery is difficult or

347
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,350
impossible is all part of the fraud you

348
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,150
have from from their side you will see

349
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,400
everything from idiots to sophisticated

350
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,800
nation-state criminals you know

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,330
organized crime the more dedicated

352
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,920
people will be added for months if not

353
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:49,230
years so I can tell you that we use

354
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,710
shape it works very well it's a

355
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,790
JavaScript injection the idea is simply

356
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,290
to make sure that it's a human beside

357
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,690
behind the keyboard but even that is

358
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,270
something that's it's not a one-time fix

359
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,940
it's something that we work with

360
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,100
continuously because there's money at

361
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,200
stake there's money at risk and the

362
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,320
actor if they've been successful at some

363
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,839
point in time they know if they adjust a

364
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,339
little bit they can make it successful

365
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,200
again so they're constantly coming at

366
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,790
you yes sir

367
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm sorry sorry I I am I am not off top

368
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,589
of my head

369
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,910
I apologize I have some I have some

370
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,710
giveaways up here too so whoever asked

371
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,070
the we got questions so if anybody has

372
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,450
any other questions we'll combine it

373
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,190
with a giveaway that way we get rid of

374
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,490
books and stuff sir

375
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,649
so that's a really interesting point

376
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,959
it's a great question so if you know

377
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,330
where your customers are you can

378
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,609
understand where geographically you

379
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,020
would expect to see them and where you

380
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,939
would not expect to see them that being

381
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,609
said there's a lot of VPN services out

382
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:14,220
there so you could easily be in elbonia

383
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,650
or some other some other location on the

384
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,390
globe and appear to be coming from New

385
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,250
Jersey sir

386
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,470
they are unique to a credit stuffing

387
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,169
tool they can be legitimate when you see

388
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,450
century MBA you'll see the same four six

389
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,000
browser browser user agents repeated

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,720
over and over again but if it's a you

391
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,980
know if it's a smart actor it'll be

392
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,080
legit so you sir have your choice of I

393
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,779
got the blue team incident response sock

394
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,809
and sim I've got a lockpick set and then

395
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,210
looks like a nice wide range wireless

396
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,250
adapter wireless adapter for the win yes

397
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,520
sir your choice of the ballas blue team

398
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,990
which one I got incident response and

399
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:18,360
sim there we go yes sir yes sir

400
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,020
there's no visibility of this at all in

401
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,590
fact they find out when they get the

402
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,000
bill they find out when their money is

403
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,380
missing they find out when they get

404
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,669
upset six months 30 days depends on the

405
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:39,940
nature of the breach the problem is that

406
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,890
the crime sometimes it's too small in

407
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,460
scope to get many people involved from

408
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,200
it's like if I can steal $20 from a

409
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,789
hundred thousand people I'm happy but

410
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,039
how hard is that to build a case against

411
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,590
and that we see a lot of your choices of

412
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,679
lockpicks or absolutely good for you yes

413
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,890
ma'am

414
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,500
right

415
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,860
mm-hm

416
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,850
Windows is actually doing that now there

417
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,280
if it has a if it's made its credential

418
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,680
you know bad credential list it does

419
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,910
more that could you pass the please

420
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:39,050
thank you but it's hard to to work from

421
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,110
that end of the business the best answer

422
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,240
is to factor the best answer is some

423
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,460
other way to break that that

424
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,680
communication for the for the actor and

425
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,870
we are we are at time so if you have to

426
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,430
leave or want to leave that's absolutely

427
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,320
fine if you want to hang out that's fine

428
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,620
as well

429
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:08,228
[Applause]
