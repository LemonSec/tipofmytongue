1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,060
and my name is Ray Davidson I've sort of

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,189
been doing security and computer stuff

3
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,150
since since they were invented I went to

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,700
Georgia Tech for my undergraduate school

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,079
go jackets

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,840
to hell with Georgia and I went to

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,980
Purdue for my graduate degree in

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,019
chemical engineering there was no you

9
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:38,910
know we used we actually used computers

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,570
back then and I wrote my PhD thesis in

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,309
word processor that you probably don't

12
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,250
know it's called VI so that was because

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,619
I had to have my Master's typed on a

14
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,979
typewriter so so I've been around for a

15
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,290
little while I was the I taught at

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,180
Purdue a regional campus at Purdue for a

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,699
little while any of you have heard of

18
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,799
sans one of the sponsors of this this

19
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,449
event I was the Dean of the Graduate

20
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,630
School there right now I'm a contractor

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,580
for the state of Michigan the great

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,799
state of Michigan of which you all have

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,040
a map in your built into your body

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,020
almost you know except if you've had an

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,600
accident but I live in Kalamazoo

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,300
Michigan which is right here on your map

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,580
it's halfway between Chicago and Detroit

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,430
and I worked for the state of Michigan

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm going to tell you a little bit about

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,810
the Michigan cyber civilian Corps and

31
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,810
because of the timing of this I Georgia

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,300
gets it do you get a new governor this

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,040
year okay is he like term limited or you

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,180
just don't like him see what he's

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,760
already had - okay so same same in

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,880
Michigan Rick Snyder is not going to be

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,890
our governor anymore the Michigan cyber

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,440
civilian Corps has been a project of his

39
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
and I've been leading it for the past

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,190
couple of years and we're gonna get a

41
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,320
new governor so I'm doing what I can to

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
get outside of Michigan to talk about

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,158
the Michigan cyber civilian course so

44
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:10,139
you'll all think it's cool and you'll go

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,260
to the new Michigan governor and say can

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,760
you come tell us about this well I will

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,280
still have a job next year so this is

48
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,810
all selfish so the Michigan cyber

49
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,129
civilian Corps is it was conceived in

50
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,569
2011

51
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,840
as a group and this is I believe this is

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,849
the official wording a group of trained

53
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,950
cyber security experts who volunteered

54
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,499
to assist the state in rapid resolution

55
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:39,060
of officially declared cyber of

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,019
urgencies does anybody not buy into that

57
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,189
anybody think that's not a cool idea

58
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,980
right nobody's gonna vote against that

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,799
it sounds cool

60
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,829
this six years later we now have the

61
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,750
Michigan cyber civilian Act and I'm not

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,790
complaining that it took this long this

63
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,680
is how long it takes to do stuff like

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,919
this we actually went from getting it

65
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,659
introduced in the legislature to getting

66
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,639
it passed in the legislature in in the

67
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,530
course of about ten months which is

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,159
pretty pretty good and so it is a work

69
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,930
in progress and I'll tell you about it

70
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,790
and I'll tell you about what I really

71
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,370
want to share some of the some of the

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,780
experiences some of the lessons learned

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,810
that we all do lessons learned right

74
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,500
after every incident okay so not but I'm

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,389
trying to do lessons learned so I'm

76
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,949
trying to spread this idea when I I

77
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,739
haven't I've been doing this since 2000

78
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,060
fifteen or sixteen I don't remember

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,530
exactly when but so when I went to look

80
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,359
at for history I had to do open source

81
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,569
intelligence gathering and I found in

82
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,879
2013 there is a YouTube video of

83
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,430
Governor Rick Snyder talking at the

84
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,500
North American International cyber

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,169
summit which happens every year or has

86
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,849
happened every year under Governor Rick

87
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,180
Snyder it's held in Detroit and Detroit

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,609
I don't if you've never been to Michigan

89
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,930
Detroit is on the border of the United

90
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,729
States and if you look across the lake

91
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,209
you can see Windsor Ontario and so it's

92
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,219
an international cyber conference

93
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,750
because I think people drive across the

94
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,509
bridge to come come to it so the North

95
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,279
American international cyber summit in

96
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,228
2013 he announced we were going to have

97
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,839
a cyber civility core and he sort of had

98
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,580
a vague idea about what it was going to

99
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,740
be and it was probably the language you

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,680
see here experts who volunteered to

101
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,740
assist the state and officially declared

102
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,580
cyber emergencies blah blah blah it was

103
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,500
formed it started off as a partnership

104
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,770
between the state of Michigan merit

105
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,470
merit is a nonprofit organization in in

106
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,150
Michigan that was one of the original

107
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,310
providers of Internet service in the

108
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,919
country they they they believed they

109
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,360
provided it to Purdue when I was in

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,400
graduate school many many many years ago

111
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,629
they were part of the North American

112
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:59,099
network operating group and they at the

113
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,569
time of this we're trying to get more

114
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,430
into cyber security so they volunteered

115
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,000
to the governor to take on the role of

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,379
building this cyber civility Corps they

117
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,050
also have a cyber range that they're

118
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,530
they're working on in 2015 for various

119
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,680
reasons the state of Michigan decided to

120
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,590
take this back under its own wing and as

121
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,440
it happened we had not a politician or

122
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,800
not a what do you call the people that

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,020
always work for the government you know

124
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,810
there wasn't a bureaucrat or technocrat

125
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,319
it was the our CSO whose name is Dan

126
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,849
Morman and you may see he writes for

127
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:39,750
security magazines and things like that

128
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,580
now he's a consultant but he quit

129
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,610
working for the state of Michigan and

130
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,870
consumers energy which is one of the

131
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,060
major utility companies in Michigan

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,389
loaned the state one of their executives

133
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,449
to be the seaso for a year

134
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,150
this guy was also at the time a member

135
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,250
of mi C 3 the michigan cyber civilian

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,009
core and so he took some of his feelings

137
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,659
about the mi c 3 and what does she be

138
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:03,960
doing

139
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,630
into the role of the corporate

140
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,550
information security officer or chief

141
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,199
information support ever it stands for

142
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,169
for the stake and he did some things and

143
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,050
i'll talk about that and then he that

144
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,529
was temporary and now I'm the no I'm the

145
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:24,569
big guy the guy to blame in last year I

146
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,870
gotta watch my time the governor set the

147
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,000
goal of expanding mi c3 to 200 members

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,509
and we back we we backed off on that a

149
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,759
little bit because if you're gonna have

150
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,050
200 members you have to have some other

151
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,909
things we have a hundred members on the

152
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,159
roster now it's just pretty cool and

153
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,380
I'll tell you more about that so this is

154
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,630
a picture it's a picture a lot of the

155
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,979
people in here are members of the

156
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,680
Michigan cyber civilian Corps I'm even

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,180
hiding in there somewhere

158
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,439
probably on the back row I try to stay

159
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,810
out of sight but we do it you could see

160
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,819
we do have a few females not not enough

161
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,310
we have we do partner with the Michigan

162
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,229
State Police and the Michigan National

163
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,749
Guard we have air guard and army guard

164
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:17,469
in Michigan and I'll talk a little bit

165
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,419
more about that but I that that

166
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,009
partnership is awesome

167
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,749
because we're all civilians we're not

168
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,069
cleared

169
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,710
we're not sworn nothing like that so

170
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,060
that gives us advantages and

171
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,580
disadvantages but we have people in

172
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,039
uniforms and with guns and things if we

173
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,169
need them I mean not that we need guns

174
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:41,080
but if we need official help so you all

175
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,629
see how pretty these people are and it

176
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,159
makes you want to be one right this

177
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,469
picture was taken at the mc3 not the mi

178
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,009
c3 you run out of acronyms right so we

179
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,860
are the mi c3 in the MC 3 which is the

180
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,750
Michigan cyber command center this is

181
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,529
the State Police's cyber command center

182
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,939
kind of like the in kick if you've ever

183
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,210
been the end kick so now that you're all

184
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,789
thinking I wish I lived in Michigan and

185
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,379
I could be a member of the Michigan

186
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,659
cyber civilian Corps what would I have

187
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,529
to do to be a member of this August

188
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,060
organization you have to have two years

189
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,159
of information security incident

190
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,899
response to digital or network forensics

191
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,449
so we're not hiring beginners we're not

192
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,219
direct training people we want people

193
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,009
that can there already know how to

194
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,569
respond in the event of a declared cyber

195
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,339
emergency remember that phrase we'll

196
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:35,799
talk about that you have to have one

197
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,169
foundational security certification now

198
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,809
I'm not going to go into the arguments

199
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,089
about certification okay we can I know

200
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,949
they're all right but I have to put a

201
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:50,860
bar you know I have to put some bar I

202
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,410
can't take just everybody so and I said

203
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,899
it you know security plus ethical hacker

204
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,110
cissp or any any GX cert and if somebody

205
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,600
comes in and says I think we probably

206
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,180
have let people with with Cisco CCNA or

207
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,699
CCNP on basically you have but you have

208
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:07,750
to know what you're doing you have to

209
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,510
type of the command line we asked for

210
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,760
employer support for up to 10 days of

211
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
participation and the way that works out

212
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,370
is on the fourth bullet point we we have

213
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,560
for the past three years done five or

214
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,290
six days of training we do one or two

215
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,960
one-day exercises maybe on a Saturday

216
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,480
where we ask people to to leave their

217
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,930
home

218
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,000
Michigan remember it's a it's a big

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,920
State there's even though there's an

220
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,260
Upper Peninsula to that I'm not gonna

221
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,840
try and you know and shadow-puppet but

222
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,550
if you look up on Wikipedia you can see

223
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,350
how how Michigan is and we have three

224
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,770
members I think in the Upper Peninsula

225
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,200
up there where the snow we have half of

226
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,560
the Upper Peninsula on the M I see three

227
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,760
there's more than six people it's like

228
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,740
New Zealand right has more sheep than

229
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,770
people we have I think the U P the Upper

230
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,060
Peninsula has more mosquitoes than

231
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,050
people so we do one or two exercises and

232
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,670
we encourage people to do community

233
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,530
volunteering any members of cyber

234
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,930
anybody work with CyberPatriot here

235
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,600
oh isn't that an awesome program just

236
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,490
just say yes because you know and

237
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,490
because it's defensive I love it it's

238
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,570
not just breaking stuff so this is the

239
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,550
the participation we asked for we asked

240
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,190
for employers to say you can be gone for

241
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,260
ten days but after all we're giving them

242
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,110
five days of training so you know I

243
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,330
haven't had to had haven't had to have

244
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,200
that discussion with employers yeah so

245
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,350
this is the the process this is the

246
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,690
process that actually was started by by

247
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,450
merit we've tweaked it a little bit

248
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,550
don't know can you read that as much as

249
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,950
you want to it'll be on YouTube but

250
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,660
basically that's the website if you're

251
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,460
bored and you want a google and you

252
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,200
trust the Wi-Fi here and you want to go

253
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,770
to mi cybercorps org it's cybercorps not

254
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,730
cyber corpse

255
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,330
even those an S because corpse means a

256
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,050
dead body and it has an e on the end so

257
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,330
it's cyber courts pronounced core just

258
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,390
like the Marine Corps but anyway so you

259
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,890
go and you register you give us your

260
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,390
name address phone number credit card

261
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,880
information a lock of your hair on the

262
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,940
website and that's that's all it happens

263
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,760
there you register and we

264
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,390
send you a link to the first test and

265
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,590
that was a requirement I don't think

266
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,840
that goes in here right I didn't have

267
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,600
applicants must pass four out of five

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,490
tests also should be the last bullet

269
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,060
point so the first test is a basic

270
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,890
security it's pretty much ports and

271
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,650
protocols is ten sorry 20 questions ten

272
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,650
minutes to take the test so it's not

273
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,200
like giuk you can't it's not open book

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,670
stuff you have to know off the top of

275
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,430
your head I believe you have to get 80 I

276
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,800
don't remember what I said it at if you

277
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,890
pass the basic security test you then

278
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,900
get a congratulations email that says

279
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,060
here are your next two tests and there's

280
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,600
a basic ir and a basic forensics it's

281
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,380
mostly disk forensics tests and if you

282
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,450
pass if you pass the basic forensics

283
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,280
test you get a congratulations email

284
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,260
that says here's the advanced forensics

285
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,210
test and if you pass the basic ir test

286
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,470
you get an email that says

287
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,500
congratulations here's the advanced ir

288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,230
test take it and you have to you have to

289
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,530
pass four of the five and there is one

290
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,170
that most people don't pad like I'm not

291
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,230
surprised when people don't pass it but

292
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,170
so anyway most people I think we've got

293
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,660
probably an unjust ballparking this I I

294
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,090
could have gotten the data I'm guessing

295
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,670
we get like a 50 percent pass rate of

296
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,670
all four tests so 50 percent of the

297
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,910
people that try pass the test and that's

298
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,980
not counting the one guy that tried to

299
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,560
brute force the exams and took it seven

300
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,320
times I can see that but you know we

301
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,390
have it we have us of web application

302
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,660
let's we see that so once once they pass

303
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,290
four of the five tests they send we send

304
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,940
another congratulations email that

305
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,010
actually as human has human intervention

306
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,780
I have to do it because I have to send

307
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,350
copies of the the volunteer agreement

308
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,820
which includes a confidential disclosure

309
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,080
agree or an NDA that was written by our

310
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,190
Attorney General and the employer

311
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,020
agreement we don't act we don't require

312
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,060
the employer agreement because it's not

313
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,460
a legally binding thing if we we have an

314
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,529
emergency and Ford Motor Company

315
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,870
want to release their they are MSE three

316
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,850
members there's nothing we can do you

317
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,620
know I can't go sue for it or anything

318
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,290
like that but it's but but we believe we

319
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,389
provide enough of a value that employers

320
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,449
are going to do that we do a criminal

321
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:53,249
background check talk to that once this

322
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,110
is after it completes the criminal

323
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,550
background check I've got a I've got to

324
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,749
change that because the criminal

325
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:59,660
background check is a black box to us

326
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,069
basically once I submit that to the

327
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,610
State Police

328
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,120
I order a michigan.gov email account and

329
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,620
if they don't pass we do something on

330
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,240
the back end but it's it's unusual for

331
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,209
people not to pass it's not unheard of

332
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,279
though if you ever have to have a

333
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,350
criminal background check be aware that

334
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,999
it goes into things that have gotten

335
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,860
expunged from your record if you did

336
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,079
something stupid in high school it's

337
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,209
gonna it's gonna bite you so that said I

338
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,829
I know I have friends that worked in

339
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:31,319
state police who wanted to hire a guy

340
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,480
who had excellent forensic skills and I

341
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,430
have no idea I don't want to know what

342
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,379
he did when he was a kid but they can't

343
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:41,300
hire him because of this so anyway

344
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,910
currently we are as far as I know the

345
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,040
only state-sponsored all-volunteer force

346
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,839
of cyber defenders if anybody knows was

347
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,240
somebody else please talk to me because

348
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,410
I'd love to collaborate with them

349
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,790
because we're making mistakes all our

350
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,189
own right now and I do have other states

351
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,050
asking about this I've been we had

352
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,230
Montana we had Hawaii come visit us we

353
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,029
wanted to go visit them but I couldn't

354
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,730
get you know couldn't swing that Indiana

355
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,730
Wisconsin like up in the Midwest region

356
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,100
FEMA Region five we have a lot of people

357
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,939
half the people meet DOD directive 8570

358
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,350
which i guess has been replaced by

359
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,970
something at something else and this is

360
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,220
not all that cool except that in

361
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,839
Michigan I get to say half our members

362
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,319
of milspec so assuming we have members

363
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,939
what do we actually do the Michigan has

364
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:35,429
a cyber disruption response plan which

365
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:37,649
is in the event of a cyber emergency

366
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,019
what's going to happen and it puts into

367
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,790
place an operating environment emergency

368
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,230
operations are led by a member

369
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,750
of the state police so in the event of a

370
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,670
cyber emergency we would be under the

371
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,180
authority of the state police okay the

372
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,950
the issue with this and I sort of

373
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,100
alluded to this is can anybody tell me

374
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,000
what's the cyber emergency right no of

375
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,740
course not I mean that was my first

376
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,420
question okay I'm gonna get a hundred

377
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,070
people to respond in the event of cyber

378
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,620
emergency what the hell is that

379
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,820
no but exactly exactly but you can get

380
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,980
funding to have an organization by

381
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,390
saying we're gonna respond to a cyber

382
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,800
emergency without defining the terms

383
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,380
right that's your project charter now

384
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,030
you need a project manager to go out

385
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,260
figure out business requirements and

386
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,000
technical specifications right all of

387
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,140
you with your P and PS you know this so

388
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,450
here's what we have for low lower level

389
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,280
incidents and this is why we have the

390
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,070
Michigan cyber civilian Act in place is

391
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,230
for these lower level incidents for a

392
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,690
governor declared cyber emergency if you

393
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,030
look in the Michigan's cyber disruption

394
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,430
response plan which is online I don't

395
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,560
know if this section is online but but

396
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,170
it has different like DEFCON levels you

397
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,790
know and you get to DEFCON five is the

398
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,400
governor declared cyber emergency and

399
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,440
basically for that to happen lives have

400
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,170
to be at stake it's like when a

401
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,530
nation-state has hacked two of the power

402
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,839
supplies up in the Upper Peninsula where

403
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,160
it snows all the time

404
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,099
in December or January and people are

405
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,650
we're gonna be without power there for

406
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,569
three months and people are gonna die

407
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,859
that's the governor declares cyber

408
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,960
emergency and I'm not sure you know the

409
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,400
cyber core I'm not sure what we're gonna

410
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,770
do is chop wood and build fires you know

411
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,810
because people are gonna die

412
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm making fun we could do some things

413
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,040
but basically if you try to recruit a

414
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,280
hundred people to do to be prepared for

415
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,960
a cyber emergency like that they're

416
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,060
gonna be bored all right

417
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,850
I mean imagine this and and this is

418
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,460
frankly what happened up to about 2015

419
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,320
there were people recruited for the

420
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,450
organization but there wasn't anything

421
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,190
to do because you can't you can do a

422
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,200
tabletop exercise everybody been to

423
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,900
tabletop exercises anybody been to one

424
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,940
that's really exciting

425
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,759
yeah I mean there are good ones but most

426
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,259
of the ones that I've been to have been

427
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,119
a bunch of middle managers sitting

428
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,039
around assuring each other that they

429
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,169
have processes that will handle this and

430
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,379
we'll be fine don't worry and I again I

431
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,149
don't mean to completely make fun but

432
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:19,779
they they could be more useful so I've

433
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,489
been working with the State Police and

434
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:25,419
the state of Michigan's sock and in the

435
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,129
National Guard to try and lower our

436
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:29,909
threshold for activation and in fact

437
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,320
Tuesday I'm going to be getting together

438
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,820
with some of the members of the MHC

439
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,169
three we're going to go to the state

440
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:37,599
sock and review a couple of their

441
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,090
incidents and talk about how they handle

442
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,849
things and how we volunteers might

443
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,129
handle things and I'm gonna have a

444
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:48,009
handful of em I see three volunteers who

445
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:50,049
work at different companies and so this

446
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:50,950
is going to give us some information

447
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,830
exchange which didn't happen before

448
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,879
we're not responding to a cyber

449
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,799
emergency but we are raising the level

450
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,099
of security culture in the state so this

451
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,049
is if something were to come in at some

452
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:04,629
lower level we would the cyber incident

453
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:07,059
would go to let me see if I could do

454
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,889
this are there we go

455
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,629
we go to the Michigan cyber command

456
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,879
center and they would vet that for any

457
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,979
criminality because we don't want to you

458
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,840
know walk through the blood like LJ

459
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,119
Simpson or you know we don't want to

460
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,909
mess up any evidence so once they once

461
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,070
they clear under what conditions we can

462
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,629
be involved they call it they call me

463
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:28,299
and I get in touch with our volunteers

464
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,099
and that's another thing we could talk

465
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,159
about offline which is how do you

466
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,629
communicate with your volunteers during

467
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,489
an incident we don't have a good good

468
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,779
way yet but we're working on some things

469
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,090
so if there is criminality then we have

470
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,369
to be careful if not we can go out and

471
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:49,210
just help people it's a partnership

472
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,190
this is the slide iOS show because I

473
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,570
think this is really important we have

474
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,099
the Army and Air National Guard in

475
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,379
Michigan as well as the State Police and

476
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:59,679
the Michigan cyber civilian Corps we our

477
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,690
activities are normal activities besides

478
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,029
responding to incidents and because

479
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,039
you're going to ask right there has not

480
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,210
been an official deployment of mi c3 yet

481
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,730
we just got the

482
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,340
the legal the the Michigan cyber

483
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,880
civilian Act provides us indemnification

484
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,950
you know if we do something stupid we

485
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,350
have now processes in place and

486
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,360
basically if we follow our own processes

487
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,330
then whoever on our team does something

488
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,340
stupid are protected by by Good

489
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,530
Samaritan kind of legislation so that's

490
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,940
important if you're gonna do something

491
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,050
like this we have quarterly we try to

492
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,520
have a face-to-face meeting that

493
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,900
includes the training that's a

494
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,060
face-to-face meeting and then the North

495
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,680
American international cyber summit

496
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,500
which is October 29th this year it's

497
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,450
always in October but you know with the

498
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,560
new governor I don't know we're going to

499
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,360
keep doing that we have a conference

500
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,970
call every month which a lot of times

501
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,280
it's just me saying hey I'm gonna go

502
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,560
talk it besides Augusta about what we're

503
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,350
doing and publicized this but again

504
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,110
before 2015 there was no regular

505
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,050
engagement with members and it's amazing

506
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,510
to me how much of a phone call I mean

507
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,600
how many of us like meetings right no no

508
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,150
we don't like unassuming we don't but

509
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,160
anyway if we have a monthly meeting

510
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,830
it really helps engage the membership we

511
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,810
also have slack and again we're not

512
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,490
reacting to incidents but the level of

513
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,380
engagement and the level of information

514
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,540
sharing that we've gotten across the

515
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,720
state and remember I've got so down here

516
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,060
is Detroit that's where most of the

517
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,960
cybersecurity stuff is the i-94 runs

518
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,930
across the bottom of the of the state

519
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,630
from like Kalamazoo to Detroit but

520
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,540
that's where that's the corridor I mean

521
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,060
geographically if you look I'm not sure

522
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,040
how it would be in Georgia but you're

523
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,430
gonna have pockets of Industry and

524
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,930
knowledge cyber knowledge and then

525
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,210
you're gonna have vast swaths where you

526
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,100
think there are nobody there there's

527
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,220
nobody there but what we found is like I

528
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,300
thought I was the only person in

529
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,500
Kalamazoo Michigan there was an

530
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,540
intersect person well you know duh are

531
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,040
you kind of know theoretically that

532
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,270
there are people but maybe they're not

533
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,100
interested because I never see him at

534
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,350
DEFCON or anything like that we started

535
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,820
talking about these things and people

536
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,440
come out of the woodwork and we have I

537
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,750
now have a group of about two dozen

538
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,120
people that meet monthly in Kalamazoo

539
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,180
and drink I mean

540
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,780
we do drink beer but all this not even

541
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:36,430
going I like beer but anyway so there

542
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,050
are more people out there doing security

543
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,360
than you think and a lot of the tools

544
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,750
that are available like slack that it's

545
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,970
just amazing to see this and so I

546
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,740
actually have there are hundred people

547
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,450
on the roster I will admit that we

548
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,590
probably have thirty or forty people

549
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,510
that are actually active but these are

550
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,850
3040 people that know each other now if

551
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,430
they show up in a room and that doesn't

552
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,650
include the Army and Air Guard and the

553
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,780
State Police people that we have now

554
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,080
interacted with and capture the flag

555
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,580
adventures and we all know the

556
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,920
constraints on us and so we you know but

557
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,230
you go and you get dumped into a fire

558
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,790
the last thing you want to do is be

559
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,760
saying hi I'm so-and-so right so we've

560
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,430
all worked together before it's amazing

561
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,720
so these are our events benefits I've

562
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,310
been talking about we've once and awards

563
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,430
and recognition including them are

564
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,870
really excited about the one on the

565
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,490
bottom the war on the rocks if you do

566
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,380
we're on the rocks as a blog that's run

567
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,720
by the University of Texas NASA's

568
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,490
Security Center and I Estonia has a

569
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,940
cyber civilian defence league I'm gonna

570
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,740
go to Estonia next year I certainly hope

571
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,080
we should have a blog entry on the law

572
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,640
fair blog for anybody that reads that

573
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,550
and this month I've been working with my

574
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,760
friend at Hewlett Foundation to come up

575
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,390
with that so in the future we're

576
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,640
thinking about a proactive component

577
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,730
because you know detection detection and

578
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,550
defense is harder than prevention and we

579
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,850
want to hit it as they say left of boom

580
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,400
here lessons learned which is really

581
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,190
what I want to get to is that you have

582
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,590
to do something like this you have to

583
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,070
build it meaning like constructed but

584
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,170
you also have to allow it to grow and

585
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,990
the thing that was happening when I took

586
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,840
over and this is not a criticism even

587
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,670
though it sounds like it of where it had

588
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,020
been before it's just that it hadn't

589
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,700
gotten to that point there was a lot of

590
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,250
stuff being built there were there were

591
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,690
processes and

592
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,670
the application for testing the test

593
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,250
questions were already written but there

594
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,940
wasn't a lot of allowing allowing people

595
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,210
to find out about it and to choose to be

596
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,730
part of it and people weren't they were

597
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,800
responding to a request somebody would

598
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,450
come up to you like coming up to your

599
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,010
door and say hi and maybe had this skill

600
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,990
would you please help and who can say no

601
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,630
to this but what happens did you get in

602
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,800
your name and a roster and you don't

603
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,570
actually do anything so we had to

604
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,510
provide you know polls for people to be

605
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,580
to be part of this and the thing that my

606
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,520
friend who was the temporary seaso did

607
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,900
was get funding for a sans class and by

608
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,030
golly you know if you tell people will

609
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,850
give you a five-day sans class the the

610
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,100
other side of that was you have to pass

611
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,800
the test and if you if you have a SAN

612
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,290
cert you know those are not trivial

613
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,220
people when I was in the Graduate School

614
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,110
we did research you people study 20 to

615
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,170
40 hours outside of the class to be able

616
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,420
to take the test so people again have to

617
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,340
be serious but it's a serious benefit

618
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,580
also a sans class we did for those of

619
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,950
you you know we did 504 basic ethical

620
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,170
hacking we did network network

621
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,520
monitoring the 5-11

622
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,140
was the second class that we just did

623
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,060
Network forensics and that's the one I'm

624
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,070
calling people you know reminding them I

625
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,750
think I've got 20 people who have passed

626
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,940
the test now I want to get more passed

627
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,430
before the national north american

628
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,860
international cyber summit so you have

629
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,930
to build and grow you have to have top

630
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,330
down and bottom up and for this one I

631
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,730
really looked there is a slide there's a

632
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,590
picture available and I couldn't figure

633
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,930
out how to Google it but you know when

634
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,180
the when the Transcontinental Railroad

635
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,480
got put together they drove the Golden

636
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,940
Spike and I think it was Provo Utah I

637
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,840
wasn't there a mold I'm not that old but

638
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,790
there somebody put together a graphic

639
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,530
where you know there's the railroad

640
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,030
track coming from one side and the

641
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,470
railroad track coming from the other and

642
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,790
they're gonna put the Golden Spike in it

643
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,990
set they meet like this right top down

644
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,890
and bottom up

645
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,740
you have to have the government in my

646
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,180
case I've got the governor which is

647
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,280
awesome I mean I don't think we could

648
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,260
have done it without that and the

649
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,020
legislators bought in we also have

650
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,320
bottom-up which is about

651
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,240
an opportunity for people to be part of

652
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
it you know providing the opportunity

653
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,350
and sometimes they don't match up and

654
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,090
you know sometimes that's okay I I would

655
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,590
love for them to match up because I'm

656
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,710
OCD and and all of those other things

657
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,770
that all of us geeks are but this is a

658
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,420
challenge for somebody doing something

659
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,710
like this is you have to accept that

660
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,510
sometimes they're not going to match up

661
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,460
and you know to continue the train

662
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,990
analogy if you're not going to run a

663
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,410
train on those tracks you know who cares

664
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,630
as long as it looks good because we're

665
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,310
trying to get public you know we have to

666
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,900
have public acceptance and public

667
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,240
support that sort of thing

668
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,040
the other thing is there's multiple

669
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,730
messages and audiences and this leads

670
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,500
into my question I have surprises to

671
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,680
give out these are multiple the multiple

672
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,000
audiences that I have to talk about and

673
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,180
I was clued into this because I did an

674
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,950
interview on perceptions of cyber

675
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,750
security and information security and

676
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,490
information security professionals and

677
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,370
there is some concern as prot if you any

678
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,080
of you read Twitter or Facebook or

679
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,140
anything about info sack there are

680
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,520
questions about how do we get more

681
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,780
minorities into the into the field how

682
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,600
do we deal with lots of drama you know

683
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,450
it's a we need what 300 thousand people

684
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,820
and we can't all be cool people who

685
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,800
watched mr. robot and can quote all the

686
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Monty Python movies from memory right I

687
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,420
mean we were talking at dinner last

688
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,370
night about the cannon and so not a we

689
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,190
got to open it up so I have my time is

690
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,070
up so I'm gonna take all of these

691
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,960
fabulous prizes home with me I'm really

692
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,380
sorry I didn't get a chance to come out

693
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,830
so but speaking of messaging so this is

694
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,390
a question I was asked by the survey

695
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,940
people and I thought I'd bring it to you

696
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,830
so are there any types of like ice this

697
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,720
is the question I got in the interview

698
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,210
and I'm only keeping you from lunch so

699
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,910
if you need to go at lunch fine

700
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,570
so I sent him a picture of my my laptop

701
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,340
right all of you many of you have

702
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,230
stickers on your laptops I don't know

703
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,960
that that's the sort of visual but there

704
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,490
are any visuals in the cybersecurity

705
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,179
space

706
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,210
that inspire you or do you think work

707
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:15,259
and what am I bid for this is prize

708
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:18,889
number one is an an alpha wireless

709
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:20,479
adapter that can be used for sniffing

710
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:23,299
I'm sure it's compatible with Kali so

711
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,580
and in fact that was one of the things I

712
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,440
sent them was the Kali logo you know

713
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,629
because it's ninja it's quiet it appeals

714
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:32,809
to us for that reason so when you when

715
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,210
you see a visual obviously you all seem

716
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,570
like mr. robot hook hook erse hoodies

717
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,879
hoodies not hooker tonight hookers with

718
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,219
hoodies maybe I don't know but hoodies

719
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,469
are but you know a common one what else

720
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:47,929
what works for you and particularly

721
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,279
something that's working that you're

722
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,639
surprised

723
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,389
the quiet right right that's the that's

724
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:59,979
not a visual though it's words yeah

725
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:04,269
skull why why skull

726
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,710
do you celebrate the day of the death

727
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,770
okay so would you like this okay use it

728
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,020
use it use your powers for good so the

729
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,050
question was for the people at home or

730
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,690
the the contribution was a skull because

731
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,640
skull means that you've actually

732
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,380
survived to death because skulls do

733
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,000
survive death bonus heart and it reminds

734
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,580
me that I've seen the lo the day of the

735
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,530
dead it's actually a celebration you

736
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,420
know and some of the some of the symbols

737
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,190
for that are skulls and they look like

738
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,320
they would be scary kids you know little

739
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,320
kids would probably be scary but what Oh

740
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,920
a Phoenix a Phoenix would be this that's

741
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,590
an a good idea can you think of

742
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,670
something that well let's see so who

743
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,980
doesn't have done Murdock's excellent

744
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,640
vol.1 a blue team handbook and has an

745
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,520
idea of a visual that works for them

746
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,630
what yep

747
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:27,029
so what what's your visual give a

748
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,450
suggestion

749
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,060
okay we give points for bravery okay

750
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,100
I'll keep the set you can come down here

751
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,440
and get this it because they're going to

752
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,910
run me off the stage

753
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,430
how about volume 2 of the Yano think

754
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:50,490
you're getting the hook so who has yes

755
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,640
sir

756
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:04,490
yep the dog Callie out of them yeah

757
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,740
yep

758
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,410
I think John strand won't actually run

759
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,560
Metasploit until he gets to a singular

760
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,590
logo odd that's what I that's what I

761
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,490
think I remember yeah so I'm gonna I'm

762
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,680
not gonna walk up there because if I do

763
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,180
they're not gonna let me back on the

764
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,320
stage before before I take your I want

765
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,640
to tell you what kind of fabulous prize

766
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,110
you're competing for this is a gig of

767
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:54,280
fast Wi-Fi router an off alpha AC 1200

768
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,110
art and I'll bet it's flashable with

769
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,350
open work so now do you want to you do

770
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,130
you want to rethink your answer sir oh

771
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:19,240
damn okay okay okay I'm I I was a member

772
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,420
at the time and I had scored well on the

773
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,510
exams and I also had experience spinning

774
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,280
up a master's program I had sort of

775
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,260
leadership experience and information

776
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,520
security and I was just I was vocally

777
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,350
dissatisfied with how things were

778
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,180
happening in the mi c3 and they said

779
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,260
you're so smart you do it so I ha I was

780
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,270
hired in as a contract I'm a contractor

781
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:48,550
for the state but I do it because I love

782
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,550
it so they pay me you know I am a

783
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,000
contractor are not an FTE this is my job

784
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,450
if the if the governor decides he does

785
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,950
or if the next governor incites we're

786
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,960
not going to do this the state actually

787
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,790
has something called C so as a service

788
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,380
that they're doing is more the proactive

789
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,300
thing where they'll go around and help

790
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,969
small organizations do you know put

791
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,739
together processes and plans that

792
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,780
doesn't interest me and if they asked me

793
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,800
to do that I probably won't so that I

794
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,350
don't I don't get paid full-time and it

795
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,940
certainly doesn't take me full time

796
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,168
because if you've worked for either

797
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,389
academia or government you know that

798
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,860
you'll kick something off and then you

799
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,909
go take a two-week vacation so I put in

800
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,730
usually fewer than 10 hours a week but I

801
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,710
love it I mean that's actually on the

802
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,900
organization I do some 1099 work for

803
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,900
sands my whole life is living in packets

804
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,560
so you know what's working what's not

805
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,710
but I get I I get health insurance which

806
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:01,020
at my age is the thing yes sir you what

807
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,180
target and crosshairs um okay I so the

808
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,990
the question was am I volunteer and my

809
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,150
voluntold is it my assignment and that

810
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,860
was the answer about then I'm a contract

811
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,110
the suggestion for visual is targeted

812
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,570
crosshairs which is a little threatening

813
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:25,270
perhaps but you know the Unicorn

814
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,850
what's so somebody has suggested a

815
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,840
