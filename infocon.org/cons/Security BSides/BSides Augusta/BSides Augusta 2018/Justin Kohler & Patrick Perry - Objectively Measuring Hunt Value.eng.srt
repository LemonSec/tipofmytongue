1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,400
so

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
jinda so we're gonna cover a little bit

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,910
about us

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,759
we'll cover the problem that we saw and

5
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,039
then we'll establish some basics for our

6
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,020
solution to that problem some of the

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,520
reports you can get out of it and then

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,289
hopefully you feel like you can do this

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,949
too it's a little bit about myself I'm

10
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:37,290
the leader the customer success team at

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,160
gigamon insight we were formerly iceberg

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,589
you don't know that we're a network

13
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:45,120
security monitoring platform and we just

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,650
got acquired in July I'm really big into

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,299
processing data I feel like that's the

16
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,580
common thing over my career is the

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,860
ability to understand a problem break it

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,379
apart into pieces explain it back to the

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,989
person who told me the problem develop

20
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,019
an objective hypothesis about that and

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,830
then see if they agree and then provide

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,740
them a solution if you kind of notice

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,750
I've done that here I know that I'm

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,580
between you and beer right now cuz we're

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,590
right about four I've given you a little

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,990
progress bar just to give you an example

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,110
that I I'm in I was a former Air Force

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,540
linguist I have an MBA which I found out

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,830
yesterday is kind of a four-letter word

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,170
here and then I got some security certs

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,380
to

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,450
person throughout the talk who can tie

33
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,490
this into like the Food Network and

34
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,200
cooking and recipes and all this fun

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:30,240
stuff but Justin so just apologize so

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,730
the important point I think to bring up

37
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,040
right here is that Justin is an expert

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,580
process I do respect what he brings to

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,170
the table he's really good at what he

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,130
does

41
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,920
sort of my role here as I see it is I'm

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,760
kind of like I'm Justin freeing some

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,630
street cred along with them so this

44
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,320
process guy

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,660
[Music]

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,859
[Laughter]

47
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,600
these are some things I've done in the

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,630
past

49
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:44,280
favorite conference I recognized and my

50
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,310
which now becomes sort of infamous for

51
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,840
me it is the talk he gave five years ago

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,519
on something called the Fed for wall if

53
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,109
you're not familiar with that just go to

54
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:58,200
youtube and look up that first wall

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,189
amazing talk which I still watch

56
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,480
sometimes through my mental this

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,510
actually happened in my life so as that

58
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,739
Derby County couple weeks ago people

59
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,209
still come on feel like hey you're the

60
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,349
ball guy yes

61
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,879
my current computing interest as an

62
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,940
analytics tool like this is relevant

63
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,029
here because the whole animal excited

64
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,500
thing like I like to take things and

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,300
make it better so it ties in well with

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,800
what Justin's trying to do here with

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,349
getting a process around hunting and

68
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,759
finally if we have any basketball fans

69
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,990
here like basketballs on a favorite

70
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,030
thing so I love us talk about basketball

71
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,789
from Greater Boston so I love Brad

72
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,509
Stevens he is a tactical wizard and

73
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:41,800
that's how I like to think of myself as

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,220
a tactical wizard Justin's on this guy

75
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,930
okay so a little a little disclaimer

76
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,960
here and this first this is not a talk

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,370
on how to or why you should conduct

78
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,340
threat hunting we smarter people have

79
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,280
done that already before what we're

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
doing here is talking about the process

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,840
on capturing and reporting and measuring

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,039
the value of your stret hunting

83
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,830
operations it was kind of a pain point

84
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,090
that we observed and a lot of our

85
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,500
customers and partner environments

86
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,390
[Music]

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,030
do what he does I want to give you a so

88
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,190
what I'm gonna start with is there's no

89
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,590
defined industry standard right now for

90
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,030
what fret money is it kinda means

91
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,989
different things to different people

92
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,639
[Music]

93
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,280
some people will refer to threat hunting

94
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,020
is retrospective detection or kind of

95
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,350
like the the manually the going through

96
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,480
hunting for data trying to manually

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,620
search things and answer questions

98
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,840
threat hunting is human directed so it's

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,400
different than you know your classic

100
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,030
like alert driven detection stuff like

101
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,260
there's there has to be human

102
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,570
interaction involves both pose questions

103
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,210
answer questions and pivot oops it's

104
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,260
like I just said it begins with a

105
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,780
question hopefully it's an interesting

106
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,400
question because I find that's typically

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,200
more fun to hunt for something that's

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,970
interesting to answer but doesn't have

109
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,580
to be interesting either then another

110
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,990
key thing like I said is being able to

111
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,970
pivot or be able to go down deeper and

112
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,270
deeper into two additional rabbit holes

113
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,130
as as you're looking for data on a

114
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,860
network and finally for general hunting

115
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,270
context key thing to me is that it just

116
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,130
this idea of iteration threat hunting

117
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,710
it's a very much a rinse and repeat kind

118
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,090
of a process it's never really done it's

119
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,530
never truly finished it's something that

120
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,330
you're going to ask a question try and

121
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,760
answer it leads to more questions rinse

122
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,280
and repeat so what I'll say here is even

123
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,530
though there's no standard definition

124
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,120
this is what our favorite definition is

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,950
and this comes from the folks at

126
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,720
squirrel it's important in terms of

127
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,680
level setting so I'm going to read this

128
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,690
verbatim threat hunting is the human

129
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,370
driven proactive and iterative search

130
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,140
through networks endpoints or data sets

131
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,940
in order to detect malicious suspicious

132
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,320
or risky activities that have evaded

133
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,640
detection by existing automated tools so

134
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,800
let's get into the problem that we saw

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,310
I'm curious

136
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,580
who is a throw hunting program right now

137
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,139
how many people were thinking of

138
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,800
introducing a throat hunting program I'm

139
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,880
very curious if you seen this so we

140
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,900
found that there was tons of great

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,639
content on hunting right

142
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,770
everything from why you should conduct

143
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,480
throat threat hunting I think this is

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,460
probably to cover the most there's a

145
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,910
bunch of examples on how right

146
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,680
everything from the specifics on how you

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,750
should form a hypothesis in the process

148
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,810
there you can doubt and download there's

149
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,610
a bunch of examples on github of

150
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,640
previous hypothesis that people have

151
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,280
developed there's even data quality

152
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,540
measurements that people will suggest

153
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,080
how you should measure those and then

154
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
there's webinars right every every

155
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,870
vendors like practical threat hunting

156
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,169
and annex tool and those in while I joke

157
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,450
a ton they are useful right they give

158
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,669
you an idea maybe you don't use that

159
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,160
tool but you kind of extrapolate it and

160
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,370
apply it to your program so you can

161
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,080
start getting this idea right we could

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,429
do this so the excitement builds we've

163
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,929
got our best people on this I've got a

164
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,880
tool set I've got logs I can start doing

165
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,670
this I read this thing on hypothesis I

166
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,640
went to a class for four days and you

167
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,070
know I focus really hard on hypothesis

168
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,550
let's do this let's find evil so we're

169
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,650
going hunting and we're getting excited

170
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,610
about it

171
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,980
and you know this was a lot of our

172
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,690
customers were really excited about this

173
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,960
and I heard this in the industry and

174
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,190
then the questions start building right

175
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,530
how are you gonna measure success it was

176
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,210
funny because we'd asked that question

177
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,690
and and people kind of pulled back does

178
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,040
your management understand what your

179
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,920
goals are and do they agree when you

180
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,770
talk about metrics how are you actually

181
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,960
gonna collect those like is somebody

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,070
gonna put that into Excel who

183
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,360
specifically is that your hunted hunter

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,710
that's doing that while he does it

185
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,820
um who's your long-term manager of this

186
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,810
how are you going to make sure that this

187
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,730
kind of achieves the outcomes that

188
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,540
you've you've set out yeah whatever

189
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,070
right we're

190
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,510
you know where this is going right we're

191
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,440
hunting evil let's do this so this is

192
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,140
typical hunting program and like all

193
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,490
hunting programs catch them we're done

194
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,690
those with hunting programs how many

195
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,010
times does this happen right

196
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,370
this is immediately every time yeah no

197
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:09,930
you don't find evil you find stupid find

198
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,210
all this stuff right and and and let me

199
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,210
let me make sure I'm clear that there is

200
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,240
value here we know that this is valuable

201
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,080
right you remember our definition it's

202
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,390
not just about malicious or evil it's

203
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,820
about suspicious and risky right these

204
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,610
are all those things and yeah okay

205
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,960
you'll find some evil here or there if

206
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,390
you haven't found evil though this is

207
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,850
what happens right your management's

208
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,580
like okay well what are you doing right

209
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,140
we get things like did you catch them

210
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,190
yet our lead analyst is dedicated to

211
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,210
this what are they doing since they

212
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,340
don't seem busy can you have them do

213
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,260
this and we saw this a lot actually this

214
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,680
was pretty depressing would lead Tier

215
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,080
three seasoned practitioners who'd be

216
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,390
tasked with well can you have them

217
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,610
approve non-approved software installs

218
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,540
and it's because they nobody was

219
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,130
proactively reporting on the outcomes

220
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,890
that they were discovering and so is

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,870
this really adding value is a question

222
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,230
that they were asking so can you blame

223
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,240
them when I say them I mean management

224
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,830
maybe I'll say that it might seem when

225
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,320
when we start out projects most of the

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,470
time hopefully we set out a set of

227
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,970
objectives that we can communicate out

228
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,560
right I have a manager I got to

229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,970
establish what we're doing on a day to

230
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,680
day basis and then kind of report on how

231
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,410
we're doing that hopefully your managers

232
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,520
are doing that too or at least you're

233
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,730
thinking about this but it's it's a team

234
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,230
effort right when we say we're going to

235
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,980
establish an outcome or some we're going

236
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,390
to collect metrics I

237
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,400
I challenge my team to say okay well how

238
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,430
how are you gonna do that without that

239
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,960
so if I if I set out a project with my

240
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,730
team and and they say we're gonna go

241
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,740
hunting we're going to find evil and

242
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,420
they don't challenge me on this and we

243
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,920
don't send out like what we're active

244
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,080
and then do I'd go with the last thing

245
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,520
that I remember right well threat

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,020
hunting is gonna find evil that's that's

247
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,510
the most eye-catching thing so this is

248
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,790
the target right and if you don't catch

249
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,240
evil you're not really doing what you

250
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,130
said you were going to do but we knew

251
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,260
that hunting is more than just catching

252
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,510
evil right there's there's value in all

253
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,390
that stupid stuff that we found so we

254
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,110
have to proactively make our target here

255
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,380
right we have to plan for and collect

256
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,120
those other metrics that are not just

257
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,140
apt okay yeah so Justin's previous slide

258
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,000
can I blame management as a practitioner

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,710
oh hell yes but what I need to do here

260
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,940
again if we're gonna turn Justin loose

261
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,340
with his process and sweet pivottables

262
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,210
or whatever he has we have to level set

263
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,210
so again this is not going to be like an

264
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,160
in the weeds sort of this is how you

265
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,590
hunt that's that's not what this is

266
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,480
we're just trying to I'm trying to set

267
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,430
the stage so we have some shared

268
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,170
terminology that we can use to try and

269
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,480
effectively communicate what we're going

270
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,640
for with the process here so the 10,000

271
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,720
foot view of what I'm going to talk

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,090
about here for a couple minutes are

273
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,400
three fixes I'm gonna talk hunting

274
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,980
hypothesis and very simply that's what

275
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,740
we're gonna define the question I'm

276
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,600
gonna talk about hunting activity that's

277
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,040
the fun part that's where we're out

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,250
trying to find stuff and finally we're

279
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,500
going to talk about the outcome and the

280
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,680
outcome is often overlooked because like

281
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,270
Justin said we're not just looking for

282
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,340
you oh we're looking for stupid it all

283
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,680
has value and that's uh those are things

284
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,270
we hope to find in that outcome okay so

285
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,960
for hunting hypothesis there's a really

286
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,930
great quote that I'll start with

287
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,660
this is where the bulk of the work in

288
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,029
this development is going to happen okay

289
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,470
it's at the front end in the hunting

290
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,290
hypothesis and the the quote that I'll

291
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,310
use is from Abraham Lincoln and I know

292
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,480
some of you have certainly heard this

293
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,760
before I don't want to butcher this go

294
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,810
something like this it's like if you

295
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,390
give me six hours to chop a tree I'll

296
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,430
use the first four to sharpen my axe

297
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,459
okay and that really applies to this

298
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,490
phase of the hunt so when I say three

299
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,770
plus days we're talking about say we're

300
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,350
going to dedicate a week to a specific

301
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,899
hunt the bulk of that time is going to

302
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,399
be in this phase of it it's going to be

303
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,140
in developing this hunting hypothesis

304
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,980
the way we developed that is we start

305
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,680
with a mitre attack framework and what's

306
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,360
great about that is that we have our

307
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,600
TTP's laid out here we have our tactics

308
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
blue across the top there in this matrix

309
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,290
those are going to be things like

310
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,290
credential access discovery initial

311
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,550
access things like that techniques those

312
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,260
are going to be in the columns

313
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,529
underneath the tactics so initial access

314
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,830
is the technique there and the top left

315
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,810
is the tactic in the top left and the

316
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,550
techniques are what's underneath it

317
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,320
we're gonna zoom in here on the

318
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,570
technique of drive-by compromise because

319
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,089
that's going to have specific procedures

320
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,220
that apply to that in this case we've

321
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,290
got things like a legitimate website is

322
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,390
compromised where adversaries have

323
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,820
injected some form of malicious code

324
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,959
might be some sort of malicious ad

325
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,700
network different things like that those

326
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,620
are different questions that we can kind

327
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,980
of answer that we can tie to our hunting

328
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,540
hypothesis this is what's going to drive

329
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,500
that process for us

330
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,440
Specter ops is company that we partner

331
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,480
with quite a bit and what we've

332
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,040
essentially done here is is stolen some

333
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,710
of their work because it's easy and

334
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,240
because it's simple and explains what

335
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,330
what we do so they have a five-step

336
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,680
process for developing the signing

337
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,470
hypothesis we just talked about sort of

338
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,450
tactic technique and procedure that was

339
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,700
the previous slide but the next part of

340
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,970
that developing the hypothesis is being

341
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,220
able to collect requirements so that

342
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,290
means sitting down and thinking about

343
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,170
okay if I want to answer a question like

344
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,290
say my hypothesis is something like I

345
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,140
believe that an intruder is using RDP to

346
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,240
move laterally in my network okay that

347
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,100
might be a hypothesis it's something

348
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,720
that we can test so we we can get that

349
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,630
from the the TTP's but now we need to

350
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,460
collect requirements to be able to sort

351
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,630
of answer that question so what are we

352
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,760
going to need well maybe we can use some

353
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,830
broken locks try to answer that maybe we

354
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,030
have Braille RDP logs but we want to sit

355
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,260
down it's sort of like a brainstorm

356
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,350
session what is available to me that can

357
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,859
prove or disprove my hypothesis next

358
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,359
thing we have to examine is the scope

359
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,099
right we need to sort of set some

360
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,569
boundaries and limitations around what

361
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,869
we're doing so scope might be I want to

362
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,400
look back the last week the last month

363
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,099
last year we have to set some parameters

364
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,109
maybe we only care about a certain set

365
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,630
of subnets right but it's important to

366
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,050
document all this excluded factors what

367
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,089
that's going to be if we go back to my

368
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,110
already P example that's gonna be

369
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,930
something like okay maybe it would be

370
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,820
super useful to have Windows security

371
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,940
locks for that but they're too hard to

372
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,620
get in this case or I don't have time

373
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,090
this week to get it or whatever the case

374
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,370
might be but it's important to document

375
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,540
that that was something we didn't

376
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,770
include here because it could be the

377
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,990
seed of another hunt later so that's the

378
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,430
first phase the second phase is the

379
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,310
hunting activity hunting activity where

380
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,170
the rubber meets the road it's where

381
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,850
we're actually executing the the

382
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,840
searches or to professor once in college

383
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,240
that used to say any great question

384
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,280
leads to further questions and that's

385
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,890
kind of what I think of here because as

386
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,870
you learn more about what you're looking

387
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,630
for you know it may well inform your

388
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,280
original hypothesis you might make new

389
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,190
hypotheses from that so and that all

390
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,020
happens in the activity phase and

391
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,179
there's really three kind of buckets

392
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,429
that that this can go into there's going

393
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,380
to be potentially malicious activity

394
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,330
found although in my experience that's

395
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,830
usually the least common thing to happen

396
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,890
in a hunt there may be non malicious

397
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,840
activity found right we're gonna

398
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,120
identify logging gaps we're gonna

399
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,460
identify vulnerabilities we're gonna

400
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,470
identify stupid and then finally we

401
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,030
might just find nothing and that's okay

402
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,380
because it's still telling us something

403
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,190
and the third phase of the hunting that

404
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,390
I want to talk about here is is the

405
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,960
outcome and the outcome this is I think

406
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,570
the most overlooked of least often done

407
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,250
phase but honestly it's probably the

408
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
most important because you can do it in

409
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,059
less than a couple hours but just

410
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,760
document right was an incident created

411
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,880
from that hunt that we just developed

412
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
like I said were there new detections

413
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
that were able to be created or new

414
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,920
analytics was there any sort of

415
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,420
vulnerability identified any logging

416
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,370
gaps identified any stupid people I mean

417
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,750
all important things and so I'm curious

418
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,910
how many people track outcomes in their

419
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,190
hunt programs anybody have kind of like

420
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,860
very defined ones so one thing that we

421
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,780
found is is people that did track

422
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,740
outcomes tying them back in and a good

423
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,260
way to the organization right if I'm to

424
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,600
see so but you know a lot of CISOs love

425
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,850
to use frameworks how are we doing how

426
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,620
are we improving these five areas and

427
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,410
NIST's es effort or where does this fall

428
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,320
in the top 20 and so what we tried to do

429
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,240
was if you're gonna do find an outcome

430
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,210
right tie that back to whatever your

431
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,150
framework is that you use it added a

432
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,910
whole lot of value to the customers that

433
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,080
we're showing this previously so I'll go

434
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,790
into the solution or kind of at least

435
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,179
our approach to the solution

436
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,750
so we're going to define our processes

437
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,270
using confluence and JIRA confluence and

438
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,980
JIRA is just what we had we're not we

439
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,200
don't know not employed by Atlassian or

440
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,360
anything we're gonna use industry

441
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,490
standard frameworks like miter attack to

442
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,159
develop our hypothesis and we'll focus

443
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,279
on the CIS top 20 to organize our

444
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,159
outcomes we're gonna provide business

445
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,750
relevant metrics from this we're going

446
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,909
to show kind of like numbers of logging

447
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,710
gaps numbers of detections created

448
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,440
numbers of active hunts in progress and

449
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,730
then maybe any incidents that have

450
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,830
rolled out of this and if that doesn't

451
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,750
work yeah we got charts and graphs and

452
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,149
hopefully that'll just make them stop

453
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,570
asking questions

454
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,649
so so JIRA for those I believe most

455
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,500
people are familiar with JIRA jiriz used

456
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,779
to plan track and report on projects and

457
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,640
then confluence is like a basic

458
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,820
knowledge base it the reason why we

459
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,789
chose both of those is it's it's $20 for

460
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,649
up to 10 users you can deploy this like

461
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,450
you there's JIRA cloud and JIRA server

462
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,240
they're pretty pretty cheap they're

463
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,250
pretty powerful they can be admittedly

464
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,590
extremely frustrating but we developed a

465
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,510
config that hopefully you can just kind

466
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,809
of stand up and deploy so how we're

467
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:38,919
going to use that we're gonna track

468
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,049
hunts in JIRA we're gonna track all the

469
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,779
hypothesis activities and outcomes and

470
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:46,000
then we're going to automate reports in

471
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,289
confluence and these are all native

472
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,029
there's nothing super fancy we're doing

473
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,270
and either of these tools so a little

474
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,080
bit of baselining

475
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,399
for standard issued 0 types there's an

476
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,529
epoch and then you have multiple things

477
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,090
that will fall under that epoch like a

478
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,640
task and then you could have a subtasks

479
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,960
that go a task for an example of this is

480
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,399
like I'm gonna bake a cake right and I

481
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,110
need a prep ingredients and I need to

482
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,360
mix ingredients under prep ingredients I

483
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,770
might break down that further and say I

484
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,240
need to buy them and then measure and

485
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,679
sort so for ours we we do we wanted to

486
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,450
focus on the miter attack tactics so

487
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,299
there's I'm asking you this question I

488
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:26,980
can remember how many there are across

489
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,390
the side I should know that before I

490
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,580
started the slide but anyway so there's

491
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,169
there those are all pre filled and the

492
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,760
config that we have

493
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,140
and then you can generate hunting

494
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,150
hypothesis activities and outcomes and

495
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,960
they'll tie back to the original epic

496
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,300
so the standard JIRA issue states are to

497
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,340
do in progress and done pretty basic for

498
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,050
anybody who's used a Kanban board right

499
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,450
you move us through as as you're going

500
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,000
we'll see if I if we don't screw this up

501
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,210
by the end of this so our issue States

502
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,650
this is really important because each

503
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,340
each type has its own issue state so for

504
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,730
a hunting hypothesis you have planned

505
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,750
excuse me I need to drink some water so

506
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,480
plan like we know we want to hunt for

507
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,430
our DP lateral movement right that

508
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,800
that's an idea that's not a hypothesis

509
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,220
right when you're developing the the

510
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,680
actual scope of that that that's when

511
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,880
you'll move it to the development phase

512
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,130
when it's ready to kick off activities

513
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,160
then you move it to the production side

514
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,390
anybody think of why you would retire a

515
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:33,450
hunt one

516
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,940
huh you want my ID all right I'd say

517
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,990
that that's a really good any I would

518
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,300
agree with that

519
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,770
any other ideas why you would retire it

520
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:04,110
no wrong longer up what about good

521
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,640
yeah so what we were thinking is you

522
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,320
could retire it if you promote it into

523
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,120
an analytic or detection right you prove

524
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,550
it out so tightly that now you can flip

525
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,290
it over back to your sock as a detection

526
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,150
right so then you'd retire it because

527
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,680
you're no longer using it to conduct

528
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,610
hunting activities hunting activities so

529
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,500
we have our standard to do in progress

530
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,730
and then we have our three outcome

531
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,770
outcome types right so malicious

532
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,570
activity found non malicious activity

533
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,500
found nothing found

534
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,140
and then hunting outcomes just because

535
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,180
you find something doesn't mean it's

536
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,190
done right like we found a whole bunch

537
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,770
of missing logs but now we got a pester

538
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,750
i.t to make sure we get those logs so we

539
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,400
wanted to track the progress of those

540
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,650
and if you use like ServiceNow or JIRA

541
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,020
maybe your IT team uses JIRA you tagged

542
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,360
them in that outcome and then track that

543
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,540
to completion as well so altogether now

544
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,610
this is a really complex slide I'll go

545
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,010
ahead and admit this so at the top if

546
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,990
for an example we have lateral movement

547
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,690
as an epoch we have an idea we're gonna

548
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,140
look for a remote desktop protocol in

549
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,010
lateral movement that's it so we start

550
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,050
developing this right we're going to use

551
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,360
these procedures here's our collection

552
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,740
requirements here's our scope we're

553
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,690
ready to actually do it it's ready for

554
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,730
production we're going to move it to

555
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,800
production and in the config itself you

556
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,980
can't actually conduct hunting activity

557
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,200
unless you tie it back to a production

558
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,580
level hypothesis if this is a confusing

559
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,290
we'll share the slides and it's all

560
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,590
documented on the confluence itself so

561
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,270
then I can kick off a hunting activity

562
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,370
and it's tied back you can link issues

563
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,200
in JIRA so we're tying that back to the

564
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,630
original hypothesis and this is pretty

565
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,460
basic it just says okay Justin did this

566
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,910
on on October 20th and then I found some

567
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,950
stupid stuff right

568
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,710
I found that we're not logging RDP

569
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,990
connections for our second domain that's

570
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,230
that's the problem and then I found Bob

571
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,020
using domain admin creds for RDP logins

572
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,720
so I'm gonna go yell at Bob but this is

573
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,010
the process kind of from end to end

574
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,050
right and all of these are linked

575
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,700
through through how we constructed it in

576
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,910
JIRA

577
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,000
thanks captain process so as we look at

578
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,400
the JIRA go back to the three phases of

579
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,710
the hunt that I talked about hypothesis

580
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,210
this is the data that's going to be

581
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,800
available to a third that we also need

582
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,850
to populate so detailed view here we're

583
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,650
gonna have the title it's going to be

584
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,230
the mitre technique that we talked about

585
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,120
we're gonna have the ongoing status

586
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,610
that's tracked here we're gonna have the

587
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,450
mitre tactic label as Justin's mentioned

588
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,670
this is going to link back to the epoch

589
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,160
which becomes super important to this

590
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,390
guy later I don't care no I care hot

591
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:10,330
Justin you want to keep hunting yeah and

592
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,550
and so this part of the hypothesis is

593
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,750
really important because this is where

594
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,090
we're really documenting that that part

595
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,430
that took all of the time okay so we're

596
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,440
gonna have the hypothesis we're gonna

597
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
have the techniques that we're looking

598
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,390
for here so this could literally be like

599
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,840
the specific hunts that you're going to

600
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,250
execute to try and prove or disprove

601
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,700
your your hypothesis and the collection

602
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,480
requirements scope and then the excluded

603
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,860
factors activity the second phase of

604
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,140
that that we talked about again this is

605
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,250
just the detail viewed what we're gonna

606
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,650
have their generic title I don't know

607
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,480
why Justin would be in this because he

608
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,950
doesn't hunt he just makes processes I

609
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:58,180
can dream we're gonna have the status

610
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,060
again to track that mitre tactic label

611
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,280
link back to the epic Justin's getting

612
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,940
excited now and working notes and what

613
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,600
this can be is it's not necessarily like

614
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,460
a running diary per se it might just be

615
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,890
something that we noticed that might be

616
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,510
relevant it might be relevant to a hunt

617
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,580
in the future but we're gonna plug it in

618
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,780
here it's gonna be a way to store that

619
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,070
and then finally are our outcomes and we

620
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,200
just have outcome one here there can

621
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,730
certainly be more than one outcome in a

622
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,190
hunt but this is just to show you what

623
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,900
we have so we're going to have a

624
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,780
descriptive title in this case whether

625
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,570
it's hard to read no logging for our

626
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,249
yeah that's right our DP event logs

627
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:44,320
missing from our second domain we're

628
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,749
gonna have the status as well another

629
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:50,009
link to the epic The MITRE tactic label

630
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:52,450
what kind of outcome type is it

631
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,690
and again our working notes that we

632
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:02,220
talked about this one once again

633
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,200
yeah so that's a good question um so

634
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,230
that's done here I'll back up so that's

635
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,040
actually done actually didn't highlight

636
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,150
it oh I didn't highlight it Oh bummer

637
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,790
so that was C C right right above this

638
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,220
red box there's a I'm not sure if you

639
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,600
can read it but trust me the critical

640
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,290
tier decontrol is listed there right 600

641
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,760
lines that's gonna be a lot there's only

642
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,530
20 here which that was kind of playing

643
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,650
in my favor but you could certainly pump

644
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,240
in as many you know that's where you

645
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:28,090
would link it okay and this is where

646
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,770
Justin's precious MBA heart starts to

647
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,320
flutter because all of this magic is

648
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,560
just linked together and he can look at

649
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,270
all in one place and feel really good

650
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,220
about what he did yeah yeah all right so

651
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,020
let's get to the reports so this is

652
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,940
where we kind of do all that linking

653
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,100
that you saw on JIRA this is why we were

654
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,370
doing that right is the reports so we

655
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,650
did some example reports we just have a

656
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,900
general report on outcomes we have the

657
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,050
CIS top 20 it's very simplistic the

658
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,910
mitre attack where our coverage is I'll

659
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,710
show you all these and then general user

660
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,610
statistics

661
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,620
you could easily one thing we didn't do

662
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,570
that was another option we ran out of

663
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,630
time was a tool specific report right

664
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,700
which tools are aiding in my hunting

665
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,620
right you could tag tools very easily in

666
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,430
this and and again these are all

667
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,390
automatic and and these are

668
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,100
out-of-the-box reports generated by

669
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,390
confluence that's why you're gonna see a

670
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,040
lot of pie charts I didn't want to make

671
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,840
this overly complex and then you guys

672
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,850
have a lot of development or theater

673
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,830
pull back out of it

674
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,900
so outcomes report what are we finding

675
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,990
who specifically is finding it are they

676
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,970
reporting accurately so we think that

677
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,010
nothing found should only be about 20%

678
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,720
of hunt end states right so do I have a

679
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,120
hunter that is not reporting outcomes

680
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,460
accurately or they are they thinking

681
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,490
evil when they should be thinking stupid

682
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,530
our our outcomes being actioned right

683
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,300
below here you can see outcomes in

684
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,580
progress so am I just finding a bunch of

685
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,750
stuff and then it sits with IT forever

686
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,600
so CIS top 20 this is where I would show

687
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,310
kind of you know if in this fictitious

688
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,020
world that I'm managing a threat hunting

689
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,960
team if I'm reporting back to the sea so

690
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,600
how does this up level of us and our

691
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,240
trusted use framework I'm going to

692
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,580
report any large gap areas do we have

693
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,440
gaps in the basics are we are we

694
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,690
focusing on some deployments maybe in

695
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,460
the organizational controls that maybe

696
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,340
we need to reprioritize and step back up

697
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,000
into the basics on the attack report

698
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,030
where's my hunt team focused and where

699
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,970
should they be focused right is the lack

700
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,060
of focus on data exfil just because we

701
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,080
have really good coverage there on

702
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,880
existing tools and we don't need a hunt

703
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,360
there and then finally general user

704
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,700
statistics what's going on right now

705
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,010
what is stalled and where can I help so

706
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,450
one of the things that we said earlier

707
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,060
was hunting activity should be about one

708
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,530
or two days right you do a lot of work

709
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,240
in the hunt hypothesis and then you

710
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,880
execute that pretty quickly excuse me if

711
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,100
an activity is lasting for more than one

712
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,140
or two days and there's no active no

713
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,880
updates on the ticket it'll report it

714
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,250
here and and basically I'm looking for

715
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,860
where can I help right where can I reach

716
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,270
out and see who got stalled and their

717
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,620
work and do they need some help and then

718
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,220
who's the most productive right just

719
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,750
kidding yeah don't do that that's that's

720
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,060
gonna kill this right away right you

721
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,190
definitely this is supposed to be useful

722
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,360
for your team and what you don't walk it

723
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,850
really fine here you want to make this

724
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,670
useful for management right you want to

725
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,110
report back what you're doing how you're

726
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,260
a value to the organization you don't

727
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,700
want to artificially float a bunch of

728
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,600
tickets right that's

729
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,480
is gonna kill this and you're gonna

730
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,850
generate additional scrutiny so general

731
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,070
notes again we were using native

732
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,080
confluence we're going to host the

733
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,600
configuration soon if you want it before

734
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,300
we host it on github just email us

735
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,590
directly and we'll send it to you so

736
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,179
there's a toll there's a ton of

737
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,639
automations and customizations you can

738
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,830
get for JIRA they're really easy out of

739
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,929
the box kind of you just enable them in

740
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,400
JIRA and they could it make this

741
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,520
amazingly easy for you I did not go that

742
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,020
route because then you'd have to unwind

743
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,360
a lot of the work it's better to use

744
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,250
this as like a starting framework and

745
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,620
then develop what you guys want to do

746
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,000
going forward and you know autumn

747
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,770
automate from there so and you can too

748
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,560
so one of the first things I got when I

749
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,170
first showed somebody this is god this

750
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,760
seems like a lot of work my team's not

751
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,540
gonna do this tough right you're asking

752
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,960
this the organization to just give you

753
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,630
air cover for the most highly skilled

754
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,909
personnel in your environment and then

755
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,290
not gonna show them anything on the

756
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,880
outside that's that's gonna end badly

757
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,770
we've actually saw about a bunch of

758
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,810
times right you know again what are you

759
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,890
doing for our organization also this is

760
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,760
extremely valuable to kind of I went on

761
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,830
to say democratize the knowledge across

762
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,020
your team right how many times have you

763
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,790
seen this where you get into an incident

764
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,240
and why don't we have DHCP records for

765
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,090
for this for this host and then some guy

766
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,160
says oh yeah I found that like three

767
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,760
months ago

768
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,520
great why don't you why don't you you

769
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,720
know report that well it wasn't an

770
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,090
incident this is a great way to like

771
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,150
identify those things and then report

772
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,340
them across the team and if you think

773
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,980
that we're just over complicating this I

774
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,710
really want to know that we scoured when

775
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,210
people were asking us the question like

776
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,890
how do you actually report and track

777
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,130
these we couldn't find an example I

778
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,320
think the the most the closest thing

779
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,240
that we could find was actually the the

780
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,670
endgame book that came in the giveaway

781
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,910
bags and on page 18 there

782
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,900
a little paragraph on metrics and the

783
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,160
importance of doing this but there's no

784
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,450
actual how you would do it specifically

785
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,819
and if you want to start simpler we're

786
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,170
gonna also give you a like a word

787
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,059
document in an Excel document I'm gonna

788
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:15,579
go ahead and say don't use this like if

789
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,619
you don't want to work JIRA and you just

790
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,210
have nightmares about JIRA there's a lot

791
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,789
of people are really religiously against

792
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:24,970
JIRA and this might be an easier way to

793
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,770
start it's just basically broken out by

794
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,410
tabs and allows you to kind of visualize

795
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,940
and then maybe you just develop this in

796
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,130
your internal process workflow tool yeah

797
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,789
so closing thoughts here this is really

798
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:41,710
important to us but the specific tool is

799
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,079
not important planning is a common thing

800
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,579
here is if you fail to plan plan to fail

801
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,880
that's pretty good

802
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,770
but it's really not important as far as

803
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,299
in terms of what tool but what is

804
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,520
important is that you are doing it you

805
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,170
have to track it some way if you really

806
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,510
want these outcomes to resonate and and

807
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,940
to get value out of your hunting because

808
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,670
dread hunting is incredibly valuable not

809
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,220
just for the finding apt or evil but for

810
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,569
finding stupid and correcting that don't

811
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:16,150
let your hunt program get derailed right

812
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,640
you get funding to set up this hunt

813
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,920
program at the end of the day you have

814
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,329
to answer to someone and someone wants

815
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:25,240
to know what they're getting for their

816
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,579
investment the higher level Justins of

817
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,279
the world they scare me this is a good

818
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:35,049
way to keep them away and finally that's

819
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:38,020
where you can find our slides I've

820
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,020
posted those out there and I'm where we

821
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,180
gonna put the config same place okay so

822
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,760
the config will be there relatively soon

823
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,720
yeah any questions

824
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,609
Oh

825
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,220
do we have any tactics that we did so

826
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,439
[Music]

827
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:09,619
yeah are you saying I found this thing

828
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,439
and nobody's auctioning it because I

829
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,809
can't I can't convince them that it's a

830
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,400
big problem kind of it might get my

831
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,289
question right so that's where I would

832
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,779
use the framework right that's the value

833
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:28,339
of tying it back to whatever framework

834
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,199
you have because then you kind of use

835
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,479
management's words against them in that

836
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,279
case right like if you're gonna say that

837
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,109
we're gonna identify to the NIST CSF

838
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:38,660
well this thing that I found it's

839
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,630
hampering that right that that helped a

840
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,859
lot of the people that we were talking

841
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:45,859
to about this and I guess I would also

842
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:48,769
add that all stupid is not created equal

843
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:51,769
yeah right so they're stupid and then

844
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:55,400
there's stupid I worked at a large

845
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,019
corporation one time where we discovered

846
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:59,089
we had 3389 open on the Internet

847
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:05,049
that's stupid also really common yeah

848
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,190
so the question was it if you're gonna

849
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,540
start a throw hunting program

850
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,390
do you use miss CSF like as a baseline

851
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,750
right I only see the value in this CSF

852
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,329
and the top 20 to make it valuable for

853
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:39,339
the people that I'm reporting to not

854
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:41,619
necessarily something that I like I know

855
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:44,770
that a logon gap is a problem but I need

856
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,510
to communicate why that is a problem and

857
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,920
I'm gonna use our organizational

858
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,680
framework to like use the same language

859
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,530
so I if it's if it's something that your

860
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:59,099
organization does then yes good

861
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:59,580
yes it's oh I see we were saying so

862
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,660
yeah absolutely

863
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,070
how do you do that absolutely so the

864
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,440
hunt hypothesis that means there's a

865
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,150
production level thing that we can

866
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,490
actually go do repeatedly right I might

867
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,830
want to wait two weeks a month to let

868
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,600
the data build right so that it's useful

869
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
to go back and search through that but

870
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,160
hopefully I've done 90% of the work so

871
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,680
that all I do is hey and that's a really

872
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,780
good way to put a junior person on that

873
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,410
right have your junior person execute a

874
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,150
predefined thing and then have like a

875
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,860
senior person kind of double-check their

876
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,320
work but meanwhile the senior person is

877
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,960
is crafting the next hypothesis so if

878
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:13,150
that hasn't been moved yeah I mean you

879
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,620
wouldn't want it just to be used like ad

880
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,350
hoc right you'd want to schedule it like

881
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,960
you can auto schedule activities in JIRA

882
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,410
so you could say generate a to-do

883
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,960
hunting activity in two weeks for this

884
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,660
production level hypothesis I know this

885
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,190
is getting kind of in the weeds but you

886
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,050
can do this you can say like we need to

887
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,760
wait two weeks for the data build up and

888
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,460
will generate a to-do action we'll

889
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,380
assign it to the available hunter and

890
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,470
then they'll just go do it right but you

891
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,450
should always like you this builds on

892
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,220
top of it and you would never just

893
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,860
forget about this original hypothesis

894
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,480
unless you turned it into an analytic

895
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,440
so the the hypothesis and the formation

896
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,579
of sorry I'm dying more water but yeah

897
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,440
you want to take that so in my

898
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,079
experience what I think has been

899
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,190
successful is I hate to like pigeonhole

900
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,839
people into like if you have sake

901
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,369
analysts being like you know this is

902
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:35,690
what you do you're looking at alerts all

903
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,359
day long I think if you have a

904
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:40,539
structured process it helps with

905
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:43,279
developing junior analysts so you know

906
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:44,839
if you go through some sort of rotation

907
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:46,130
we're like you're spending some time in

908
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,599
the sock and then you know now you've

909
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,609
got time to hunt I think it's a good way

910
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:52,099
to build your team the answer your

911
00:43:52,099 --> 00:44:09,769
question absolutely there's the so you

912
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:11,239
could add that to the workflow very

913
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:13,730
easily yeah you could say like needs

914
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:19,779
approval that kind of thing yeah good

915
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,610
yep so that that's a really good

916
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,710
question it's iterative right like

917
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,170
you're you're developing the hypothesis

918
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,360
you actually might find more outcomes

919
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,310
developing the hypothesis than you would

920
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,990
actually doing the activity right

921
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,850
because you're well we got to collect

922
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,450
RTP logs right we don't have those we

923
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,130
need to you know log that right so you

924
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,510
will find a lot in just constructing the

925
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,470
hypothesis itself

926
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:35,370
yes yes

927
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:52,479
we might have to talk more I want to

928
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:53,619
kind of clarify your question a little

929
00:45:53,619 --> 00:46:10,619
bit but yeah yeah yeah

930
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:33,420
uh kind of I we could probably I can go

931
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,930
into detail about this you just tired a

932
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,849
hypothesis right you've created an alert

933
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:42,030
you just note that you've you're

934
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,740
retiring the hypothesis and it roller

935
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,140
relates to this alert now that's in in

936
00:46:46,140 --> 00:47:06,000
our sim and you know right exactly and

937
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,349
that's something that we track right but

938
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,040
there's one of the five example out like

939
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,880
n states of a hunting activity her

940
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,820
outcome one was detection created that's

941
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,580
honestly that's what you want right

942
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,810
hopefully you don't find terrible and

943
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,640
you kick off an incident although you

944
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,880
know you will but hopefully you're

945
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,710
feeding your sock right a really good

946
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:36,380
hunting program is feeding the sock yes

947
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,380
so I haven't an answer but I'd ask you

948
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,289
to challenge you on this sure so for me

949
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,900
I mean it's not when it's done right so

950
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,019
like times that we've put in up here

951
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,559
it's super vague in general it's like

952
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:19,729
here's a week this is kind of we'd split

953
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,079
it up I think it's better to think of

954
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:23,960
that as more of percentage so like

955
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,489
hypothesis I think you're typically

956
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:29,059
going to spend 60% of your time on the

957
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:31,009
actual hunt you know it's going to be

958
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,170
somewhere around 20 to 25% that that's

959
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,910
just typical and go from there but it's

960
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:40,160
hard to say like you have to get really

961
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,079
you have to get really specific on your

962
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,390
scope right because the problem is you

963
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,799
don't know what you don't know you're

964
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:47,930
gonna find things that are gonna talk

965
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,509
more questions and and you know the

966
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:54,130
whole iteration problem

967
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:20,359
so I would say here that it's it's

968
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:22,460
really not so much about the the time in

969
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,470
that case it's making sure that you

970
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,510
develop a good hypothesis that allows

971
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,579
you to feel good about the answer or

972
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:29,990
conclusion that you get too so you know

973
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,540
like once you've executed that search

974
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,069
like okay this is going to tell me what

975
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:36,170
I need so either I found it or I didn't

976
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,349
but like your hypothesis is complete

977
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,089
enough so that when you do that you feel

978
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:42,950
comfortable saying we're done here

979
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,599
I wouldn't say that you would go into a

980
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,940
hunting activity without knowing how

981
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,160
long it would take that makes any sense

982
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,140
like you have done the scoping and the

983
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,089
hypothesis so that you know that this

984
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,220
would take about a day or two if that

985
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,329
makes any sense it'd be really rarely

986
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,609
like whoa we have just like tons of RDP

987
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:01,250
logs or just all these random blogs and

988
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,319
I now had to have to piece together that

989
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:15,619
works done in the hypothesis yeah how

990
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:29,180
far back your logs go yeah it's a

991
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,250
balance but if I haven't searched

992
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,020
something before I want to search it but

993
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,000
like you know to your point maybe you

994
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,380
don't have the time to go back two years

995
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,240
if you've got logs going back two years

996
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,460
though good for you and I'd search it if

997
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,049
I at the time yeah you have to identify

998
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:43,609
the bucket of equity that you're gonna

999
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:45,530
do it in first right so I'm gonna fit

1000
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,480
all this work into two days so what is

1001
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,640
reasonable right what can I do in a

1002
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,020
reasonable amount of time and that's

1003
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,510
dependent on you know an organization's

1004
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:59,770
logs right yeah

1005
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,700
and that's why the documentation of this

1006
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,049
whole process is so important because

1007
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:10,740
now you can go to this and say okay Jeff

1008
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,049
conducted this hunt on this date and

1009
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:15,780
this was the his scope so you can rule

1010
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,460
that in or out of this new hunt that

1011
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,190
you're conducting right so this is why

1012
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:25,790
documenting this is crucial yes sir

1013
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,250
okay so there's a lot of parts of that

1014
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,600
question so the first thing is like for

1015
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,330
me as someone that's sort of trained an

1016
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,500
incident response it's all about

1017
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,650
priorities so if I'm on a hunt right and

1018
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,070
I find like active c2 activity coming

1019
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,190
from a PT whatever that's my priority

1020
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,310
now okay I have an active intrusion that

1021
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,420
needs to be dealt with so that's where

1022
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,280
my my resources and time are going to go

1023
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,700
when you get into okay you you identify

1024
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,280
this and you're saying you don't have

1025
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,410
the capability to sort of respond to

1026
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:16,270
that threat call Mandy yeah I would I

1027
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,400
would honestly say that if you're if you

1028
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,960
don't have a really strong Incident

1029
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,670
Response process that it that it's

1030
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,170
really well-defined and you know what

1031
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,360
your action is then you're not ready to

1032
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:25,870
do this

1033
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,420
honestly it you need to have that those

1034
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,820
kind of foundations to do something like

1035
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,100
this so hunting is tossing around right

1036
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,590
and it's a new hotness but it takes a

1037
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,020
lot of work and it takes a lot of really

1038
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,600
advanced personnel right and just to add

1039
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,120
on here the the thing is is that I think

1040
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,820
there's a lot of for people that have a

1041
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,100
lot of experience in this there's a lot

1042
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,590
of fear about you know the boogeyman the

1043
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,690
apt and how serious it is all that but

1044
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,300
like your incident response processes

1045
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,770
and procedures they're going to be the

1046
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,340
same right so it's like detect contain

1047
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,000
respond like on some way shape or form

1048
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,830
that's how you're going to respond to

1049
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,510
two threats on your network so it's like

1050
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,130
I'd recommend hiring people that they

1051
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,370
you trust to be able to you know carry

1052
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:16,270
those

1053
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,850
tivities out like said if you can't then

1054
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,400
maybe you need to to find outside help

1055
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,970
but like ultimately it doesn't matter

1056
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,800
really if it's commodity or if it's a PT

1057
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,510
you have to have some sort of process

1058
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,670
and procedure in place to respond to to

1059
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,690
things like this and we're throwing

1060
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,790
around a PT a lot I mean what we're

1061
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,080
really finding right is like malware

1062
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,670
that's it's not being caught by a

1063
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,300
traditional tools

1064
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,050
hey you want to rabbit hole - just fine

1065
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:19,060
try to figure out how many like DNS

1066
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,369
servers you have right I mean yeah

1067
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:29,250
any other question sweet

1068
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,800
thank you thank you very much

1069
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,690
[Applause]
