1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,710
thank you very another 18 minutes left

2
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,380
it's a quick point did anyone see talk

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,050
here the room

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,420
well I always hate going to see some

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,640
talk right before mine because I get a

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,779
little bit self-conscious especially if

7
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,220
it's somewhat hidden I feel like this is

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,050
a 20-minute hot light of what he just

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,590
took about a little bit different here

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,570
for the two that we're here so but

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,960
Michael Wiley I run my own need for the

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,960
routine year and I just sold it

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,160
Ritchie solutions stuff transit and the

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,860
director of cyber security services that

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,950
I did penetration testing blue teaming

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,660
building cybersecurity programs for

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,670
organizations mostly out of California

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,960
being in cyber security I think I did

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
about twenty different specific last two

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,909
years they were pouring through rings

21
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,140
clock EGR steep opening to and we're

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,670
really building up so this a we're a

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,940
long I impress it now down into what 17

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,400
minutes left a little bit more of

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,940
instance it's some different frameworks

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,950
but can don't like but the one thing I

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,549
wanted to take away from this is a quote

28
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,070
preventing problems is often less costly

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,290
and more effective than than reacting to

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:53,380
them after they occur a

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,200
the goals it he took or story that he

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,810
gave me was pretty thing and so what he

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,479
did he did a penetration test he had his

34
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,549
report that went over at the client and

35
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,799
one of the patients he gave out was you

36
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:12,560
need to have HTTP website and of course

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,239
this was an e-commerce website so you

38
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,620
would thought they already had that but

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,830
they didn't and the business owner or

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,599
the management team didn't understand

41
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,730
why is it it's gonna cost me money why

42
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,230
should I do that well here's the

43
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,480
security reasons you mean Shan you

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,340
protect cardholder data except

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,040
but what is he gonna do for me and so he

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,510
finally to go back and think about that

47
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,400
and look at the business case and say

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,799
well okay if you do HGPS

49
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,689
Google's gonna give you a higher ranking

50
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,129
you're gonna get best better SEO

51
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,290
immediately said put let's put these

52
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,640
three people on it let's do this right

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,620
away so he had to start changing the way

54
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,870
he wrote these reports and aligning some

55
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,829
of the things that he did with the

56
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,360
business goals rather than just security

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,720
and I wanted to take this the

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,470
presentation here and give a little more

59
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,659
high-level and help some of you in your

60
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,519
organization's present some of these

61
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,230
topics especially around Incident

62
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,109
Response and defense to management

63
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,700
especially senior management who might

64
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,530
not understand the importance of what

65
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,269
we're doing and I'm passionate about

66
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,459
technology and security and so I love

67
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,170
sitting there spinning up new servers

68
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,239
security tools i coming Alize

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,470
conferences and i go home and spend

70
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,000
hours and hours playing with this stuff

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,889
but unless we have the business case and

72
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,540
we can align it with business goals it's

73
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,510
very hard to to sell that and so I have

74
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,060
an MBA I spent two and a half years

75
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,280
doing a lot of business cases and SWOT

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,650
analysis and so I might be able to help

77
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,690
you with some of that track position or

78
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,299
bridge the gap between business and what

79
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,340
we do as far as security so we're going

80
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,720
to talk a little bit of business goals

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,760
be able to demonstrate relevance to

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,190
management high highlight some finds in

83
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,650
recent cases you look up these studies

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,799
give you some ammo and look at some of

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,690
the Incident Response budgeting okay and

86
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,010
so the one thing I've seen as far as

87
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,489
some trends before and this isn't that

88
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,680
far in the past a couple of years ago

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,799
even we saw and the the on the book I'd

90
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,599
this all came from Harvard Business

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,250
Review so they looked at a couple of the

92
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,750
different breaches and they looked at

93
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,859
the crisis before during and after their

94
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:13,760
breaches and they kind of looked at what

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,949
happened so Home Depot had a 21%

96
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:19,399
increase in its not events per second it

97
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,630
is anyone know earning per share you get

98
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,150
a book see I remember to do one of these

99
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,490
okay and then by the end of February

100
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,150
2014 target had the highest percent

101
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,030
stock price regain in five years that

102
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,940
they saw 2014 Sears after their breach

103
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,520
stock

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
price rose after the the breach

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,849
announcement as well it was a steady

106
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,340
increase after that and nine million

107
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,699
dollars of target's breach related costs

108
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,199
were covered by a cyber insurance so it

109
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,330
was a lot of like push it off or how is

110
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,560
it really going to impact us everyone

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,840
we're talking about reputation loss but

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,129
then we're seeing well if there's

113
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,620
reputation loss why is the value of

114
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,000
their stock in the company going up

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,159
after this and so I saw a lot of this

116
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,060
and it was a little bit troubling

117
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,639
troubling to me in the past and now what

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm seeing is more of in the recent

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,780
years just in the last year or two even

120
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,400
that we're seeing ok maybe it's not

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,889
reputation loss but there's some other

122
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,840
quantifiable metrics that we can use as

123
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,250
far as harm to the company so 2018

124
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,289
recently uber paid or is projected to

125
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:28,289
pay a record 148 million dollar for

126
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:29,789
concealing their data breach all right

127
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:30,780
so they didn't do what they were

128
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,400
supposed to they had a big data breach

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,419
and now they have to pay a bunch of

130
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,810
fines 2018 Facebook this is again it

131
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,789
could but they're supposed to face out

132
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,400
100 or sorry 1.6 3 billion dollars in

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,930
fines for the gdpr breach that they had

134
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,680
or violating gdpr dozen 18 Atlanta paid

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
1 or 2.6 million

136
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,310
apparently that's equaling up and if you

137
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,169
were at Jake Williams talk but he talked

138
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,240
a lot about that to cover from

139
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,150
ransomware breach 2016 yahoo had to pay

140
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,889
and this one was interesting because it

141
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,319
wasn't a fine and it wasn't a loss of

142
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,880
reputation but they actually had to

143
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,639
write a check for 350 million dollars to

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,590
Verizon because they didn't do the right

145
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,090
thing they didn't announce it in time

146
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,340
and there was a lost reputation so I

147
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,419
don't know how they come up with that

148
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,069
figure but they had to give them a check

149
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,259
for 350 million dollars to say basically

150
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,650
sorry we did bad ok and so I like to

151
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,759
give this scenario when I talked about

152
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,020
Incident Response and I think this helps

153
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,669
when you talk in your management or

154
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,229
executives and not just talking about

155
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,099
the nerd stuff that we so much but give

156
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,389
them a little bit of a scenario on what

157
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,740
this is like and so I use this as

158
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,150
illustration for students when I teach

159
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,060
as well as for executives and I was

160
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,550
gonna change this because I realize if

161
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,440
you're from Georgia a prominent as from

162
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,990
the earth earthquakes as I am right but

163
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,550
as I was gonna change it sometimes when

164
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,620
I go to different regions or areas just

165
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,169
the scenario but in this case I

166
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,729
thinking about it on my way here and I

167
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,379
don't know what to do for a hurricane so

168
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,430
I can't really help you there's you're

169
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,050
gonna have to try and and think about

170
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,270
this from the high scenario you take

171
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,590
your family California it's a business

172
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,319
trip and your family sightseeing they're

173
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,999
on the Hollywood or Sunset Strip they're

174
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:09,960
taking a look at the different things

175
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,779
the Stars and whatnot and then middle of

176
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,479
the day there's a major earthquake and

177
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,430
you're at the clients office or a

178
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,710
conference room and they're out on the

179
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,710
strip and you you think what am I going

180
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,029
to do I want to check out my family make

181
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,099
sure they're okay and if you didn't plan

182
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,139
this out I kind of go through this this

183
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,210
essentially a tabletop scenario with

184
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,460
some of my clients so in California the

185
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,779
past in Northridge so we had a big

186
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,069
earthquake some of the roads did

187
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,729
collapse water pipes were bursting the

188
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,289
supermarkets were sold out of certain

189
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,050
foods and water and cellphone towers

190
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,659
were not working quite well so if you

191
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,849
think about that how do you communicate

192
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:50,370
if the cell towers are down and I

193
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,419
started think about this as well for

194
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,759
myself of okay if the cell towers go

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,240
down I there's hardly no landlines left

196
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,319
so I'm not gonna be able to call my

197
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,740
family I have a ham radio but my wife

198
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,060
doesn't know how to use it and we

199
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,319
haven't talked about what tower we're

200
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,969
gonna use or frequency or anything like

201
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,729
that if I want to start driving or you

202
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,860
wouldn't drive to your family or whoever

203
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,810
you're trying to get to if the roads are

204
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,509
collapsed or if ways doesn't work or

205
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,460
Google Maps don't work it's a little bit

206
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,219
challenging I even thought about this

207
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,349
most recently because my wife's pregnant

208
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:23,430
and we were thinking about well there's

209
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,210
an emergency

210
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,550
where's the nearest hospital and so I

211
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,349
googled it but besides googling it I

212
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,810
didn't know how to get there or the

213
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,279
directions so some of these things we

214
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,229
take technology for granted and helps us

215
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,750
in our everyday lives but we also it can

216
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,760
potentially be an issue in a disaster

217
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,940
situation do you have the skills for my

218
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,370
first aid right I can obviously Google

219
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,810
or YouTube how to put a tourniquet on

220
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,550
but if I've never done that or practiced

221
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,720
it or seen you in doing it's probably

222
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
not the best for me just to figure that

223
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,170
out on the spot and then if you're

224
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,630
thirsty do you have water in your car do

225
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,029
you you keep these things nearby in your

226
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,350
house do you have anything I know they

227
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,269
say well you can go to the toilet bowl

228
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,100
and you can drink water out of that but

229
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,420
has anyone looked at their toilet bowl

230
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,819
recently the tank of it might have some

231
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,519
like reddish orange color to it I don't

232
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,300
know what's in

233
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,220
don't want to really drink that and if

234
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,870
you're hungry obviously we have food and

235
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,100
refrigerator but what if it's the day

236
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,200
before grocery day or what if then

237
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,970
because the pipes burst McDonald's is

238
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,710
closed or chick-fil-a I guess out here

239
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,140
is really popular so you can't really

240
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,730
get food in that case you have sometimes

241
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,110
we talked about this with your family

242
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,300
and this is even prompt me in my own

243
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,520
livestock with my family of I want to go

244
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,960
see if they're okay but what if they're

245
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
coming to see if I'm okay and we can't

246
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,010
call each other so not having a plan set

247
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,690
forth and really just saying well if

248
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,400
that happens we'll deal with it it can

249
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,930
end up costing us a lot more in the

250
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,030
future and I think having a snare pair

251
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,110
like this will help you talk to

252
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,010
management if they don't really

253
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,540
understand the technological part of

254
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,460
instant response but give them something

255
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,720
they can relate to and maybe change

256
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,310
earthquake if you're from Georgia to

257
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,720
something you could relate to but for me

258
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,780
it's an earthquake okay and I can kind

259
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,300
of then transition that into a scenario

260
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
that they might actually see and so this

261
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,930
was a case that I worked on Incident

262
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,820
Response for a post production house in

263
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,570
the Los Angeles area one of the the

264
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,250
colourists ends up calling and report an

265
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,680
incident it was a senior editor that

266
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,140
finished a large blockbuster film you

267
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,400
can imagine it was like five hundred

268
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,280
million dollar production and they said

269
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,830
the mouth started moving and then they

270
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,840
saw that the project inside the editor

271
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,420
tool closed down a different project

272
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,880
ended up opening up the editor didn't

273
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,740
really they didn't have it had an

274
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,570
instant response plan but obviously no

275
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,760
one really read that the plug on the

276
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,280
system

277
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,320
um and so they ended up calling sound

278
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,580
saying key take a look at this we want

279
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,230
to figure out was this did the next

280
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,270
blockbuster but we just packed is it

281
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,550
gonna be on Pirate Bay tomorrow we was

282
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,200
this just a glitch what really happened

283
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,000
here and so we came out to look at it

284
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,380
and so in this scenario if you're

285
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,520
thinking this through talking with your

286
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,670
executive do we have advance logging and

287
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,200
in this case no there was no advance

288
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,820
logging there was no record of pretty

289
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,610
much anything that was happening they

290
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,770
had free version of some type of net

291
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,240
flow or s flow so we could see some

292
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
transactions but it was only reporting

293
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,300
up to an hour so by the time we got

294
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,950
there there was no gate it left there to

295
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,380
no packet capture on the network no

296
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,050
central log system the users weren't

297
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,790
trained to preserve all town memory so

298
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,560
they thought something's going on let me

299
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,060
just pull the plug and then we lost a

300
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,090
lot of data there the B and C it was

301
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,590
installed on every system

302
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,360
the network without any type of logging

303
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,160
and of course they had the same password

304
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,610
for the last 15 or 20 years so we really

305
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,020
couldn't figure much out there either

306
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,510
there was no baselines of any systems

307
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,280
networks or how they should look or how

308
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,660
they shouldn't look so it's very

309
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,430
difficult and so coming back to this

310
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,140
maybe you can play a scenario like this

311
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,880
to management or senior management or

312
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,070
even your supervisor up through the

313
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,140
disaster national disaster that they can

314
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,090
relate to and then something else like

315
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,740
this it's maybe somewhat relevant and

316
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,630
talk about all these things could happen

317
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,600
and then doing these and sometimes when

318
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,060
I do tabletop exercises anyone let me

319
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,760
get a hands up if anyone's done tabletop

320
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,940
exercises be a few people is anyone done

321
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,580
it ransomware tabletop exercise a couple

322
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,290
and for those couple people that have

323
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,710
done that have you discussed in that

324
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,440
tabletop exercise who makes the decision

325
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,580
if you pay the ransom anyone you do that

326
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,380
two of them that's good a lot of times

327
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,000
when we go through that scenario people

328
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,530
don't even think of that it's kind of

329
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,570
quiet in the room they say well we

330
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,070
thought about ransomware that's in the

331
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,240
news everywhere but we never really

332
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,620
thought about who's gonna pay that at

333
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,270
that point or who's gonna make that

334
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,830
decision and if we only have 24 hours

335
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,880
what's gonna happen okay so I gotta I'm

336
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,170
gonna kind of skip through these since

337
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,390
we briefly spoke and a little short on

338
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,330
time so I pulled this the statistic

339
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,880
appear of data breaches purposely didn't

340
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,920
want to grab numbers or dollar numbers

341
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,690
but I wanted to pull records since these

342
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,830
single it'll be a little more accurate

343
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,720
so these are a bunch of big data

344
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,520
breaches that happened recently and the

345
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,840
number of records that were stolen

346
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,720
obviously Yahoo has that giant line

347
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
above everyone else we can still see the

348
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,460
others are in the millions as well so my

349
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,020
biggest issue and it's kind of us back

350
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,400
what Jake just spoke about in the other

351
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,890
room is that with some of these breach

352
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,530
statistics how do you quantify the

353
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,010
impact of the breach right so we'll see

354
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,240
they'll say we've we've had spending

355
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,850
dollars spent we've spent this much time

356
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,130
we'd do whatever but it's kind of

357
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,770
different depending on who you ask and

358
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,080
so so quantifying reputation as well

359
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,460
let's say we have lost a reputation in

360
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,590
the past I didn't have these fines that

361
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,810
I could bring to the CEOs or CIOs or

362
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,280
CISOs to say this is what it's gonna

363
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,990
cost you or has cost people in the past

364
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,540
but they'd say ok what reputation we get

365
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,570
if we if we leak the new Marvel or

366
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,340
Disney or Netflix or whatever film were

367
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,490
working on or if we have 50 million

368
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,620
credit cards that are stolen sub yes we

369
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,140
have reputation harm but going back to

370
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,790
some of the other data there our stock

371
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,560
price might actually still go up it's

372
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,790
not really gonna do that much of

373
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,170
reputation and we can't really measure

374
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,500
that regulations on reporting breaches

375
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,990
are fairly new and unclear so gdpr if

376
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,190
anyone's how to deal with that there's a

377
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,170
lot of questions and ambiguity with that

378
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,480
and then the new California consumer

379
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,860
Privacy Act if you're doing any business

380
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,830
in California that one is one of my

381
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,290
favorites there's missing sentences like

382
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,000
the census just stopped and the laws

383
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,650
that they've passed so you don't really

384
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,880
even know where they're going with some

385
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,330
of that stuff and so they also have some

386
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,950
of the privacy laws and the breach laws

387
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,500
are now having reasonably likely to

388
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,630
cause harm and I'll show you a couple of

389
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,430
slides on that and it coming up here but

390
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,740
there's also some discretion on the

391
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,930
company of was did we really think

392
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,430
someone did this or if they stole the

393
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,440
laptop could they really have seen the

394
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,660
data on it we're gonna say no and not

395
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,230
report it we also see that the media

396
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,890
figures there there's no vetting to it

397
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,940
I've clicked through some of these

398
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,010
different articles on whether it was the

399
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,960
Atlanta data breach or the Yahoo and

400
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,690
it's these reports that here a number

401
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,370
and if you just look at the Atlanta data

402
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,110
breach and what it cost you'll find

403
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,430
numbers anywhere from a million to

404
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,320
seventeen million dollars and that's a

405
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,180
little bit of a gap between there and

406
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,220
sometimes I'll see articles and I look

407
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,600
at the date and then the amount they're

408
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,370
reporting and they're still all over the

409
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,510
place so I don't know where these people

410
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,650
are getting the figures they will

411
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,510
they'll cite someone else or some other

412
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,340
article then that you go there and that

413
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,510
one cites some other they're kind of

414
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,860
like citing each other and this this

415
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,090
vicious circle thresholds and off you

416
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,190
station get out of jail Creek free card

417
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,870
so some states and I'll show you a

418
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,030
picture on that coming up as well that

419
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,370
there's certain states that if you don't

420
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,750
hit a certain threshold of records that

421
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,820
you've had or you've off you skated them

422
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,310
or encrypted them and those terms are

423
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,130
very vague as well so if you off you

424
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,140
skate the data or truncated so if you

425
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,670
take the last digit off your social

426
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,050
security number is that still for each

427
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,910
do they still have to report that that's

428
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,240
not the true record and then most of the

429
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,800
statistics are based off of energies the

430
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,320
interviews

431
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,850
large corpora so you say what's the

432
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,590
average cost of a ransomware incident

433
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,110
well you look at what survey they're

434
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,170
citing and it was fortune 500s or it was

435
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,510
the fortune 500 that got breached or

436
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,040
whatever that was and it's not the

437
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,630
smaller companies so it's not true data

438
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,430
that they have out there and then it's

439
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,460
also biased and Jake just talked a lot

440
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,020
about this but there's a lot of reasons

441
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,010
to under report or over report on this

442
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,510
couple different things so I did a lot

443
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,900
of research on the financial sector and

444
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,030
breaches because I found for CBS this

445
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,610
year and tax software so if you use a

446
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,690
CPA there's a good chance that your data

447
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,130
is flying across and clear text on the

448
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,270
network so I've reported those the

449
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,590
vendors and they're still working on it

450
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,120
from the beginning of this year so I

451
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,130
thought well I want to see if there's

452
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,350
what people are reporting on as far as

453
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,390
breaches in California because we have

454
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,280
this new California consumer Privacy Act

455
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,470
and a few years ago they revised another

456
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,840
breach notification law that talked

457
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,850
about you have to submit the Year

458
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,740
breaches to a database and so I found

459
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,910
some interesting things when I searched

460
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,890
every single breach record that I could

461
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,960
find relating to tax and CPA in the

462
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,750
California database we saw statements

463
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,240
like we found unauthorized access to our

464
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,390
secured network okay well if it was so

465
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,400
secured how did you get breached and why

466
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,660
are you reporting your breach in this

467
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,109
database

468
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,209
the attacker managed to hack into our

469
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,619
computer systems despite these a

470
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,260
firewall and antivirus okay so it's

471
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,589
still not secure though backup hard

472
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,089
drive was stolen though they require a

473
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,280
proprietary softer for files to be

474
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,349
readable okay you can use strings

475
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,640
against that or you can download the

476
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,010
free trial and still get that stuff we

477
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,870
take aggressive steps to protect your

478
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,430
information to ensure all records are

479
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,830
securely locked the data was not secure

480
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,600
locked it was unencrypted and therefore

481
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,650
you had to report it if it was even

482
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,570
encrypted or truncated or off you stated

483
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,310
you didn't even have to report this so

484
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,660
even though we have these laws of

485
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,280
regulations coming out as far as breach

486
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,020
notifications we're still seeing a lot

487
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,980
of business they're trying to protect

488
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,170
their reputation them elves and they're

489
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,390
not really accurately reporting the

490
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,890
information they have they're trying to

491
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,450
skew it so it doesn't look like they're

492
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,540
so bad okay couple quick case studies

493
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,590
I'm going to breeze through these since

494
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,810
I'm almost out of time

495
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,520
Yahoo they had two different breaches if

496
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,960
you weren't aware one of them was a

497
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,910
smaller one only 500 million

498
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,560
curds and then the larger one was the

499
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,850
three billion that made a lot of news

500
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,350
and this is one of the first ones that

501
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,260
we saw real tangible quantifiable

502
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,670
numbers out of this and so we saw that

503
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,860
I'm gonna skip over to the next slide so

504
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,020
we can see those we saw that they had

505
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,030
the sec actually find them they stepped

506
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,920
in and said we're gonna find you thirty

507
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,390
five million dollars for failure to

508
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,010
promptly report so you didn't let

509
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,480
everyone know about this breach in time

510
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,880
and then Verizon also took a check from

511
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,640
them for 350 million dollars because the

512
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,590
lot lack of reputation or that they

513
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,880
didn't let them know about some of this

514
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,310
during due diligence the Atlanta

515
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,990
ransomware incident obviously earlier

516
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,880
this year they had multiple people

517
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,830
involved with this a lot of this could

518
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,690
have been fixed they had SMB version one

519
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,910
in public facing servers this was all

520
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,760
reported from security researchers they

521
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,470
had a lot of people involved and so this

522
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,140
is one I'm still digging for a lot more

523
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,880
information on the Atlanta one the

524
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,010
reason I'm interested on government

525
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,270
agencies because they have to report

526
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,800
more than the private sector does and

527
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,690
they're a little bit a little bit more

528
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,760
held to that standard and so we can

529
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,740
actually see that broken down so rather

530
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,680
than Yahoo saying we had to spend all

531
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,270
this money and we have no idea what that

532
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,550
is at least with this Atlanta one we can

533
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,410
see break down who they paid and how

534
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,940
much we don't know exactly what they did

535
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,910
so you had an MS SP come in for $60,000

536
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,980
well what exactly do they do they

537
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,510
augment the staff how long were they

538
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,280
there we don't see those invoices but at

539
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,050
least we can see that they're $60,000

540
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,360
and sure we file for a request we might

541
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,590
be able to have access to a little bit

542
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,090
more of this but we could see that they

543
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,880
had PR companies come in Cisco from

544
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,800
malware reverse engineering they had

545
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,020
SecureWorks come in Ian why come in for

546
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,570
instant response and then this one is

547
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,890
well this is probably one of the first

548
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,750
ones there's debate between a couple

549
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,000
different companies but voya financial

550
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,190
they're a top 25 broker in the u.s. so

551
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,340
if you think of like one of your online

552
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,000
trading companies they have four $418

553
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,310
net assets but they were finding 1

554
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,930
million dollars from the SEC this is one

555
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,100
of the first times that we've seen a

556
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,320
fine from the SEC just for the breach

557
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,360
not for failure to report on time but

558
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,300
just for an actual breach ok and then

559
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,290
this is another part that's really

560
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,050
interesting is privacy laws we're seeing

561
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,640
a lot of them come in that are actually

562
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,110
having quantifiable laws so in

563
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,180
California 2020 if you're doing any

564
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,980
business with us in California

565
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,809
or have any residents in California

566
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:21,190
there's a couple different thresholds

567
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,900
but we're seeing that there's actual

568
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,210
quantifiable fines for every record that

569
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,730
you have breached or every violation GDP

570
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,440
are tons of money that people are

571
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,150
getting fine for that as well and in the

572
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,860
past it was really just the Attorney

573
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,020
General could sue your company or file a

574
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,090
lawsuit if you didn't follow the law but

575
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,110
now we're actually seeing a physical

576
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,809
dollar amount and these laws and we can

577
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,270
see that a lot of different states

578
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,700
almost every single state here is has an

579
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,640
electronic breach laws some of them are

580
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,010
also paper some of them do have with

581
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,010
harm threshold so if you have a certain

582
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,260
number of Records or if there's no harm

583
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,510
or reasonable assumption of harm then

584
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,120
you don't have to report and then we see

585
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,890
a lot of other laws that are industry

586
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,419
specific so if you're in health care and

587
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,929
other areas okay it's my last slide here

588
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,809
lessons learned um so what we saw is

589
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:11,890
that there's high tangible cost

590
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,909
associated with some of these incidents

591
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,440
whether to pay a ransom

592
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,390
you have the IR consultants and you come

593
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,490
in breach notices regulatory fines and

594
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,559
these are all increasing we see that

595
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,210
incidents could have been prevented at a

596
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,710
lower cost if you would have done little

597
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,480
bit better defense and then breaches

598
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,220
need to be reported promptly and if

599
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,779
they're not we're starting to see a lot

600
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,600
more of the customers and laws come into

601
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,250
place that are now forcing businesses to

602
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,840
do this and so sometimes it's even in a

603
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,640
contract that says we will not do

604
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,140
business with you unless you have

605
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,909
incident response and all these defenses

606
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,059
in place so that is for the the slides

607
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:45,309
it was a quick 20 minute truncated

608
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,799
version of my longer talk if I hadn't

609
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,600
one has any questions I have two things

610
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,730
to hand out I already give one out so

611
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,970
questions and prize for the question

612
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,270
it's good yes yes

613
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:12,309
yeah

614
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,720
well it's funny to mention that because

615
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,640
I was thinking about that right before

616
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,560
the talk of like wow it's up to 15

617
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,840
million dollars I'm sorry yeah so the

618
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,630
question was my thoughts on her pay

619
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,670
should paid the ransom in the beginning

620
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,130
or is it good that the went ahead and

621
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,020
did their own instant response well they

622
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,510
were originally asking the the attackers

623
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,060
or adversaries were asking for I think

624
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,100
$50,000 so I think financially it would

625
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,570
have been better for them and that that

626
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,030
case to pay it my personal take on it is

627
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,920
do not negotiate with terrorists and we

628
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,590
see an increase 165 percent I think

629
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,150
increased somewhere around there and

630
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,330
ransomware in 2014 quarter-over-quarter

631
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,310
because people were paying it so I think

632
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,290
it encourages it but you're gonna have

633
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,700
to make their own decision within your

634
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,930
organization I can't tell you what's

635
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,400
right or wrong you know if you want to

636
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,480
come up I'll give you this one for that

637
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,580
question and the other question yeah

638
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,889
yep

639
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,740
yep

640
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,950
when I think I think because they

641
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,869
started if I remember correctly from the

642
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,659
timelines that I saw was that it was

643
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:38,509
taken away but they had already or

644
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,119
publicly talked about the the infant or

645
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,409
that they were not going to pay I don't

646
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,600
know which one it was but the city of

647
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,759
Atlanta talked about it before that and

648
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,249
then it was taken down after that any

649
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:53,679
other questions yes and back

650
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,270
yes

651
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,830
so the questions about cybersecurity

652
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,490
insurance and and how that's going so I

653
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,310
know with I think it was the Yahoo

654
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,050
incident that they ended up paying the

655
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,420
insurance paid ninety million out of the

656
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,220
couple hundred million or whatever it

657
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,680
was I think G his last talk was really

658
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,750
good on this as far as yeah if you

659
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,850
hadn't seen that the he talked about how

660
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,980
a lot of them aren't paying out exactly

661
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,900
I've seen some clauses that say you have

662
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,210
to be doing XYZ beforehand you have to

663
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,350
have do care and if you were negligent

664
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,940
there's certain things that don't fall

665
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,400
in that but I think that in the past

666
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,900
they were pushing it off on that they

667
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,100
were taking the risks and they were

668
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,990
transferring it to someone else but now

669
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,730
I don't think that's really fixing the

670
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,840
problems sometimes they're saying we're

671
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,030
not gonna pay the fines or we'll we'll

672
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,770
do it but you have a whatever million

673
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,500
dollar deductible and some things are

674
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,730
getting padded in there like Jake was

675
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,230
just talking about that shouldn't really

676
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,410
be in there so I would recommend cyber

677
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,630
insurance I just don't think it's the

678
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,800
solution you can't have no security and

679
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,450
then transfer the risk to someone else

680
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:13,740
thank you think he left so if you want

681
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,150
to come grab the book for your question

682
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,440
thank you very much appreciate it
