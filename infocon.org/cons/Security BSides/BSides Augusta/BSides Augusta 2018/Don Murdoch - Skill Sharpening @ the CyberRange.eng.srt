1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,209
alright ladies and gentlemen thank you

2
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:17,690
very much for coming to the

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,240
on adversary simulation this is what I

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,800
do every day at the Regent University

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,890
cyber range and I really want to explain

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,930
that our moat our focus and our

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,240
motivation is for our attendees to learn

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,210
all the things I have a teenager and he

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,430
told me that I had to have a mean so I

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,680
got learn all the thing apparently if I

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,690
don't have a meme I'm not I'm not in

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,470
vogue so Who am I

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,210
GIC I've written a fairly well-known

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,450
books yes the second book is bigger

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,520
because it's better

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,750
I've already had somebody complained

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,339
that I've triggered their OCD because

18
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,470
it's 7 by 10 instead of 6 by 9 and it

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,879
won't fit in their backpack and I'm like

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,850
well you know I'd like to tell you

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,199
something there are three kinds of

22
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:02,479
people on the internet and I got this

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,550
quote from Keith Palmgren who teaches

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,380
for the SANS Institute there are sheep

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,229
there are wolves and there are shepherds

26
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:15,409
and I really want to encourage you to be

27
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,720
a shepherd and that's what I am you know

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,810
25 years on i.t been around I was also

29
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,120
an emergency medical technician I found

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,560
in information security it is an

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,180
amazingly high percentage of people

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,050
who've done fire and EMS roughly 11% of

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,390
sans instructors have fire an EMS

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,130
background including Stephen Northman

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,700
himself

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,060
I'm senior designer and I will also make

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,670
an official announcement we do have two

38
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,110
more books in the blue team handbook

39
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,130
series on the way

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,659
[Applause]

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,970
thank you kindly very much I appreciate

42
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,820
that and if you have ideas oh by the way

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,479
I have three giveaways so at about when

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,190
we're done for about five minutes as I

45
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,490
go through this talk on add sim what I'd

46
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,979
like is for the first three people to

47
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,100
stand up and in Reader's Digest mode

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,038
share an adversary simulation success

49
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,690
story you guys are going to get the

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,250
prizes so it's it's going to be

51
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,380
Jackrabbit time at five minutes till the

52
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,030
end so our range is set up with four

53
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,550
classrooms arranged in five computer

54
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,950
pods and they can fight each other we

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,319
have a whole bunch of stuff and what I'm

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,390
going to go through is how we actually

57
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,400
do this the pass on is sure some good

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,230
lessons for you guys how we actually do

59
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,900
adversary simulation at the college and

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,660
we also focus on one thing we really

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,299
focus on after-action report I did

62
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,640
people around the whiteboard and I make

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,530
them talk about stuff and you'd be as

64
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,940
surprised the amount of learning that

65
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,209
you get through there's some lingo that

66
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,860
we have to be compliant with first thing

67
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,810
Gardner has now produced research within

68
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,870
the last five to six months on bas

69
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,630
breach and attack simulation and I'll

70
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,130
talk about that in a few minutes but we

71
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
want to think about the red team the

72
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,780
attacker side the red team is trying to

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,489
penetrate trying to go beneath the radar

74
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,769
and then we also have the blue team they

75
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,200
are the defenders in an adversary

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,170
simulation exercise in order to be

77
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,780
really successful you have to know how

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,910
to play both roles or have the right

79
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,489
people playing both roles and they

80
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:27,959
really have to have some good guide

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,850
books because the best situations that

82
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,400
I've experienced is when you play one

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,769
role and then you flip-flop to the next

84
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,930
role there's also some other key roles

85
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,489
in adversary simulation you have the

86
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,440
purple teaming concept becoming in vogue

87
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,820
nowadays it's kind of like what threat

88
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,790
hunting was to the in 2011 and then

89
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,730
there's also white and green the white

90
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,250
role in an adversary simulation is what

91
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,609
I do

92
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,950
they are the arbitrators they play the

93
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,030
role of what's called site personnel

94
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,859
when you think about doing an adversary

95
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,989
simulation environment and you're trying

96
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,160
to do something so you're going to come

97
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,170
with an ADD sim event at it besides

98
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,180
event or something like that somebody

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,730
has to be the expert to represent the

100
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,410
organization that is being penetrated

101
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,330
and that's the site personnel were land

102
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,820
that's white depending on who you are

103
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,000
you may also have a green role the green

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,070
role at least in the commercial sector

105
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,079
tends to be the person or person is

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,540
percentage that that word that's plural

107
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,360
of person they are the people who are

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,190
trying to make sure that you're doing a

109
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,870
good job so they are auditing the white

110
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,860
team so here if you've never seen a

111
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,970
Gartner trough this is a trough of

112
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,380
enlighten there so they have a phrase

113
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,440
for it breach an attack simulation is

114
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,290
very much at the innovation level it is

115
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,490
far-left

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,880
that actually has value to you folks out

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
there who are interested in adversary

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,690
simulation more vendors are going to

119
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,700
catch the term your Google search some

120
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,860
use searching is going to be better

121
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,540
you're going to be able to differentiate

122
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,420
folks there's now an anchor word where

123
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,310
we can actually talk about what this

124
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,070
phrase means okay so the Gartner

125
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,600
definition is tools that allow

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
enterprises to continuously and

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
essentially simulate the full attack

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,610
cycle including insider threats a lot of

129
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,530
a movement data exfiltration against

130
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,000
enterprise infrastructure using software

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,480
agents virtual machines and other means

132
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,570
I'll practice that just for you so the

133
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,940
whole idea is there are now products

134
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,160
available that weren't on the market a

135
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,080
few years ago I mean I think the oldest

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
company in this space is Sage safe

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,980
breach at something like three or four

138
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,650
years compare and contrast that to

139
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,910
Microsoft how long have they been in

140
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,730
business I don't know thirty thirty

141
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,710
years compare that to IBM how long have

142
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,320
they been in business before I was born

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,880
and I'm above 50 I want to say too far

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,760
above 50 so a search terms you'll be

145
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,520
able to get that for the for the over-40

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,650
crowd I had a dan Aykroyd picture I just

147
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,710
had to have in this slide adversary

148
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,410
simulation regardless of whether you're

149
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,080
doing an exercise at your organization

150
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,180
where you have red versus blue with

151
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,060
white involved has to answer critical

152
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,910
questions if you're not answering the

153
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,870
questions

154
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,000
and you're not going about the process

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,889
of building an adversary simulation

156
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,169
environment or buying a product either

157
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,540
way you're essentially wasting your time

158
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,760
I think because you really want to know

159
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,460
why you're doing this and the reason why

160
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,290
you have to know why you're doing this

161
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,330
is you're going to devote time energy

162
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,910
and money and you really want to be

163
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,940
achieving I'll learn to behavior outcome

164
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,350
in the people who are going to

165
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,780
participate this is not just going and

166
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,360
getting a walker of a von hoening system

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,400
this is figuring out how we can put

168
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,740
something on the network to either make

169
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,930
a test or make somebody sharper or

170
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,460
better or make yourself sharper or

171
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,660
better because we're talking about an

172
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,280
organized process so think about why are

173
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,410
you even thinking about doing this

174
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,570
either building scenarios or spending

175
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,460
money on a product what is the actual

176
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,919
problem you have to solve I have a list

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,110
of a number of open source projects out

178
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,880
there and I've spent some really good

179
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,139
time with a number of the people who

180
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,639
create these open source projects I'm

181
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,320
going to show you a few of them that

182
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,150
actually do this for you and you can go

183
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,310
pretty far down the road without

184
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,350
spending anything but a few afternoons

185
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,270
they be exciting afternoons because

186
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,300
you're gonna learn new tools okay what

187
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,979
does go how is this going to improve

188
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,789
your internal security posture show of

189
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,210
hands how many of you actually think you

190
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,340
have a documented internal security

191
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,260
posture I see one brave soul and I'm

192
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,760
legally blind so I'm only counting him

193
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,599
because the rest of you didn't weigh

194
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,060
violently you know what are you actually

195
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,419
testing and I have to tell you this

196
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,070
point right here that I'm highlighting

197
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,639
with my cool logitech thing people going

198
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,380
to respond to be tested you can very

199
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,090
easily shred people by being a total bad

200
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,430
rump and walking all over them

201
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,650
and not giving them the chance to detect

202
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,090
I hired seven people in my MSSP I made

203
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,310
that mistake I want to be a Good

204
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,510
Shepherd and I want you to make sure

205
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,030
that you guys know that if you're going

206
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,530
to do this and you're going to train

207
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,620
your internal staff you really want to

208
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,540
make sure you're going to build them up

209
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,950
then they were going to be the next

210
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,750
fleet of peppers and don't make the same

211
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,030
mistake I did I actually have chapters

212
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,559
and materials and then the next book

213
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,640
that really talked about some of these

214
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
key points here so you know think about

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,460
morale and the other thing I'll tell you

216
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,940
is that a lot of adversary simulation

217
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,440
particularly the commercial products

218
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,770
assume compromise and I actually sat

219
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,410
down with a guy who wanted to use our

220
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,410
range for an exercise and and he used

221
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,240
the term we always have a close-in

222
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,940
attack posture and I said what's up

223
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,430
close and attack boxer oh well we've

224
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,690
already compromised the network I said

225
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,170
oh wait a minute how do you know I mean

226
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,970
I've been doing cyber defense and

227
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,680
Incident Response for a lot of years and

228
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,020
it is not necessarily trivial to attack

229
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,580
a network so I don't think it's a fair

230
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,680
assumption that you should assume

231
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,980
compromise there should be an avenue in

232
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,530
because when you actually find the

233
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,320
badness on the network to have a really

234
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,990
good outcome trace it all the way back

235
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,020
to figure out how they got in don't just

236
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,870
look at cleaning up the environment it's

237
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,570
really important to know how the actual

238
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,390
compromise occurred in whatever scenario

239
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,840
that you devised there are even more

240
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,430
questions that you want to answer and

241
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,320
you see some highlighted text and I'm

242
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,390
going to ask you what is that phrase

243
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,740
business that's a command and response

244
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,090
business okay and that you're supporting

245
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,860
the value okay how many of you wave your

246
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,830
hand violently understand what the MBA

247
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,960
term value chain is show of hands one

248
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,280
person two people if you really want to

249
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,380
be business relevant understand what it

250
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,780
is your corporation or your organization

251
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,560
or your university depends on and figure

252
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,830
out how that component can successfully

253
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,620
be attacked or how that component can be

254
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,800
adversely affected and trained to defend

255
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,680
that component

256
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,450
anybody want to guess why I'm telling

257
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,410
you this is so important yes sir

258
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,319
because without the context of business

259
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,449
impact you cannot prioritize or

260
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,189
understand it's an excellent answer and

261
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,019
I'll tell you there the 50% of that

262
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,079
answer is if you are business relevant

263
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,769
you get funding time on the books

264
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:09,579
management cares and why is that because

265
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,709
you are protecting what your

266
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:14,649
organization depends on in order to

267
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,220
conduct business doing an ad syn project

268
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,839
in a corporate space just for the sake

269
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,759
of doing it making people sharper is

270
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,989
cool doing an ad sim that you train

271
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,389
twelve people for in your sock so the

272
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,879
next time really badness happens on that

273
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,529
that's a technical firm badness happens

274
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,999
on the network your sock and immediately

275
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,790
go and say we checked all of the order

276
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,319
entry and the shipping systems and

277
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,689
there's no adverse effect what can your

278
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:44,139
sock report to management sir critical

279
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,249
business systems are up and

280
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:46,929
uncompromised by this attack that must

281
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:50,439
be something else that is a win there is

282
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,199
nothing worse because I have been there

283
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:56,919
I have been I may use you I have been in

284
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,209
this position what though four-letter

285
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,509
words come out very flowery and they're

286
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,610
discussing their intensity about the

287
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,439
fact that their shipping system is down

288
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:10,779
because that affects their what begins

289
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,559
with B and ends with Onis so being

290
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,899
business relevant and understanding your

291
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,989
value chain is really important because

292
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,779
you're in fact defending your company so

293
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,489
anything that you do there is going to

294
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,799
really help sharpen your stuff and what

295
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,069
you're working on you have to have a

296
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:33,579
plan you want to be training and testing

297
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,610
for KSA's ASA's are knowledge skills and

298
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,589
abilities this is actually how the FBI

299
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:41,350
interviews they interview based on

300
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,939
knowledge skills and abilities all three

301
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,009
dimensions at least when I applied there

302
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,779
in order to figure out if you're a good

303
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,279
candidate for being a special agent or

304
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,529
an agent it's a great way of looking at

305
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,809
it because it allows you to focus on

306
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,209
what you're going to train on do that

307
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,059
people have the knowledge that they need

308
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,639
in order to successfully attack X do

309
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,199
that people have the knowledge they need

310
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:02,860
in order

311
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,850
detect trace evidence of an attack

312
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,860
knowledge is one thing taking knowledge

313
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,440
and exercising knowledge makes it into

314
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,200
an a skill I have a good friend of mine

315
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,650
my brother-in-law he's a diver and he

316
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,220
said to me Don he said to me Don you

317
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,330
can't buy skill and we're looking at all

318
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,890
the stuff in the scuba store and I'm

319
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,390
thinking man if I got that buoyancy

320
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,980
compensator would really help me out you

321
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,610
guys gone you can't buy skill I'm gonna

322
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,640
tell you the same thing you can learn

323
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,460
knowledge you can come here you can go

324
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,860
take the guys who did the workshop at 10

325
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,800
o'clock that under the wire guys they've

326
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
got a really cool online lab you can get

327
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000
all kinds of knowledge there but until

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,410
you take that knowledge and apply that a

329
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,230
skill you know you're not gonna be able

330
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,360
to really progress because knowledge is

331
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,490
great skill is what's gonna hold you

332
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,900
through to the long run your roots what

333
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,460
you really really want you also need to

334
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,010
understand when you develop a training

335
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,770
program what it actually takes I've done

336
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,740
a lot of this this is not easy when you

337
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,810
come and you develop a full scope

338
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,090
exercise so if there's an organization

339
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,650
out there they're the ATV Association

340
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,210
for talent and development they will

341
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,000
tell you and I look this up recently

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,050
just to make sure I had the numbers

343
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,840
right based on their thousands of

344
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,750
members depending on what you're

345
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,730
actually doing it takes between 23 and

346
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,670
143 hours of your labor to develop one

347
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,360
hour of premium content professional

348
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,690
delivery and that's they a nationally

349
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,970
established metric so it's it's not as

350
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,130
simple as hey let's go get a County box

351
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,600
and see if we can attack the web server

352
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,920
it takes time to put these things

353
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,650
together it takes time in order to have

354
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,110
a really functioning range whatever you

355
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,240
actually choose to have a range you have

356
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,460
to have a platform virtualization is

357
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,550
wonderful I love it you have to have

358
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,050
scenarios you've got AWS with VP sees

359
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,120
and protected is a really good idea on

360
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,450
variety of things

361
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,480
you have to have modeled networks you

362
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,950
have to think about the networks that

363
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,440
you own and again being back to being

364
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
business relevant if you understand how

365
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,260
porous your dmz is you know anybody does

366
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,380
the idea dmz porosity makes sense to the

367
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,920
group if you can actually stand up a

368
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,410
training environment that is as porous

369
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,230
as your production firewall assuming you

370
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,930
can actually get the configuration they

371
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,040
may not want to give it to you in that

372
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,460
case you have to aid and assist them

373
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,690
that's the kind of environment you want

374
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,730
to have if you have a rock-solid

375
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,820
non porous firewall you know it makes it

376
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,710
much more difficult for an adversary to

377
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,330
get in if you have an extremely porous

378
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,580
firewall I really did some consulting

379
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,050
for a Corgan ization that had three

380
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,430
thousand and eight rules in their

381
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,890
firewall only forty-one percent of them

382
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,890
had fired in the last year very

383
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,060
difficult to figure that out

384
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,730
after action analysis is probably going

385
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,590
to be your primary reporting measurement

386
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,520
and metric your simulation your scenario

387
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,970
has an information flow it does it

388
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,480
follows rules you have to set up your

389
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,410
initial session in some are usable Manor

390
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,520
script it out I'll show you some cool

391
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,080
stools to make that are cool tools to

392
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,060
make this stuff script you have to

393
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,490
figure out how you're going to observe

394
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,390
people be aware and don't be blind to

395
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,330
the fact that when you do anything and

396
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,260
you observe people's performance it will

397
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,430
have a material effect on how you how

398
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,460
they perform people who know that they

399
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,810
are being observed will behave better

400
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,760
generally and more conscientiously and

401
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,380
would be paying more attention it is a

402
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,930
well-known fact and he pick up any book

403
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,449
on Six Sigma and you will find the

404
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,310
studies and the references for that so

405
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,240
as someone building up adversary

406
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,040
simulation and trying to use these tools

407
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,490
in an educational learning environment

408
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,630
you really want to be aware that people

409
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,890
are going to be on their best behavior

410
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,530
or best hose are trying really hard that

411
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,209
may not be exactly what you get from a

412
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,650
job performance perspective it's just

413
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,420
something to be aware

414
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,830
they have to have record-keeping that

415
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,950
you meet your objectives what exactly

416
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,140
are we testing for did could you

417
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,120
actually detect these things could you

418
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,400
find XYZ and how are you actually going

419
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,940
to measure that C T FD phenomenal tool

420
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,550
doesn't take long I had an intern with

421
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,940
hardly any idea experience I I pointed

422
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,770
her in the right direction four hours

423
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,750
later of actual sweat equity in her time

424
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,330
I have a CTF captured with twenty

425
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,750
questions and hints great tool event

426
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,450
monolithic but a great tool confirm that

427
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,720
your trainee solves the case you as the

428
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,630
senior person need to understand for

429
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,120
this particular scenario set what

430
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,070
actually is the solution is that

431
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,140
identifying a root cause is it

432
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,970
identifying the artifacts and the run

433
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,640
key is it restoring a machine to service

434
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,770
once a particular decision-making

435
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,420
threshold has been reached

436
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,580
what is your going to be your success

437
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,309
criteria if you can't identify your

438
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,160
success criteria you don't know how you

439
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,900
get supporting objectives in order to

440
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,130
get to the people to the success

441
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,870
criteria and you also don't know one

442
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,480
other thing you don't really know how to

443
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,480
guide junior people to help them get

444
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,860
there because remember the point I made

445
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,710
earlier aren't my goal and the goal that

446
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,570
I want you guys to take away from me as

447
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,570
being shepherds is to help people grow

448
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,390
and become better because we need to be

449
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,250
better because they're kicking rum I

450
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,280
mean they are think about root cause

451
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,700
analysis how many of you have junior

452
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,910
people on your team and if you ask them

453
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,800
to do a root cause analysis of why a

454
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,710
local file inclusion or web

455
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,480
vulnerability was permitted they could

456
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,880
figure that out and how many of you know

457
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,370
what local lfi is probably half of your

458
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,500
at least I would expect but how many of

459
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
them could go and figure that out from a

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,610
root costs perspective this is IT in the

461
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,980
game job skills so when you're thinking

462
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,570
about building these things think about

463
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,770
how you're gonna get them to the cross

464
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,550
the finish line our network works like

465
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,179
this we have 49 50 operating systems I

466
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,010
can do all kinds of stuff and I have

467
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,350
I've got tons of scenarios we have all

468
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,080
kinds of things modeled in here and when

469
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,250
you think about building your own

470
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,440
adversary simulation network think about

471
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,900
what you actually need I tell you

472
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,870
email delivery really helps and it is

473
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,190
not the easiest thing to set up gotta

474
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,320
have some kind of email delivery got to

475
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,720
have workstation networks should have

476
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,100
physical network we have industrial

477
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,590
control multiple firewalls simulated

478
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,780
internet think about all the stuff that

479
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,280
actually takes to make the internet work

480
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,650
if you want to simulate the internet and

481
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,270
your environment you need root

482
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,020
nameservers

483
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,330
you need static routing you need

484
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,520
forwarding name servers you need all

485
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,770
that stuff you need some kind of email

486
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,780
delivery you need if you want to do

487
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,309
email directory and you want to simulate

488
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,669
the network you need MX records email

489
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:24,840
gateways there's a serv resource record

490
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,020
type for addy Kim option that maybe the

491
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,520
mail server that you're gonna use isn't

492
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,900
even going to work if you haven't even

493
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,400
set up all that stuff so you could have

494
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,730
a lot of setup to do to make email work

495
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,080
AWS is the answer it's just the thought

496
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,809
I could be wrong

497
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:44,429
artificial domain build tools there are

498
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:48,809
many of them I actually am rather fond

499
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:50,820
of one of them I wonder if you can tell

500
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,890
which one it is

501
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,890
at Auto lab automated lab Boxter

502
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,650
detection lab and if you really want to

503
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,510
kick it up a notch and duel and win

504
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,919
stuff there's a couple of really nice

505
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,980
ones out there gns3 has over a million

506
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,290
or some huge number of millions of users

507
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,919
and there's the cisco v IRL detection

508
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,679
lab is the one that i use chris long

509
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,290
created this I've actually gone back and

510
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,580
forth with him over the last three

511
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,169
months making little refinements and

512
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:20,520
testing and working with this tool it's

513
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,309
pretty darn cool detection lab is a

514
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,169
completely scripted builded build

515
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,980
process uses packer and vagrant stands

516
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,950
up for you a domain controller with a

517
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,980
reasonably hardened auditing rule set a

518
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,870
windows event forwarding server with

519
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,970
actual multiple levels of subscriptions

520
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,460
a Windows 10 machine that is highly

521
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,740
instrumented with sis Mon and Windows

522
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,330
Event collection and Windows image

523
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,750
forwarding in detail tracking and get

524
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,539
this

525
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:52,029
a Linux box with Splunk so that you can

526
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:53,859
actually collect all this data and if

527
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:56,139
that isn't enough you get OS query and

528
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,159
miters caldera

529
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,440
and all it takes six and a half hours of

530
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
watching the system run it is also fully

531
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,509
extendable I've taken Chris's

532
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:06,549
configuration I've added a third server

533
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:08,739
and I've added eight more workstations

534
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,729
so for me I can take this tool extend it

535
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,519
add more operating systems to it I push

536
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,830
a button Saturday morning Saturday

537
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,229
afternoon I have a completely fresh

538
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:23,049
environment well instrumented for the

539
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,119
kinds of things that we would want it is

540
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,279
really a great tool to look into for

541
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,499
building an automated Windows domain and

542
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:31,899
you can actually stick your own license

543
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:34,629
keys in the environment if you want to

544
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,269
if you have the volume license keys and

545
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,799
you want to make this permanent you can

546
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,419
either license it after the fact or you

547
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,489
can build it in it uses all native

548
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,019
Microsoft techniques you know where you

549
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,759
can actually do the boot floppy business

550
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,830
and it does the unattended setup it's

551
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,499
pretty good stuff so when you think

552
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:51,999
about this how do you actually select

553
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:55,289
tools and we have Gibbs rule number nine

554
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,549
always take a knife with you and what

555
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,859
that really means is make sure that you

556
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,809
have the right kind of tools tools make

557
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,549
a lot of difference there are at least

558
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:08,739
there are probably more but these are

559
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:09,759
the ones that I've actually read about

560
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,519
talk to tinkered with actually

561
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,039
experimented with in my own life a PC

562
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,720
simulator is a batch tool you've got the

563
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,359
atomic Red Team tool which is really

564
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,429
scriptable really nice very well built

565
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:26,710
maps to the mitre framework i've got

566
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,289
some slides for bp3 there's a ton of

567
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:31,059
blue team tools and i want to make a

568
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,039
point to you i've put one up in here

569
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,739
this one on the whitelist noise

570
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:38,859
generator one of the things you really

571
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,389
want to be careful about if you're

572
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,249
building up an adversary simulation

573
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:46,119
environment is having other traffic if

574
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,639
the only traffic that your security

575
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,470
onion box has is your malicious traffic

576
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,349
and baseline window stuff it really

577
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,239
helps out the blue team defender because

578
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,190
he's got or she's got very little stuff

579
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,769
to look at so it's really important for

580
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:01,299
you to figure out how you can actually

581
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,990
go get other stuff

582
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,750
to make your range look better it's

583
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,960
important log n D is available I'm

584
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,490
really a fan of this I've actually used

585
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,559
long gut log MD on a number of

586
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,600
consulting engagements it is a well

587
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,730
worth the price tag of free and if you

588
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,710
want to go for the the kitten caboodle

589
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,040
you spend 300 bucks

590
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,760
there's also a great site and I cannot

591
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,230
pronounce the guy's last name but his

592
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,330
first name is Chris I had lunch with him

593
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,150
at the San Ximena recently and he's put

594
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,770
together a whole package of tools called

595
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,130
open sock at open socket IO and he's got

596
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,350
all the various components listed out

597
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,420
that you know he puts together and as a

598
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,540
fly away lab environment so in thinking

599
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,160
about what kind of tools you can use

600
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,770
from an open source perspective just

601
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,809
checking out the open sock IO website

602
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:52,610
can give you a pretty rich set of tools

603
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,230
to help you along the leg of what you

604
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,679
would need the pen test IT folks have

605
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,330
actually kept they keep a running list

606
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,750
and a comparison of some of these tools

607
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,580
what I really want you to take away from

608
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,710
this list is not who's read not who's

609
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,140
green but look at the criteria on the

610
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,350
left hand side the criteria on the left

611
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,809
hand side are saying these are the

612
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,429
various mitre attack framework

613
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:19,190
techniques that these tools support that

614
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,860
actually guides you in thinking about

615
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,900
what does our team really need to

616
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,480
understand what how well are we

617
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,490
instrumented do we in fact have an

618
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,730
ability to detect lateral movement dudes

619
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,590
our team even understand what lateral

620
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,130
movement is does our team understand

621
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,460
what defense evasion is do we think are

622
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,040
we can we afford carbon black retain ium

623
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,080
do we have one of those premium edr

624
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,990
tools if you are a small shop some of

625
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,910
these things you can't afford if you're

626
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,250
a fortune 500 company then you've got

627
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,900
lethargy to work through to know what

628
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,790
tool you have and to get access to it

629
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,590
but you still there's all kinds of tools

630
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,400
you can be available exfiltration how

631
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,220
would you actually detect worm bots

632
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,050
that's a term I just made up for you

633
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,670
guys warm bots that work for the group

634
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,950
how can you detect if a worm bot is

635
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,450
actually using Gmail with file

636
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,610
attachments to send your private data

637
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,040
out the door there's actually malicious

638
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,429
code

639
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:20,570
does that apt simulator this is a pretty

640
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,960
darn cool tool I would start here it's

641
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,649
dirt cheap

642
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,480
it's batch it's designed to have you

643
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,340
take pieces of part of it you can pull

644
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,840
one piece out test and train on one

645
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,389
piece rinse wash repeat your virtual

646
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:35,659
machine snapshot it use a component put

647
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:37,610
it back together use the whole thing

648
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,529
this guy will actually do local file

649
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,629
collection see two connections see two

650
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:44,659
connections via WMI I will do malware

651
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:46,399
rat it'll actually download me me cats

652
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:48,710
although in deference to Eric on reddit

653
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,999
will not download me me dogs that's I'm

654
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,159
a dad I have a dad joke I had a teenager

655
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,559
me my god have a dad joke I'm persistent

656
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,970
there's three or four different ways

657
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,129
that it can establish persistence for

658
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:03,919
you for the low low cost of free really

659
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,899
neat little tool we actually start in

660
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:07,460
our program with this and I gave you the

661
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,700
web link for et3 in crypto IO and I I

662
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,019
cannot pronounce the gentleman's name I

663
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:17,450
wish I could he's got a bunch of a bunch

664
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,399
of YouTube videos to tell you how it

665
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,259
work you need Kali

666
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:25,279
it runs on Kali so you can drop your

667
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,440
your your tax ID system and your and

668
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,119
your victim side system out on your

669
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,080
network as an as an ISO for free he

670
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,909
gives you a number of sample traces a

671
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,110
couple you know four or five different

672
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,259
c2 mechanisms a few different hash

673
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,299
collision mechanisms that look like real

674
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,460
malicious software and a number of peak

675
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,610
app based executions and his price tag

676
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,679
to add more components to the mix is

677
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:51,409
like three to five dollars us it's

678
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,240
really inexpensive what he's built and

679
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,820
the guys go in for volume I swear it

680
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,049
downloads agents you get the code you

681
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,659
are under control you get a piece of

682
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:04,460
Python code where's mark bag and I know

683
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,769
he'll be happy it's Python code here

684
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,869
these are the ones that are run for free

685
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:11,419
out of the box by the way it took me

686
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,039
four hours soup-to-nuts beginning to end

687
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,659
to read the 40d page manual fire up the

688
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,340
BMS did everything running and actually

689
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,809
create these slides four hours is all I

690
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,299
took to do this and then I had to go eat

691
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,639
lunch or have a snack or something all I

692
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,220
did it generate the client give it the

693
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,679
profile stand it up and running run it

694
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,040
you're now listening on your

695
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,020
River this is designed to look a bit

696
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,690
Metasploit like so it's a metaphor we're

697
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,450
familiar with on the client-side all you

698
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,820
need is the code so that's a Python

699
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,870
executable think about what you could do

700
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,060
from a training perspective on a Linux

701
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,360
box if all you have to do is run some

702
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,560
code so let's think about this cron job

703
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,790
shout it out

704
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,360
cron job modify a file in an it dot b

705
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,090
add something to a user's dot bash RC

706
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,510
file add something to an hourly cron job

707
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,490
what else can you do on a UNIX box if

708
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,680
you've got the code

709
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,350
audience-participation ssh root key add

710
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,230
it to a system utility make your own LS

711
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,140
command to run this in the background I

712
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,880
mean you know since you've got the code

713
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,240
it's pretty pretty open not only that

714
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,250
the code actually generates the

715
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,250
signature on the wire so your security

716
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,000
onion box

717
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,070
I mentioned security onion earlier this

718
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,110
is a default rule it's picked up right

719
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,700
out of the box by default it's available

720
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,520
always works you can pick it up and then

721
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,020
you what you wanted you from there is

722
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,670
trained people to click the button and

723
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,370
go right into cabana at least in the

724
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,490
onion platform and go look and see so

725
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,100
what I just showed you is I know

726
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,560
afternoons worth of work a couple of

727
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,180
virtual machines on your network that

728
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,350
you can deploy some execution code under

729
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,300
your control your intrusion detection

730
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,210
system can pick it up your analysis

731
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,160
system I mean anybody in the room is

732
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,900
there anybody here who has not

733
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,050
downloaded installed security onion

734
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,270
anybody good so you guys have all used

735
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,310
this right-click integration and I can

736
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,630
actually see what's going on

737
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,180
this becomes an analysis opportunity for

738
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,060
your junior staff poof what does it look

739
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,010
like if you let this guy run overnight I

740
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,630
wouldn't want to know who did that some

741
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,490
guy might have done one don't want to

742
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,260
say anything but this could be a great

743
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,450
activity you've dropped this off on a

744
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,070
cally box somewhere on an end user

745
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,240
segment on a switch or a Raspberry Pi

746
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,180
you go ahead and run this activity let

747
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,610
it run on an IP address on the network

748
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,380
you now

749
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,770
they need to investigate DHCP

750
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,390
investigate the switch get the MAC

751
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,850
address investigate the CaMKII table on

752
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,320
the switch assuming you're using Crisco

753
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,870
products go find the Machine go find the

754
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,060
jack you can actually make this a go

755
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,240
hunt down the box exercise for hours and

756
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,520
a Raspberry Pi what does it cost

757
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,640
nowadays forty bucks and my right it's

758
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,350
40 bucks for raspberry oh you got to buy

759
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,600
the little power thingy 48 atonic red

760
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,370
team i fat down on the phone with these

761
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,490
guys love tool this tool is specifically

762
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,320
designed to map up to the miter attack

763
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,130
framework

764
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,560
it has codes specifically the numbers

765
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,500
against the miter attack techniques to

766
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,570
get the attack framework to get eight to

767
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,370
get art I asked them can I call it art

768
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,020
and they're like you can call it art to

769
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,390
get art to run you just invoke the

770
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,610
command up there assign it to a variable

771
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,650
they suggest that you use the attack

772
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,000
technique so it makes your code flow

773
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,310
really nicely and run it all of the

774
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,990
things of how this tool works are all

775
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,600
defined in this really really nice yeah

776
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,580
Mel file so it's fairly well documented

777
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,250
down here including the command if I

778
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,640
have access to the command and I'm doing

779
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,900
this what can I do

780
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:02,180
it's an extensible go ahead what kind of

781
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,760
you if I have that easy path of

782
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,500
execution right there and the blue stuff

783
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,180
on the up the blue stuff in the upper

784
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,160
right hand corner and this is actually

785
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,200
what it's running down here I got to use

786
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,630
the cool thing II right if that's what

787
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,850
it takes what can I do I give you I can

788
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,250
do anything I want right how about how

789
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,780
about for the really sophisticated room

790
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,220
go figure how to do some process

791
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,780
hollowing that's a challenge I'll see

792
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,600
you next year

793
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,620
commercial product there's a boatload of

794
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,500
commercial products in on the space lots

795
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,670
of things are available in the

796
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,890
commercial space you can spend tons of

797
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,930
money on this stuff attack IQ safe reach

798
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,110
image in this list of stuff there's even

799
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,480
some stuff for office 365 they actually

800
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,300
have an attack simulator there are also

801
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,020
things that you can use that are not

802
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,000
necessarily designed to be adversary

803
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,630
simulation but they can vary

804
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,340
easily be adapted for adversary

805
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,380
simulation a cobalt strike

806
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,810
I talked with Raphael Mudge on the phone

807
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,270
he actually called me and he gave me a

808
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,040
number of ideas he actually has four or

809
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,230
five recipes over the last couple of

810
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,210
years posted on the site you can go use

811
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,890
cobalt strike cobalt strike has like a

812
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,040
15 or 20 day trial you can use the sky

813
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,860
folks kite this by a grim they're one of

814
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,750
our sponsors here you can come to a

815
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,120
region cypher range you can also get the

816
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,790
breaking point by Ixia which has

817
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,610
hundreds and hundreds of malicious

818
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,400
software protocols and I think it's well

819
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,080
over 2300 I can't remember the exact

820
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,450
number of application protocols there's

821
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,980
a number of things that can be used in

822
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,480
this space if you're going to invest in

823
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,760
a breach and attack simulation tool

824
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,740
think about what you actually want to

825
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,530
get out of it how you want to be able to

826
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,030
measure because they're designed to

827
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,450
measure how well your tools work what

828
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,650
are you actually going to test do you

829
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,970
what do you need to test your email

830
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,220
capability some of the systems are very

831
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,640
very sophisticated in what they will do

832
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,150
Saima late actually has hundreds of

833
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,159
attack oriented payload attachments that

834
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,649
they put their model is to send it in to

835
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,429
an email address on your domain to one

836
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,899
email address that flows through all of

837
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,210
your protection mechanisms and they have

838
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,649
an opener and if the opener actually

839
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:21,418
sends an email back with the right

840
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,879
identifier they know which particular

841
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,409
attack pattern got through and they can

842
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,679
report on that it's pretty cool stuff

843
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,219
how well do you instrument your tools I

844
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,350
worked in an environment where that nice

845
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,270
feature in Windows where it prompts up

846
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,739
and says do you actually want to run

847
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,449
this administrative capacity that's not

848
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,370
a good idea but that's the kind of thing

849
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,440
you could test so again I asked you

850
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
earlier about your security posture

851
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,800
these tools are really designed to help

852
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,510
you assess your security posture and how

853
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,610
coarse is your perimeter they take

854
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,679
specific approaches most of the

855
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,090
commercial tools you know operate in

856
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,070
isolation you take a similar environment

857
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,140
standing up on your own segment you

858
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,760
isolate it you test it you're using your

859
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,070
golden image they deploy artificial

860
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,240
agents

861
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,618
you can also generate

862
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,690
traffic on a virtual machine under your

863
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,070
control that you dropped off the network

864
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,470
so in case something does happen it's a

865
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,660
pause button in the VMware interface you

866
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,880
can shut that off immediately you can

867
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,010
also use what's called black box multi

868
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,530
vendor or multi vector where they deploy

869
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,330
a very very thin agent and it really

870
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,330
functions just like a bot where you're

871
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,530
actually sending command and control

872
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,990
from the SAS service also the vast

873
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,880
majority of these things are SAS based

874
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,920
so in order to use them most of the

875
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,040
contemporary bas tools breach and attack

876
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,720
simulation tools you have to be

877
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,080
connected to the Internet in some way

878
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,910
1500 distinct attacks has a huge active

879
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,040
community for support they do not have

880
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,500
any c2 capability for these attack IQ

881
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,700
folks however they have stellar

882
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,320
remediation guidance so if their system

883
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,600
actually detects and finds out that we

884
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,640
were capable of executing persistence on

885
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,430
a Windows machine here are some things

886
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,310
that you could do to protect from that

887
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,070
the cyma lead dies these are from there

888
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,270
from a foreign country I think they're

889
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,880
Israeli or something like that

890
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,920
Israeli so they have a number of

891
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,270
features I thought it would be kind of

892
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,560
cool to give you an idea of what this

893
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,090
looks like you pick the tool the

894
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,110
technique

895
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,990
push the button send it through you as

896
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,940
the operator are in control

897
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,220
whenever the tool or technique works it

898
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,080
sends a positive act back to the cyma

899
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,060
late site so you get a way of actually

900
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,410
scoring it and getting a reporting

901
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,310
mechanism my fav is site by the Grimm

902
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,540
guys complex adversary simulation tool

903
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,620
scythe actually not safe

904
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,660
grim scythe whoever they created this

905
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,760
tool to aid and assist in their

906
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,620
penetration testing practices because

907
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,390
that is a very well understood technique

908
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,770
for them roundest right and they created

909
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,900
this really neat tool so they can

910
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,630
actually take this tool and do all kinds

911
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,910
of different things with it from a Red

912
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,380
Team perspective and they use it in

913
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,030
engagements and they said aha we can

914
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,530
actually use this for more learning

915
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,900
environments it supports the attack

916
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,690
framework has mobile has guides it has a

917
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,940
whole bunch of communication modules now

918
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,010
I didn't screenshot the entire screen

919
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,390
because when I get that it gets really

920
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,890
small and you can't read it I just

921
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,860
grabbed part of it so there's a lot more

922
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,900
capability modules than the ten that I

923
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,120
have here

924
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,220
but the real neat thing about this

925
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,620
particular platform is on the next slide

926
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,940
where you get to put this stuff together

927
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,180
in a sequence in a set of orders and you

928
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,550
can save that configuration out and you

929
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,830
can rerun it so if you're going to build

930
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,900
a tool and you want to roam different

931
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,370
people on your team through different

932
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,310
levels you make the investment one time

933
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,190
with how to build your scenario and then

934
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,900
you can actually rerun that scenario

935
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,780
later on you as the operator because

936
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,310
this tool isn't designed to be like an

937
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,930
education training tool it's designed to

938
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,670
be an automation and improvement tool

939
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,740
you as the operator will have to keep

940
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,810
track we ran that's right

941
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,880
we ran salic through the exercise Sally

942
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,470
got a B and C right

943
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,690
he works for cyborg Ren neat stuff you

944
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,140
do need to be aware of range isms as a

945
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,480
technical term

946
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,770
remember that agents don't behave like

947
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,260
people if you've been up against a real

948
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,770
adversary an agent will not sleep an

949
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,200
agent does not take time off and like

950
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,390
and when World of Warcraft gets released

951
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,700
in China they don't do that agents just

952
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,530
run they generate traffic based on

953
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,960
whatever schedule you said agents don't

954
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,780
pivot necessarily agents do this one

955
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,450
thing they don't figure out and explore

956
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,640
and say that looks juicy and that looks

957
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,560
juicy and I had this list and I know

958
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,390
that's the phone server and if I go to

959
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,190
the fight they don't they don't and they

960
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,890
will function like a person they're

961
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,830
automated which is good but realize that

962
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,780
you have just small limitation in using

963
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,030
agents they also don't read your email

964
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,040
there's a great story of a number of

965
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,230
major corporations don't want to say

966
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,870
anybody's name but when the attackers

967
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,180
actually get in one of the first things

968
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,700
they're doing lately is trying to get

969
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,650
ahold and find out who the security team

970
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,140
is attached to their credentials and

971
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,990
started reading their Outlook mail now

972
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,110
that's insidious and I've actually been

973
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,690
in the room personally with people that

974
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,210
that's happened to agents currently to

975
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,370
my knowledge cannot read your mail which

976
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,299
is probably a good thing right

977
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,050
the other thing about agencies you have

978
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,730
to be careful is that if you don't

979
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,240
generate activity with both network

980
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,060
activity and some kind of a non system

981
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,090
trace event you're only helping your

982
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,390
staff learn half of the story so you

983
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,240
could do things that have great is this

984
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,040
real as the attack traffic rule does

985
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,360
this really look like our traveling

986
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,280
notebook user really has dry decks on

987
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,230
the machine or e Modi or anything like

988
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,390
that is that and you can do that and

989
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,890
that's pretty good but if you can't do

990
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,100
anything on system to find it you're

991
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,110
only you're not really training like you

992
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,720
fight you're the only training so far so

993
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,010
some of these things only carry you so

994
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:18,380
far the other thing is that you do not

995
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,460
want to over instrument your training

996
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,400
environment if you don't have 46 88

997
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,950
detail tracking enabled in your global

998
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,750
active directory in your company's

999
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,090
Network you are not helping your blue

1000
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,570
team if you enable 46 88 detail tracking

1001
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,340
in your training environment because

1002
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,630
you're going to teach them to be

1003
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,760
dependent on something that they don't

1004
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,080
have in the real world

1005
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,630
okay that's also something else I've

1006
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,160
learned is you really have to be careful

1007
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,720
and we are really careful when we

1008
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,720
explain to people that the environments

1009
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,400
that we trained on in our range have

1010
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
degrees of instrumentation I think it's

1011
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
important to note so if you want to do

1012
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,800
this

1013
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
think about the capability that you need

1014
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,780
let that simmer in your mind to figure

1015
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,590
out how you're actually going to

1016
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,570
exercise it figure out what your

1017
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,490
security posture is what your value

1018
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,200
chain is what you're actually going to

1019
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,020
do to build things in right order also

1020
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,850
you really want to think about this

1021
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,650
right over here what I'm trying to get

1022
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,680
across here in this area is ensure that

1023
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,240
whatever you're doing is repeatable and

1024
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,369
and the specialized knowledge that it

1025
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:30,830
takes for that attack doohickey that's a

1026
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,690
technical term make sure that that's

1027
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,160
actually written down because if it

1028
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,700
depends on you Fred or Amy and Fred and

1029
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,470
Amy aren't here because Fred Namie went

1030
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,080
on vacation and nobody else can run the

1031
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,880
scenario for your next junior staff so

1032
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,109
make sure you do your britainís stuff

1033
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:46,400
down it's it's important so that you

1034
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,380
have a repeatable

1035
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,190
we'll program do a SWOT analysis

1036
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,210
okay then MBA term strength weakness

1037
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,119
opportunity and threat think about what

1038
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:00,759
you own think about what you don't known

1039
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:04,420
if you don't own DLP and you don't own

1040
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,599
any capability that can examine data

1041
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,549
that's leaving your network via email

1042
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:11,200
FTP or whatever

1043
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,680
how can you compensate for that do you

1044
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,839
have a flow auditing capability do you

1045
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,849
have a capability to look and see for

1046
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:22,180
your firewall logs if the packet size is

1047
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,670
actually reported if the packet size is

1048
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,440
actually recorded on the flow events in

1049
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,240
your firewall do you have a way of

1050
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,789
actually getting the list of all of the

1051
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:32,529
records that went to Gmail from a

1052
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:34,779
particular user so you can actually add

1053
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:38,200
up all of those packet sizes and make

1054
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,509
the decision and find out that user

1055
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:42,700
emailed 47 gigabytes of mail over the

1056
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,069
next two days you got to think about all

1057
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,869
these things when you think about what

1058
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:49,029
you have and what you don't have and

1059
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:50,769
what you're trying to test and you

1060
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,509
really have to get creative and think

1061
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:54,089
about the data that you have available

1062
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:56,680
you will also you're also going to be

1063
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,660
capable if you take the mitre attack

1064
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,940
framework and you're seeing what you own

1065
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,190
at given stages where you can do gap

1066
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,950
analysis if you can do gap and I'm

1067
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,809
really excited about this if you can do

1068
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:09,819
gap analysis against the mitre framework

1069
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,470
and you can clearly say to management

1070
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,930
that we cannot actually defend these

1071
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,609
business critical systems because we

1072
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:19,359
can't monitor for this kind of stuff you

1073
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,799
actually have a really good way of

1074
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,940
thinking about what you're going to

1075
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,369
budget for and what your limitations are

1076
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,930
so you can actually improve your posture

1077
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,700
and then your posture is business

1078
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,099
relevant because it reflects your value

1079
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:32,200
chain that's a win for you because

1080
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,210
you're talking in the language that your

1081
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,809
business leaders really want how do you

1082
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:43,809
measure success you have to think about

1083
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:46,539
your measurement tool you also have to

1084
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:47,980
think about your measurement tool that

1085
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,299
does not punish the people that you're

1086
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:52,119
measuring I actually have a number of

1087
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:54,430
things in my book on this topic

1088
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:57,640
Carson Zimmerman did a great talk he's

1089
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,029
the author of the mitre world class sock

1090
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:04,119
book it's around 300 pages he did a

1091
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,190
really good talk at the sock summit in

1092
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,710
New Orleans you know be on the lookout

1093
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,690
for when that drops on the sans YouTube

1094
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,059
channel cuz it's well worth your 25

1095
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:15,640
minutes he talks about toxic metrics and

1096
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,390
the talk I can't do it justice to what

1097
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,740
he talks about but it's really really

1098
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,009
worth it um I have a number of metrics

1099
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:25,630
that I've put down with definitions

1100
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,339
these are things that you want to try to

1101
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:29,619
kind of measure for right what is the

1102
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:33,009
mean time to detect and then contain if

1103
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:35,230
you want to teach someone who can find

1104
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,200
an event validate an event and then get

1105
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,180
them to at least articulate on this

1106
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,609
event we can do this action to contain

1107
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:43,809
it and we think that that's going to

1108
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:45,700
work is that thank you

1109
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,250
is that five minutes ten minutes or

1110
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,900
eighty minutes because they couldn't

1111
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,029
even figure out how to research the

1112
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:54,069
right thing and the other thing that you

1113
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,230
want to think about here is how can you

1114
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,569
have a mean time to detect and contain

1115
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:01,119
that does not adversely affect a

1116
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,980
business process so I've got a story

1117
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,630
back in my days at Old Dominion is the

1118
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,329
ISS Oh public institution I can actually

1119
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:12,880
name them we had a machine that was

1120
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,789
running some kind of ColdFusion app and

1121
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:20,980
that app got hammered and it had been

1122
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,420
online for a year and a half and why it

1123
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,829
lived for a year and a half is still

1124
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:25,869
amazing to us but one day it got

1125
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:28,119
hammered and it was hammering the rest

1126
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,740
of the network and when I say hammering

1127
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,920
I mean it was saturating a one gig link

1128
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,809
for the best of its ability so much so

1129
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:36,640
it was affecting land traffic okay

1130
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,750
that's what I was doing when I say

1131
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,599
hammering the network we shut it off

1132
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:43,960
immediately because nobody could find it

1133
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,329
nobody knew what it was and we try to

1134
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,460
talk to all business units we come to

1135
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,599
find out this machine is running a web

1136
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,130
app that was created by a consultant

1137
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,829
many moons ago and that web app is

1138
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,440
specifically for connecting interns with

1139
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,039
internships in the summer this event

1140
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,730
happened in April did I or did I not

1141
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,039
break a business process for a

1142
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:11,440
university when I shut the box off in

1143
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,400
April

1144
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,440
how many think yes how many think no for

1145
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,270
those of you listening at home we had no

1146
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,700
knows we had lots of yeses that's right

1147
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,540
the containment action in this case is

1148
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,550
to determine what is the inbound traffic

1149
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,710
pattern that that web application uses

1150
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,020
permit only that at the actual

1151
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,970
switchport level because that's the

1152
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,580
closest to the inbox and block all other

1153
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,310
outbound traffic until you can figure it

1154
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,050
out for the next 48 hours while you try

1155
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,730
to deal with the case that is a much

1156
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,980
better containment action and the kind

1157
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,660
of thinking that you want to grow is

1158
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,630
people figuring that out

1159
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,610
timeline reconstruction how do you

1160
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,650
actually measure for timeline and how do

1161
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,690
you teach timeline analysis what are the

1162
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,130
metrics that you want to be measuring

1163
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,170
for the better off you can encourage

1164
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,630
people to understand metrics and do that

1165
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,240
the better off you are

1166
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,250
waagh md is a great tool for this kind

1167
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,600
of stuff it really helps out in

1168
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,420
generating analysis sets and helping you

1169
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,710
do time line and getting information

1170
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,870
together it can also collect a lot of

1171
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,570
other data in addition to the windows

1172
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,780
login events when you run this tool not

1173
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,450
only can you run a baseline today and

1174
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,730
then compare an output set to a baseline

1175
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,660
tomorrow

1176
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,660
you can also very quickly see the

1177
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,850
reports that are zero-length produce no

1178
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,770
data so that's not an issue the reports

1179
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,420
that actually have some information has

1180
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,130
some stuff for me to investigate so

1181
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,320
using this tool as a simple automation

1182
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,780
even at the free level can make your

1183
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,120
people more effective it's well worth

1184
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,580
the download looked at if you upgrade to

1185
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:49,000
the pro version you actually get some

1186
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,740
really nice add-on capabilities where it

1187
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,210
really helps to give you an idea of

1188
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,730
what's occurring in the process tree so

1189
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,160
that's something that if you if you try

1190
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,900
to teach people how to learn this habit

1191
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,400
this tool happens to help you out and

1192
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,330
learn that after-action reports you get

1193
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,640
five people together

1194
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,170
excuse me six people I like to do team

1195
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,420
of two team of two of working they're

1196
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,520
working on a case together you compare

1197
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,960
notes how do you actually want to

1198
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,640
conduct after-action do you want to have

1199
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,010
people print stuff out I have found

1200
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,990
getting people to talk on the whiteboard

1201
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,320
works really effectively I'm a real big

1202
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,360
fan of an incident response report how

1203
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,870
many of you

1204
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,610
actually read the 30 some of my pages in

1205
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,850
my book where I talk about our reports

1206
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,790
good stuff I hope so we actually have

1207
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,700
people write I our reports and I eat my

1208
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,590
own dog food in this I use my own format

1209
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,910
I've used this format for 12 years

1210
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:43,300
professionally we actually want your

1211
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,340
executive summary to score a 95 on

1212
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:52,090
grammerly that was that pause right

1213
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,490
because you're all thinking oh my god he

1214
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,670
wants me to write good grammar yes why

1215
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,000
is that the image and the quality of

1216
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,390
writing by your team will end at the end

1217
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,860
of the executive summary okay I have

1218
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,590
done IR reports I can't even tell you

1219
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,030
how many in the professional world

1220
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,160
I've been searched warranted I've been

1221
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,310
subpoenaed all that kind of stuff at the

1222
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,500
university I was involved an employee

1223
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,360
investigation for half of my career at

1224
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,820
fortune 500 people have been hired and

1225
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,430
fired and sued based on my work and I'm

1226
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,170
not saying that to be an arrogant

1227
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,420
pompous jerk I'm telling you that I

1228
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,360
learned what to do and I learned what

1229
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,490
makes a difference what makes a

1230
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,760
difference is when any consumer of your

1231
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,580
data reads a well-written grammatically

1232
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,690
correct executive summary they trust you

1233
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,460
in the beginning of your establishing or

1234
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,170
relationship with HR and legal counsel

1235
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,750
they will actually pay attention to your

1236
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,670
incident timeline if you sit and talk

1237
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,040
with them because they want to know that

1238
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,680
you have the chops that if they take a

1239
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,070
document they do a firing action or they

1240
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,110
take that document to court that they

1241
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,570
have confidence that they are at at

1242
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,430
worst case scenario not going to be

1243
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,920
embarrassed but that they will win they

1244
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,350
want to know that we also make sure that

1245
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,700
you understand how to do root cause

1246
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,550
analysis articulate a position even if

1247
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,220
you make it up about business impact we

1248
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,540
want to know that you can understand

1249
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,150
root cause analysis and most importantly

1250
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,310
well secondly we also want to make sure

1251
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,110
that you've got the whole thing down

1252
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:35,020
there and writing a cap a cap is a

1253
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,110
corrective action program

1254
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,350
you want to be writing caps why caps a

1255
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,090
real world if you're in a publicly

1256
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,310
traded company and you find a breach and

1257
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,410
you find an issue internal audit is

1258
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,730
going to want to see a cap

1259
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:48,840
i'mjust time do we have left we've got

1260
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,190
ten minutes good I got five more minutes

1261
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,990
of material and then we're gonna do the

1262
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,670
stand-up tell me a story to get a book

1263
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,430
or a an adapter a thingamajig that's

1264
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,490
best story if I've got some time you

1265
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,080
don't need to spend a lot of money

1266
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,240
I used to demo all kinds of stuff by

1267
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,890
using some really simple techniques you

1268
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,810
can go to fire hall you can get all

1269
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,160
kinds of great lists you can go to

1270
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,290
malware domains pull down some lists

1271
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,630
just you know get this stuff test it out

1272
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,880
on your system try to run some of these

1273
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,990
things from some of the open source

1274
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,090
tools build your own scripts drop it off

1275
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,990
put it in the log on shell of a machine

1276
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,550
log Anila machine see what it does you

1277
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,590
can go a long way in understanding what

1278
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,050
you can and cannot test for what your

1279
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,290
tools do and do not detect by just using

1280
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,550
some of the really nice open-source

1281
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,050
tools I've pointed you guys to earlier

1282
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,960
also if you do that effort and you say

1283
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,580
you know we spent a couple of weeks we

1284
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,740
did some of these things we found our

1285
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,570
stuff didn't detect this and it detected

1286
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,920
that and then you want to actually go

1287
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,220
and buy a BAS tool that's automated

1288
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,650
you'll be in a much more knowledgeable

1289
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,120
position to know if that tool is

1290
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,410
actually going to help you assess your

1291
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:57,150
posture okay think about what you're

1292
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:02,160
testing this hopefully you guys can read

1293
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,410
this this is two different dating

1294
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,050
oriented websites dating is blocked at

1295
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,700
my house I hit teenage boys we would

1296
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,050
much prefer that they did it the

1297
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,970
old-fashioned way that they actually met

1298
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,240
the girl in person crazy parents what am

1299
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,800
I going to say so I tested this note I

1300
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,200
have two different behaviors for one

1301
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,230
dating site and another dating site the

1302
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,120
Palo Alto blocked the one on the lower

1303
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,460
right the lower it told me it was

1304
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,920
backwards but the Palo Alto did not

1305
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,980
block the one on the upper left you look

1306
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,780
and you see the behavior here this is

1307
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,150
all the block stuff you see what's going

1308
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,370
on different things are blocked some are

1309
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,160
detected as web browsing happens if you

1310
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,700
know this is what

1311
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,260
cool thing it looks like this is all the

1312
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,880
cool data you can get all this

1313
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,740
information for that site so Palo Alto

1314
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,010
pretty much understands it what happens

1315
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,740
if you do it by another mechanism you

1316
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,440
use W get W get does not look like a

1317
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,270
browser you can actually see that my

1318
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:08,400
OpenDNS stopped me not my PA box do not

1319
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,980
assume that your premium amazing tool is

1320
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,740
going to behave the same way in every

1321
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,960
instance because here's evidence that

1322
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,050
says they don't and I happen to be part

1323
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,300
of the cult of Palo Alto I actually own

1324
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,930
one I'm a real fan of a tool but it

1325
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,550
didn't have the same way I thought this

1326
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,440
was really relevant for you guys to say

1327
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,380
even premium tools like this do you

1328
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,510
behave differently based on how they're

1329
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:40,109
triggered many many many ideas you can

1330
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:42,030
use for focusing this stuff we're at

1331
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,930
five minutes right alright so I told you

1332
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,640
we're gonna you know get some volunteers

1333
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,990
to stand up for a good red-blue story

1334
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:56,520
volunteers first one up on your feet for

1335
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,390
a alpha if you guys don't want this I

1336
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,010
want this nobody's volunteering this is

1337
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:06,839
a cool tip alright no story stand up and

1338
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:11,450
tell us a story good pass up

1339
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:37,349
excellent discovery and you improve your

1340
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:40,170
security posture and what happened to

1341
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,559
you because you did that you became more

1342
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,609
business relevant and it related to your

1343
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:50,880
value chain I'm telling you this makes

1344
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,410
the difference who's next next volunteer

1345
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:56,309
oh the scenario but he was describing is

1346
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:58,709
they did a pen test against a publicly

1347
00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:00,630
facing website and all the users had to

1348
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,039
factor authentication but they

1349
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,319
discovered that the admin side did not

1350
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,569
have two-factor authentication and what

1351
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,640
was worse they were allowed to get him

1352
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,069
with seven character passwords so that's

1353
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:12,509
the incredibly weak two more volunteers

1354
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,059
two bar books I know the guy who wrote

1355
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:17,869
these they're pretty good

1356
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,070
great story I love it well last book

1357
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,100
volunteer on your feet you have to wave

1358
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,350
hi because you know I don't suppose it

1359
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,930
are you guys ballin tearing over there

1360
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:03,620
no trying trying who another person

1361
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,860
seriously one of the for class book

1362
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:13,480
alright doing it in general

1363
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,130
awesome

1364
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:48,649
[Applause]

1365
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,320
great so for those of you listening at

1366
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,180
home the story was that they were trying

1367
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,280
to attack a website on a firewall

1368
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,960
product and what they found is that all

1369
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,160
the normal stuff didn't work it was

1370
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,170
until they hit the spacebar so that's

1371
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,630
actually really good lateral thinking

1372
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,920
ladies and gentlemen I really want to

1373
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,390
thank you for your focus time and

1374
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,160
attention and I want to encourage you

1375
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,470
remember there are three types of people

1376
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:13,370
on the Internet sheep wolves and

1377
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:17,710
Shepherds via Shepherd
