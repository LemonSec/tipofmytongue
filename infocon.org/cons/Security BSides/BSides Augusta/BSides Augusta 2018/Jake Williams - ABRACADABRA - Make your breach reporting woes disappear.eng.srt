1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,220
okay so and I am still on you can hear

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,630
me on this side on the reporting side

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,600
awesomeness okay so for those that don't

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,700
know me I'm Jake Williams I'm the

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,200
founder and president founder and

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,599
president of rendition info I work for

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,520
sans I think some of you I've met there

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,009
a couple of you who I've met there and I

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,020
work with that with ions as well they're

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,340
the Institute for applied network

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,040
security I'm on voice security and let's

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,380
see I used to work at the NSA and and

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,140
all that stuff but look dislikes I hate

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,489
the whole idea of people calling

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,020
themselves thought leaders right if you

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,010
have to tell me you're a thought leader

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,660
you're not I think we can just go ahead

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,940
and clarify that now blockchain

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,640
blockchain is my number one like top

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,620
thing I hate at the moment it has to be

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,379
blockchain there are definite there are

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,929
def uses for blockchain but the vast

23
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,329
majority of use cases that we're seeing

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,010
today are not really use cases for

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,080
watching and so anyway or doesn't need

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,060
blockchain it's it's a it's a either a

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,010
solution without a problem or in some

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,260
cases blockchain the technology can't

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,909
overcome the policy problem that it's

30
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,010
trying to drive so anyway I'll get past

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,020
that here and and kind of chat about you

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,520
know a couple of things that we've been

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,229
dealing with and I'll mention kind of

34
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,579
the onus for this talk actually is

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,369
Atlanta right it's it's lanta and some

36
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,240
of the other stuff that we've been

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,350
dealing with but I'm looking in the

38
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,390
Atlanta ransomware event and I believe

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,369
the accounting now is up to 17 million

40
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,530
dollars for the Atlanta ransomware event

41
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,990
now I want to walk through why that's

42
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,210
garbage right I mean for lots of reasons

43
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,189
right but but I want to talk about and

44
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,600
I'm not gonna pick on the city of

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,799
Atlanta I want to be clear about this

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,479
the one and only time well probably not

47
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,189
the only time but but I don't have

48
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,170
dedicated slides to you know rip the

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,570
city government and talk bad about them

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,130
I mean we certainly could we could do a

51
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,630
whole presentation on that and how the

52
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,600
response was poor and a lot of that but

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,430
but again you know for me I want to

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,600
spend a little bit more time instead

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,310
talking about the overall problem that

56
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,020
we're seeing in the field so that it's

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,549
not just about the city of Atlanta right

58
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,509
because I don't want you to walk away

59
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,340
here thinking that well if we just fixed

60
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,660
that one dumb government in podunk

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,880
Georgia or whatever wait I would never

62
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,130
mind uh so if we just fixed that one

63
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,750
government everything's going to be okay

64
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,700
it's not we do a ton of incident

65
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,980
response at renditions and the things

66
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,330
that we're seeing the city of Atlanta

67
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,360
try to pull off with inflating their

68
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,920
costs we're seeing other people did we

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,230
see people inflate and deflate

70
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,510
so you know we talked about this problem

71
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,640
a little bit and as I was chatting with

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,590
other folks a couple of principles in

73
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,510
rendition about how do we deal with this

74
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,150
right what are we you know how would we

75
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,370
tackle this kind of problem we all had

76
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,019
horror stories or like hey remember that

77
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,970
incident we worked were they they tried

78
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,800
to claim X or Y walk through a couple of

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,880
those stories there because those are

80
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,200
pretty cool but where they tried to

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,510
claim a particular cost as part of the

82
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,700
part of the breach and and so a part of

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,080
the incident cost incident response

84
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,819
costs and so we want to kind of walk

85
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,290
through some of those and we came up

86
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,879
with the basically came down to a more

87
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,849
central point it's not just about it's

88
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,940
really not just about the the problem of

89
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,860
Incident Response cost reporting in the

90
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,870
first place it really comes down to data

91
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,150
all right and unfortunately we have a

92
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,860
couple of problems in InfoSec today all

93
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,630
right more general problems I'm going to

94
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,489
talk about those first is info CEQA

95
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,750
science or a religion yes exactly right

96
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,819
yes and I want to introduce after that

97
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:24,930
I'm going to talk about the problem a

98
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,970
little bit the problem overall the more

99
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,610
specific problem not the data problem we

100
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,750
talk about data problems we have two

101
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,430
problems not enough data and bad data

102
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,250
right or inaccurate data or not

103
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,680
normalized data etc so I want to talk

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,329
about some case studies and ridiculous

105
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,859
breach costs talk about the framework

106
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:42,600
overall kind of some of the commandments

107
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,970
of the framework if you will I'll talk

108
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,350
about using the framework to report the

109
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,730
breach cost and then I'll close with a

110
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,739
quick call to action ways that you can

111
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,690
help solve some of our data problems in

112
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,760
InfoSec in ways that you can use this

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,310
work at least for Incident Response so I

114
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,829
want to talk about the science or

115
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,000
religion question which one are we

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,540
anyway

117
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,950
right now when I talk to people

118
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,019
consistently particularly become to the

119
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,370
good old Augusta University who we

120
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,380
appreciate for the what now is this our

121
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,040
fifth six here I can't remember six six

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,930
five five for the fifth year in a row

123
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,329
Augusta University is hosted us and and

124
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,190
you know besides Augusta and I cannot

125
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,988
thank them enough for this this is a

126
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,570
phenomenal space it's it's great that

127
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,919
they're you know they're trying to be

128
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,599
part of the community here if you go to

129
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,010
them and you ask them about InfoSec

130
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,990
they'll throw a science 100% science

131
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,310
every one of the courses that they teach

132
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,740
in their cybersecurity curriculum is a

133
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,320
science course right and then I have to

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,729
step back and I have to ask where'd you

135
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,409
get your data right that you're teaching

136
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,940
these science courses because I look at

137
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,870
you know chemistry and mathematics

138
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,880
I guess math is we call math or science

139
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,950
now I'll go with that right chemistry

140
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,430
biology physics etc all that's based on

141
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,020
data all right and the InfoSec stuff

142
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,640
that we're dealing with is unfortunately

143
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,370
in many cases not based on data despite

144
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,750
what some of your professors and some of

145
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,100
your mentors right are gonna tell you

146
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,130
and so I like to first step back and ask

147
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,690
what is a religion in the first place

148
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,700
and I like some of these some of these

149
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,150
notes here you know religion it's a it's

150
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,070
a personal set or institutionalized

151
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,320
system of attitudes beliefs and

152
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,140
practices well I like this this sounds a

153
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,300
lot like InfoSec to me if I think about

154
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,940
the sands well it's not sands now it's

155
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,160
been handed over the Center for Internet

156
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,950
Security C is I think about the C is xx

157
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,470
critical security controls how many of

158
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,170
those are evidence-based the number is

159
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,970
significantly less than 20 it may not be

160
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,190
zero there are some folks that can argue

161
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,690
that the number is non zero but it is

162
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,330
not 20 and yet they are the 20 critical

163
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,130
security controls and and we kind of

164
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,840
stand by these and in our in our

165
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,370
practice at rendition we recommend

166
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,200
people use them but then I have to ask

167
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,640
is that based on data or is that based

168
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,550
on religion and I love this here right

169
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,110
the institutionalized system of beliefs

170
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,600
and practices and and I like here when

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,070
mirror and Webster asked us to go use

172
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,540
religion in a sentence and these are I

173
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,770
didn't even have to make these up I

174
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,240
didn't have to dig deep right it was

175
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,030
hockey as a religion in Canada and

176
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,370
politics are religion to to somebody or

177
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,020
any no it's again this the system of

178
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,090
beliefs that we hold to be now that we

179
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,740
hold to be true and again when we talk

180
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,200
about religion in the more generic sense

181
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,580
right where a lot of us are gonna go to

182
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,650
church tomorrow on Sunday right we talk

183
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,020
about there it's not based on fact now I

184
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,520
know lots of people say well it's a fact

185
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,620
for me but but let's be fair it's faith

186
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,060
is what we're talking about right it's

187
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,590
it's faith as a belief in something

188
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,530
without the actual scientific evidence

189
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,150
to back it all right and again I will

190
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,890
argue that InfoSec and in particular we

191
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,510
talked about Incident Response we're

192
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,280
seeing a whole lot of that now on the

193
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,930
red team's side the red team it's that

194
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,550
that's that's not that's not faith right

195
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,570
I mean they have faith they're gonna get

196
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,210
root right but but separately right they

197
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,640
they have a system of techniques that

198
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,980
they're gonna use we all know about the

199
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,720
cyber kill chain right and this

200
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,700
deterministic phases that one walks

201
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,660
through to go through

202
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,640
cyber cool but they're experts of this

203
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,020
and they know how to do that and that

204
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,910
for them is largely science right

205
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,520
there's not a you can really an in red

206
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,440
teamers I apologize man before if I

207
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,970
offend anybody in here if there are any

208
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,100
of you in here it's a flowchart job and

209
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,110
it's an easy job compared to defense and

210
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,670
that's just the reality of it all right

211
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,230
compared to defense and investigations

212
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,380
it is a it is inherently easier job and

213
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,270
so you know as I step back here I look

214
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,380
and I say we'll look a lot of the

215
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,600
defense stuff that we recommend we know

216
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,280
it works anecdotally but that doesn't

217
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,450
necessarily mean that it works

218
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,550
universally and in many cases of course

219
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,130
it doesn't and so I use this as an

220
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,720
example I like to ask people will

221
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
multi-factor authentication stop

222
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,880
breaches and is it cost-effective can I

223
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,010
go to management and cost justify the

224
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,660
deployment of multi-factor

225
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,980
authentication now before you answer

226
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,260
this question before you answer the

227
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,520
question I want you to know that my

228
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,040
company is a duo partner we believe so

229
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,210
heavily a multi-factor authentication

230
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,980
we've partnered with a company that does

231
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,230
nothing but multi-factor authentication

232
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,820
I guess duo does a couple of other

233
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,350
things but like that's their that's

234
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,030
their core business line and that's why

235
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,820
we've partnered with them and I have to

236
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,900
tell you when I start looking the

237
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,950
arguments here and I have to go to

238
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,140
management and make this justification I

239
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,730
have to tell them a lot of your peers

240
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,560
have multi-factor authentication MFA

241
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,990
your peers are using this you should be

242
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,460
too

243
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,780
it just takes an extra second or two to

244
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,950
use the MFA token there are no

245
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,570
productivity losses are there no

246
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,640
productivity losses of course there are

247
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,560
right I know I know all right but again

248
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,060
the arguments that people consistently

249
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,160
use are there are no productivity losses

250
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,440
when you use MFA and multiple vendor

251
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,150
reports and Incident Response reports

252
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,440
that we can read in the public domain

253
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,919
they cite MFA is an effective control in

254
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,530
preventing these particular breaches why

255
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,000
wouldn't you have that I mean with

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,179
evidence like this not using MFA it's

257
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,620
like driving around a car where you've

258
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,169
disabled the airbags intentionally and

259
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,640
none of us are gonna do that right I

260
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,290
mean that seems like a bad plan all

261
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,940
right well I want to come back and give

262
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,680
you an example for my five-year-old Jake

263
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,200
right when my peers were telling me the

264
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,210
Easter Bunny was real and I want to

265
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,320
throw out some of the evidence for this

266
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,610
to my friends told me the eggs would a

267
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,180
pure Easter morning and they did and

268
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,680
while there was some effort to find the

269
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,970
eggs I have to tell you the total cost

270
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,010
of ownership was very very low because

271
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,330
five-year-old me didn't make a lot of

272
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,520
money so my time wasn't

273
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,530
valuable every time I found an egg with

274
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,480
some chocolate or a quarter or if I'm

275
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,910
the golden egg and at least around our

276
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,590
family the golden egg was a dollar but

277
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,970
I've heard other people say it was like

278
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,340
twenty dollars or whatever again doesn't

279
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,780
matter what it was I was making so

280
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,670
little I'm that the my return on

281
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,410
investment was huge all right my total

282
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,940
cost of ownership for Easter Bunny

283
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,000
belief was very very low all right all I

284
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
had to do is continue pretending that I

285
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,720
believed in eggs magically appeared and

286
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,700
a hundred percent of my peer group not

287
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,190
some small percentage 100 percent of my

288
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,080
peer group all had Easter Bunny

289
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,700
experiences I grew up in backwards

290
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,200
Virginia believe me all right

291
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
nobody out there like I'm an atheist

292
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,980
we're not participating in this and we

293
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,710
reject all society as backwards Virginia

294
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,790
that got you lynched right it wasn't

295
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,680
something that that happened exactly and

296
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,480
so you know I kind of mentioned here

297
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,280
everybody had that experience a hundred

298
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,440
percent of my peers did I had better

299
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,270
evidence for the Easter Bunny than you

300
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,890
have for MFA and I was wrong all right

301
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,750
and so I just want to bring up here that

302
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,610
some of the things that we note that we

303
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,580
believe right to be to be this obvious

304
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,040
you know an obvious security solution I

305
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,600
can't tell you how often people come to

306
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,430
me and they're like well if we just did

307
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,630
this that would have prevented the

308
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,280
breach well let me stop you right there

309
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,620
because if your solution involves the

310
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,830
word just you've already oversimplified

311
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,440
it right and and I have to a slight Jack

312
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
Daniel on the panel that we were just in

313
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,370
on SB 315 and he said something that was

314
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,990
I mean I've been quoting the just thing

315
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,400
my team will tell you this a lot all

316
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
right if your answer involves just it's

317
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,600
already wrong but if a jack set a

318
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,250
phenomenal quote or made a phenomenal

319
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,340
quote in that panel over the last hour

320
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,840
and a half here or two hours whatever

321
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,600
he's if he said cybersecurity is a

322
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,190
complex problem I'm paraphrasing him

323
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,570
here because I don't have the exact

324
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,790
quote but we'll get it off the video but

325
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,230
decent cybersecurity is a complex

326
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,330
problem if you're trying to implement a

327
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,010
simple solution to it you're probably

328
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,800
doing it wrong and I love that all right

329
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
that gets to the heart of so many of our

330
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,090
solutions right that we come up with so

331
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,800
again I want to throw out here I had

332
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,060
better evidence for the Easter Bunny

333
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,590
that we have for a lot of the things we

334
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,890
prescribe as a surefire solutions that

335
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,870
everybody should be doing we like to

336
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,430
call these best practices by the way all

337
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,270
right but he can we know have a lot of

338
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,700
data to back these up all right I want

339
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,050
to note that anecdotes are not

340
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,029
studies right again we lack a lot of

341
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,950
data about mfa all right as we talk

342
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,690
about anecdotes they should never be

343
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,700
confused with a study or randomized

344
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,370
control trial if you work in medicine

345
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,390
some of you may know as a paramedic

346
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,200
before I got an InfoSec and kind of

347
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,279
interesting there right that whole

348
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,740
incident response background one type of

349
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,060
incident moved into a different kind of

350
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,339
incident right but you know as you look

351
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,079
in medicine we have randomized control

352
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,810
trials and these aren't necessarily good

353
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,579
for every type of data right we don't

354
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,500
want to intentionally for instance we

355
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,149
don't do randomized control trials with

356
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,070
real people on the roads with airbags

357
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,110
right because that's just negligent

358
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,459
right you wouldn't be like we're

359
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,019
disabled your airbag and when you get in

360
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,730
a wreck we'll do some studies on how you

361
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,620
survived right that would be horrible

362
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,870
and in cybersecurity obviously there's

363
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,300
some things we can't do our CTS with but

364
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,130
but to the extent that we should or

365
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,930
sorry the extent that we can we

366
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,540
absolutely should here's what I don't

367
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,430
have even though I'm a duo partner and

368
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,829
believe me you know I've asked right duo

369
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:18,480
doesn't have data on this what's the

370
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
study do we have studies showing the

371
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,310
cost of multi-factor authentication

372
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,290
related to productivity losses and I'm

373
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,520
not just talking about the productivity

374
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,170
losses where people arrive well it's

375
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,510
just one extra click or two extra clicks

376
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,339
or whatever right again this is a big

377
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,930
deal all right so I'm looking at the

378
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,180
what is the cost to do the enrollment

379
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,709
what's the cost when you lose your token

380
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,170
we're updating our smartphones every 18

381
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,600
months to two years right here every one

382
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,310
of those that involves you reinstalling

383
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,529
the token that probably involves

384
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,300
helpdesk support for average user I'm

385
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,190
guessing the people in the room here may

386
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,140
depending on technical controls be able

387
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,660
to do it themselves right obviously in

388
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,640
the the best highest security

389
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,870
environment you're going to helpdesk

390
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,720
access or helpdesk involvement anyway I

391
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,000
mean I don't know about comparative

392
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,770
compromised rates with them without MFA

393
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,110
we regularly destroy companies that use

394
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,089
multi-factor authentication when we do a

395
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,040
red team assessments so I know it

396
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,899
doesn't stop breaches I know it stops

397
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,640
some incidents right some specific

398
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,959
incidents but it certainly doesn't stop

399
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,510
breaches I don't have evidence that MFA

400
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,490
actually reduces any compromise any

401
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,110
compromises at all all right what's our

402
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,760
overall rate right have an attacker gets

403
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,339
topped with MFA how many of them stop

404
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,890
and don't continue targeting don't

405
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,660
continue targeting the the environment

406
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,649
right and I think that number is

407
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,529
probably

408
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,199
but I don't have that data I'm positive

409
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,060
that we can get that data by working

410
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,769
together now I know we're gonna clock

411
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,360
with instant response costing but but

412
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,009
again I want to start the bigger problem

413
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,959
of alright my Incident Response costing

414
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,819
is a very very or it's a response

415
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,999
accounting is a very specific example of

416
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,889
a problem that can be solved with data

417
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,540
and InfoSec alright and again I wanted

418
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,430
to come back to the broader problem that

419
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,620
we suck at data

420
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,149
we're religion I mean I'll tell you my

421
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,680
conclusion right after looking at a lot

422
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,870
of our problems is InfoSec is a religion

423
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,220
right now I'm not saying that that makes

424
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,170
any of what we have wrong doesn't make

425
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,509
our best practices any was best right or

426
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:09,309
doesn't mean we shouldn't use them but

427
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,480
we should be very clear when we

428
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,670
communicate with management about what

429
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,259
is it that we're actually dealing with

430
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,160
here is data or is this anecdotes and so

431
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,569
again I'll mention here you know help

432
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,459
participate or help generate data by

433
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,019
participating in studies and surveys

434
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,759
alright this can be literally as easy as

435
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,009
going on Twitter I run probably half a

436
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,559
dozen Twitter polls a week and you know

437
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,069
Sanz runs surveys the Verizon dbi are

438
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:34,649
you can partner with them to submit data

439
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,449
semi anonymously here's the big one free

440
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:38,769
we don't know when you don't have data

441
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:42,879
freaking admit it I'm is so sick I'm so

442
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,290
sick of people coming on the going like

443
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,809
well we know that do you really know it

444
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:48,910
or do you think it you have a strong

445
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,220
belief in it right because those are two

446
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,199
very different things and and look we

447
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,059
lose credibility in the field we hurt

448
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,370
the field overall the profession overall

449
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,050
and we pretend to have data that we

450
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,540
don't and : Powell said it best I mean I

451
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,129
have to steal this from Colin Powell he

452
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:05,050
said tell me what you know then tell me

453
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,819
what you don't know this is what we suck

454
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:08,589
at an InfoSec by the way he says only

455
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,629
then are you allowed to tell me what you

456
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:12,850
think imagine if we started off

457
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,589
somewhere our best practices discussions

458
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,889
this way where we said hey I don't know

459
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,959
anything we know very little all right

460
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,179
here's a couple of anecdotes but let me

461
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,470
tell you we don't know we don't have any

462
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,230
good data on control studies and any of

463
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,110
that and but we think these following

464
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,300
actions are gonna help you out now look

465
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,589
I think that puts us in a much worse

466
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,139
position to try to suggest remediation

467
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,790
steps and and all that stuff with

468
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,199
management that's why most of us don't

469
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,089
do it but but let's be very clear we are

470
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:42,490
being dishonest right the majority of as

471
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,050
we look at let's say manufacturing

472
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,970
safety for instance they have numbers

473
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,459
have data around that and so we go in

474
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,589
and we present our findings side by side

475
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,899
and say this will help right management

476
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,699
without knowing that we're lying to them

477
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,009
assumes lying being dishonest whatever

478
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,509
you want to say there without them

479
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,490
knowing that right they then assume that

480
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,769
we're using basically the same reporting

481
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,600
standards right we're actually reporting

482
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,160
data when you look at somebody who's

483
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,750
trying to implement who's safety control

484
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,399
manufacturing if they don't have data

485
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,779
behind it they tell you like we think

486
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,129
this is going to be effective here's why

487
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,779
we think it's gonna be effective they

488
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,399
don't data though they tell them we

489
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,139
don't all right and so again this kind

490
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,790
of forms one of the bigger problems that

491
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,740
we had we deal with so as you get an

492
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,759
abracadabra

493
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,470
I'm gonna talk about does this even

494
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,000
solve a problem with breach reporting

495
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,009
what is it alright well look breaches

496
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,899
are occur in a ridiculous pace I don't

497
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,250
have to tell anybody in the room that we

498
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,560
know every week my data gets compromised

499
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,699
something by somebody else I'm not

500
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:34,720
talking about every week there's a new

501
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,639
breach in the news it feels like every

502
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,990
week I'm getting another email or it's

503
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,050
like sorry we lost your data

504
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,040
organizational leadership struggles to

505
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,259
budget for incidents we work a lot of

506
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:45,550
Incident Response it's our biggest

507
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,339
service line by dollar amount biggest

508
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,899
service line a tradition in for a second

509
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,430
and so we work a lot of this and I can

510
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,559
tell you almost universally no budgeted

511
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,870
for an incident you should write it

512
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,639
shouldn't take an incident for you

513
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,410
shouldn't take an incident for you to

514
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,790
have to figure out hey how are we gonna

515
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,949
fund doing an incident response right

516
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,780
everybody in the room here I think

517
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,089
agrees that it's now no longer a matter

518
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,280
of if it's just a matter of when and how

519
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,380
bad all right just a matter of when and

520
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,150
how bad now look if you roll back five

521
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,349
or ten years there are a lot of people

522
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,030
like well we're not gonna get breached

523
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,770
and it's like timeout brother today

524
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,869
that's not at all the case all right so

525
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,669
the problem that we run into then is how

526
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,829
much do you budget few organizations

527
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,510
publicly report the true costs there are

528
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,250
incident response activities and there's

529
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,559
no standards for identifying which cost

530
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,360
should and maybe more importantly should

531
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,820
not be included in incident reporting

532
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,890
and its lack of standardized incident

533
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,659
cost reporting it hurts businesses it

534
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,610
hurts insurers and it hurts our

535
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,919
consumers our legislators we were just

536
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,530
over in the SB 315 room talking on the

537
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,210
panel there and we actually had one of

538
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,490
the Georgia state legislators that you

539
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,720
know that actually helped vote on the

540
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,100
law and she actually was very very

541
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,250
instrumental in in helping convince the

542
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,750
governor to go ahead and veto that

543
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,789
horribly written piece of legislation if

544
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:59,770
you don't know what SB 315 is take

545
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,390
that is homework please go learn about

546
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,190
it because it's a train wreck and it's

547
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,870
gonna come back alright it's like Night

548
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,460
of the Living Dead they didn't they

549
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,510
didn't get it through the first time

550
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,100
they will get something through right

551
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,200
without a standard for this though it's

552
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
very very difficult to perform any

553
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,610
apples-to-apples comparisons and our

554
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,650
goal here is to put out a framework with

555
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,900
some information that you can use to go

556
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,250
and alleviate this problem we want

557
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,930
enable organizations to make sound

558
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,880
Incident budgeting decisions this is

559
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,460
very very important for us and so we

560
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,530
talked about abracadabra I know that's a

561
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,180
long acronym there are acceptable best

562
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,070
practices for reporting accounting costs

563
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,350
accrued dispensing of the adversary in

564
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,540
breach reporting activities trains so

565
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,040
again I know that's a mouthful we're

566
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,180
just going to shorten it up to Abra

567
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,210
because yeah I when I put this together

568
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,980
I was trying to come up with you know

569
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,600
basically something that looked cool as

570
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,450
an acronym but then I had to type it a

571
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,890
couple of times and Wow

572
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,900
are there a lot of A's and B's in there

573
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,860
so yeah look in retrospect no all right

574
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,360
so we're just gonna go with Abra for

575
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,070
short and that's what we're gonna name

576
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,230
it going forward here but the original

577
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,670
name was that and that's what it stands

578
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,900
for and of course it's tongue-in-cheek

579
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,840
again our goal really is to get that get

580
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,820
that information out there or get at

581
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,030
least some level of any accounting

582
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,220
method out there that folks can use to

583
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,140
actually because today you can't go back

584
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,670
and say hey did you standard accounting

585
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,930
principles for this because there are

586
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,730
none right and that's kind of our goal

587
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,490
with putting this put this out here and

588
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,960
I've had reporters talk to me and ask me

589
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,850
hey why would an organization fudge the

590
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,140
numbers in the first place wouldn't they

591
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,460
always want them to be poor and the

592
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,740
answer is not always right because in

593
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,690
any cases people look and they say well

594
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,130
I've got five million dollars of cyber

595
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,710
insurance and they try to make a breach

596
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,020
five million dollars right they try to

597
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,790
add stuff in there like yeah that'll

598
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,920
they'll pay out on that they're not

599
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,410
going to they never pay out right I mean

600
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,240
I'm not saying cyber insurance never

601
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,120
pays out at all it's never pays out in

602
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,770
general and certainly when you're trying

603
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,710
to put stuff in that's explicitly a

604
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,420
explicitly stop by by them for instance

605
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,800
you're trying to upgrade equipment and

606
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,300
whatnot we'll talk about some of that

607
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,120
there sometimes we have folks with

608
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,500
investors and they don't want the breach

609
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,780
to look large or pom premised seok large

610
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,280
and they try to intentionally reduce the

611
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,990
numbers dramatically we see this a lot

612
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,210
with publicly traded organizations

613
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,070
or in some cases we've actually seen

614
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,080
where a publicly traded organization has

615
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,360
two separate incidents right and they

616
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,890
know that the basically the first one's

617
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,649
been discovered and it's the larger of

618
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,990
the two and they try to report it right

619
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,090
at that quarterly filing time right so

620
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,740
that hopefully that blows over and

621
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,480
nobody even notices the small one it

622
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,070
still shift costs from one to the other

623
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,940
right

624
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,190
trying to show well yeah we had a second

625
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,020
incident but this was totally minor as

626
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,210
opposed that other one that five million

627
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,380
dollar thing that you should forget

628
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,909
about in the past this one was only like

629
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,620
a hundred thousand so no big deal there

630
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,659
don't worry investors share price should

631
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:49,149
not lower and we may want to make the

632
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,799
incident appear as top cover for a new

633
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,140
platform we work with a CSO we've worked

634
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,610
with a CSO at three different

635
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,559
organizations now and he does this every

636
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,960
time this man is walking around with his

637
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,130
little portfolio you know a little

638
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,750
padfolio things that people carry around

639
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,610
and i've been in two different board

640
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,020
meetings with and when the board has

641
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,789
approved when they're like hey you know

642
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:08,169
what we need to throw some money at this

643
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:10,029
how much you think it's gonna cost he's

644
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,070
like ah you know I'd I'd really like and

645
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,330
he always shoots high cuz he's he's

646
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,740
smart about this very very business

647
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,590
savvy he says you know I'd like a half

648
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,570
million dollars and then I well I don't

649
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,620
know if we're gonna do a half million

650
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,510
dollars and he's he's already sliding

651
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,130
out like the quarter million dollar plan

652
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,260
that he's got ready to go like Inc it

653
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,909
now I'm gonna go spend the money like

654
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:29,770
he's got the plan right now and I saw

655
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,850
him he's pulling up the quarter million

656
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,620
there I know for you do a half mil

657
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,940
probably do four hundred thousand he's

658
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,500
sliding that back in he's pulling out

659
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,110
and he's got plans that like every dot

660
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,360
or bracket level with him that he's

661
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,890
walking into the boardroom with and this

662
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,409
is funny in one case but it makes her

663
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,390
horrible cost accounting and I love the

664
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,679
guy to death because he's given us a ton

665
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,240
of business and he's serious about

666
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,000
security and most of the people in this

667
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,520
room probably been impacted by in a

668
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,039
positive way by the way been impacted by

669
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,870
his security focus I won't get into

670
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,279
where this dude works but but I'll tell

671
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,460
you that he most of us have have crossed

672
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,350
paths with that without at least one of

673
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,480
the organizations in the past now he

674
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,250
likes to use incidences top cover for

675
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,990
new plans and programs and when they

676
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,450
grow with the total cost right that's

677
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,919
part of the cost that they report is

678
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:15,880
that four hundred thousand

679
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,860
half-a-million whatever that went into

680
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,779
that basically that winded that new plan

681
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,610
or program whether it was a stealth

682
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,679
watch or M FAA or whatever it is that

683
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,929
they're going to deploy sometimes people

684
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:26,970
want to increase headcount there

685
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,789
oh man we knew we were understaffed we

686
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,830
had one IT person and half a headcount

687
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,200
applied to information security so

688
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,030
obviously that wasn't appropriate as a

689
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,640
fortune 500 company so this incident

690
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
showed us the light hence we need to go

691
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,080
ahead and budget for headcount what no

692
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,159
that's that doesn't make that an

693
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,230
incident cost I have tons of real-world

694
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,760
analogies I won't get into here why

695
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,380
that's inappropriate but I always

696
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,120
certainly use those two into a2

697
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
management there sometimes I want to

698
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
replace obsolete Hardware using the

699
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,700
incident response budget this is

700
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,590
actively happening in Atlanta

701
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,440
all right that's 17 million dollar total

702
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,659
that you're hearing is them replacing a

703
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,549
lot of that and if you get down to brass

704
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,169
tacks one they're trying to max out

705
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,669
their cyber insurance policy so they're

706
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:09,720
doing two of these three of these

707
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,400
actually they're trying to max out the

708
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,990
cyber insurance payment right because

709
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,340
they've got a 20 million dollar policy

710
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,500
you've seen the numbers climb up you're

711
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,700
not gonna see a climb of about 20

712
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,860
million I'm confident if this is not

713
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,840
gonna work your insurers are not idiots

714
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,460
all right I mean let's start right there

715
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,710
your insurers can insure you for twenty

716
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,630
million dollars because they're not

717
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,460
idiots right they understand

718
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,679
underwriting all right so replacing

719
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,299
obsolete hard work right so the city of

720
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,250
Atlanta is going in and saying well we

721
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,049
wanted to ploy this EDR agent his

722
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,610
endpoint detection and response agent

723
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,770
but these machines are old and they're

724
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,090
having trouble supporting these no

725
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,620
problem I have a solution for that

726
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,450
let's buy new hardware so it can support

727
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,200
the EDR agent that we only need right

728
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,510
because of this incident and so then

729
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,919
they come back around and say okay cool

730
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,059
we're gonna replace this obsolete

731
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,159
hardware this one's my favorite this is

732
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,780
where they finally decide to hire a CSO

733
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,669
and they put that cost into the incident

734
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,760
response and I'm mind blown now from a

735
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,679
legal side your lawyers will often step

736
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:05,850
back and be like yeah that that works

737
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,010
now lawyers are very familiar with the

738
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,350
term called proximate cause not a

739
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,990
proximate proximate drop the a off the

740
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,110
front proximate cause basically means if

741
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,020
but for this event all right this thing

742
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,669
wouldn't have happened a great example

743
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,950
this is let's say that let's say I push

744
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,720
somebody out under traffic or actually

745
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,010
that's a bad example because that paint

746
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,020
that paints me is the bad guy let's say

747
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,179
that we're and let's say that we're

748
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,100
working at the office and I accidentally

749
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,850
spilled a drink

750
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,059
and unfortunately unfortunately I spill

751
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,250
it on I spilled on Bryce over there and

752
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,290
Bryce lenses

753
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,760
I got to go change my clothes cuz I'm

754
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,960
not gonna sit in wet pants all day

755
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,000
alright and Bryce walks out of the

756
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,560
parking lot gets struck by a vehicle in

757
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,930
the parking lot right now obviously

758
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,690
unless I'm like Rain Man or you know

759
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,550
some kind of other you know look in it

760
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm trying to think of like who else you

761
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,850
movie wise can do this right but but I

762
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,830
can't figure out butterfly a factor I

763
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,460
kind of thing

764
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,230
I can't spill a drink on Bryce and be

765
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,850
like I'm gonna murder Bryce by spilling

766
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,530
a drink on his pants right I can't do

767
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,330
that right but a lawyer is gonna argue

768
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,730
that the proximate cause of Bryce being

769
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,500
in the parking lot in the first place or

770
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,140
may argue right is me spilling the drink

771
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,820
on Bryce and I not been negligent right

772
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,950
had I had a spill proof lid none of this

773
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,210
would have happened embrace wouldn't

774
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,010
have been wooden bet hospitalized and

775
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,390
injured right or maybe killed or

776
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,580
whatever who knows but the seaso thing

777
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,950
your lawyers before you think man why

778
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,300
isn't somebody stopping us because your

779
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,680
lawyers are familiar with that legal

780
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,300
theory and they use it all the time in

781
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,490
civil lawsuits right in fact if you look

782
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,500
at any of your breach related but it's

783
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,780
our breach related lawsuits you almost

784
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,930
always see the words proximate cause

785
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,820
inside of basically inside of lawsuit

786
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,070
there you don't have to say this is the

787
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,870
this is the hundred percent the reason

788
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,490
this happened all you're saying that

789
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,350
it's a much lower burden to say but for

790
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,390
this thing happening right we wouldn't

791
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,460
have had this outcome and so this whole

792
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,770
hiring a CSO thing this works really

793
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,540
really well along this proximate cause

794
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,000
angle right because we say but for this

795
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,410
breach occurring we didn't have a CE so

796
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,420
before now we had an incident we

797
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,880
realized we needed to see so because of

798
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,770
the incident so we hired one so it makes

799
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,090
sense to make a part of the incident

800
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,950
response reporting cost and and I think

801
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,450
we can most of us can agree no it

802
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,880
doesn't but but legally maybe that's

803
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,860
that sounds like it makes sense right so

804
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,690
I want to pull the audience on a couple

805
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,950
of these here right and I'll ask for

806
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,080
show of hands and just commit one way or

807
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,440
the other right I'm gonna mention here

808
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,750
notification and credit monitoring costs

809
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,430
right so an organization the processes

810
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,250
PII data and some credit cards they're

811
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,690
compromised it's believed the attacker

812
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,850
stole the customer information from one

813
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,040
of their databases database stolen it's

814
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,690
not a master customer database not all

815
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,390
customers are there and the mailing

816
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,190
address is not present in the database

817
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,310
right now we're altom utley gonna have

818
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,960
to go out and do something here the

819
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,100
order is going to incur costs

820
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,750
identifying the mailing addresses of all

821
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,420
the impacted customers

822
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,620
and in the order is gonna have to mail

823
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,270
the customers notifications they're

824
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,710
gonna have to contract a call center

825
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,390
because there's always an 800 number for

826
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,770
you to call and they're gonna have to

827
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,330
provide credit monitoring services to

828
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,890
you right under most state laws today

829
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,620
does this get included in the cost of

830
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,390
the incident how many folks say yes by

831
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,810
show of hands now this is a very

832
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,730
interesting case here right because and

833
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,650
and by the way the majority was yes in

834
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,710
the room here I'll mention here that I

835
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,480
think this is a really interesting case

836
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,360
because doesn't this then

837
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,190
disproportionately disadvantage or

838
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,590
disproportionately increase incident

839
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,510
costs for those that have to send

840
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,860
notifications right so if you're

841
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,990
processing data that under state law

842
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,460
requires you to send a notification

843
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,920
doesn't that then artificially increase

844
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,960
the cost of your incident and prevent us

845
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
from doing an apples to apples

846
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
comparison with someone that doesn't now

847
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,210
again I'm not necessarily saying this

848
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,400
isn't be included in the cost I'm just

849
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,390
kind of thrown around here and

850
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,070
highlighting some of the problems face

851
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,020
what about regulatory fines alright so

852
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,030
we've got a hospital how appropriate

853
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,290
since we're actually in a medical

854
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,420
building right our medical education

855
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,760
building Elise they process phot data

856
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,130
and HHS Health and Human Services finds

857
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,410
them a half million dollars for the for

858
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,660
the incident should the spine be

859
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,180
included in the incident reporting costs

860
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,310
how many folks say yes every folks say

861
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,470
no well the noes have it there that one

862
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,660
was unanimous all right and again you

863
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,800
know I'm gonna come back here and say I

864
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,150
don't have a right answer this is not a

865
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,610
black and white issue all right today

866
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,980
it's it's basically a basic a hodgepodge

867
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,320
right so should the fine be included I

868
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,300
again I think possibly no and I'll talk

869
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,640
more about this we go what a lawsuits

870
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,930
man these are more common every day

871
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,810
right every day so an organization that

872
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,160
processes health data they get

873
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,990
compromised results in a loss of

874
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,630
availability of critical pH I by the way

875
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,410
even if your pH I isn't compromised in

876
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,090
the sense that it's stolen by a third

877
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,340
party if a third party can simply block

878
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,260
access to it that is a that is a final

879
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,000
event all right so that's actually

880
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,530
considered a HIPAA breach as well if

881
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,840
your doctors can't access your ph i

882
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,560
right

883
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,080
doctors yeah health care providers

884
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,970
whoever has ultimately covered on that

885
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,580
business associate agreement or be it

886
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,780
patients claim this outage impacted

887
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,310
their care and they suffered injury pain

888
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,080
and suffering and and the insurer

889
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,200
settles a class act

890
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,960
lawsuit for nine million dollars an

891
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,820
organization in kirb lost productivity

892
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,350
obviously in dealing with us lost time

893
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,760
to trial prep because they had to put

894
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,140
people you know through the wringer

895
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,420
there on on doing depositions and

896
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,520
whatnot they had legal fees they have to

897
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,630
cover some of the nine million dollar

898
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,160
payout with the insurer everybody has a

899
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,360
deductible what about this is it in how

900
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,250
many folks they in how many folks say

901
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,100
out all right that's about even and out

902
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,180
about a thirty you didn't vote at all

903
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,980
right and so and I don't blame you

904
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,150
because this one's a hard one as well

905
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,220
all right should we be certainly from a

906
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,080
legal standpoint if we use the proximate

907
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,960
cause right proximate cause side I

908
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,960
definitely but for the incident we would

909
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,340
not have had the lawsuit would not have

910
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,080
had these you know these these issues

911
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,150
right at the same time if you're in an

912
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,800
industry that's less likely to be sued

913
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,290
all right obviously then this skews your

914
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,420
incident response costs alright so this

915
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,530
is kind of what we're trying to get to

916
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,360
you know we talk about apples to apples

917
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,940
there's a lot today that well we have

918
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,380
issues with all right and this is one of

919
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,180
our big issues so one of the ways that

920
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,160
we and that we proposed to deal with

921
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,140
this is that as we think more about

922
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,180
these cost categories obviously

923
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,830
different businesses different lines of

924
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,540
work have different regulatory bodies

925
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,340
they have different susceptibility to

926
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,980
lawsuits right and certainly they have

927
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,420
different susceptibility to breach

928
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,090
notification costs and so we and we

929
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,920
actually are proposing here is we

930
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,510
proposed a 4-tuple solution to the

931
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,580
problem where we no longer report a

932
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,620
single number report four numbers or up

933
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,510
to four numbers right and a four tuple

934
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,040
or four tuple depending on which part of

935
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,840
the country you come from we're looking

936
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,490
at incident response costs the actual

937
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,200
cost to perform the incident response

938
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,880
and we'll talk more about some things

939
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,110
that are in and out on that a little bit

940
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,780
later all right breach notification is a

941
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,940
separate cost the lawsuit cost whether

942
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,670
that's legal you know the actual legal

943
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,710
cost deposition trial prep lost

944
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,200
productivity and then the regular oven

945
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
all ultimately the payout print

946
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,680
potential payout and then regulatory

947
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,270
fines right so what are we dealing with

948
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,280
there so we've proposed a 4-tuple now

949
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,570
you can add all those numbers together

950
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,090
and still provide the same one number

951
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,650
that you're providing today it just

952
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,290
gives us some granularity around that

953
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,940
data without having to do line-item

954
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,530
reporting alright and this is what a lot

955
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,630
of companies don't want to do they don't

956
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,070
want to come in and say look here's our

957
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,930
let's open up the books let's open the

958
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,430
kimono a little bit and show everybody

959
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,980
how

960
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,540
we perform that incident response I

961
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,040
wouldn't want to do that for any of my

962
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,710
customers if I were ever breached for

963
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,309
ever breach you're all fired but if and

964
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,710
but seriously if we have a you know if

965
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,030
we have an incident I wouldn't want to

966
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,980
open my books at the same time I

967
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,230
recognize that me not being transparent

968
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,030
with this is actually hurting our

969
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,980
industry it's hurting our ability to

970
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,600
perform again these apples to apples

971
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,490
comparisons and so what we're trying to

972
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,590
do here if we can standardize a method

973
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,600
basically standardize a method for this

974
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,730
reporting what's in what's out again

975
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,950
here without without having to do life

976
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,150
and I'm accounting without having two

977
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,980
giveaways potentially sensitive

978
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,169
information all right we can still

979
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,540
understand how we stack up against other

980
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,700
organizations how did this breach impact

981
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,890
us versus a breach impacting somebody

982
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,049
else in the industry and so one of the

983
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,370
questions that I had as I was developing

984
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,470
this I've certainly run around with a

985
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,820
couple of reporters and a couple other

986
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,010
folks in the industry they've asked hey

987
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,350
why will organizations use this in the

988
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,690
first place and my number one answer has

989
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,210
to be insurance I think that once we

990
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,530
push this into the field

991
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,360
I think insurers are going to force

992
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,429
people to start using this I hope that's

993
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,650
the case right we'll see they may come

994
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,940
up with their own standard and look if

995
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,980
that's what happens rock on take it away

996
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,660
from me and roll with us right all I

997
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,370
care about is the problem gets fixed I

998
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,870
don't care who does it and whose name is

999
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,179
behind us right again I throw this out

1000
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,770
here knowing that people are gonna pick

1001
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,049
on it people are gonna say well I don't

1002
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,940
agree with that piece and whatever rock

1003
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,140
on at least we're starting the

1004
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,760
conversation right and I'll talk more

1005
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,799
about that kind of as we close here but

1006
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,840
you know I'll mention here that those

1007
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,940
are reporting the instant response costs

1008
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,220
we can challenge them to provide insight

1009
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,809
into their accounting methods all right

1010
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,309
so I've got two reporters that as this

1011
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:02,429
goes live on Monday as this goes live on

1012
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,290
Monday have two reporters I wonder with

1013
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,510
Reuters and I'll leave out the other

1014
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,679
organization because I'm gonna give up

1015
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,410
the reporter yet but basically that will

1016
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,809
are gonna start asking hey what

1017
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,640
accounting standard did you use as they

1018
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
are reported when they say hey I ran

1019
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,120
some more event this cost us you know

1020
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,910
whatever $300,000 they're gonna ask did

1021
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,380
you actually use an accounting method to

1022
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,630
report this or did you make it up right

1023
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,340
and I like that and then start putting

1024
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,690
that into stories all right saying

1025
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,730
either this number is backed by an

1026
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,140
accounting method or it's not now

1027
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,059
currently as far as I'm aware this

1028
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,980
is it right that's kind of why we're

1029
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,720
doing this here but but again if you

1030
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,759
have better ideas please take it and run

1031
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,919
with it because you know rock on all

1032
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,210
right I just care that the problem gets

1033
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,769
fixed again not who fixes it

1034
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:45,840
I certainly am going to encourage folks

1035
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,610
certainly my employees and others in the

1036
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,289
industry here to go ask legislators and

1037
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:51,360
press and regulatory bodies to demand

1038
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,009
the use of some standard accounting

1039
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,710
format right and even if you're never

1040
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,299
gonna share data externally even if

1041
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,559
you're never gonna go to the press and

1042
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,330
say oh yeah or investors and you don't

1043
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,730
have a regulatory requirement to share

1044
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,769
the cost of your incident response at

1045
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:07,080
least internally use these numbers right

1046
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,879
so that you can compare so when you go

1047
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,739
to that board meeting you can say yeah

1048
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,480
look our breach was bad but it was

1049
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,190
nothing like this other one and you can

1050
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,469
actually do an apples-to-apples

1051
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,520
comparison and by the way tell them what

1052
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,139
you know and what you don't know all

1053
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,429
right today if you go up and you try to

1054
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,918
do an apples-to-apples comparison one of

1055
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,810
your don't knows it better be I don't

1056
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,339
know what accounting format they used

1057
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,560
all right and I don't know what

1058
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,329
accounting format I used either right

1059
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,949
yeah because quote we made it all up

1060
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,500
right so I'm talking about case studies

1061
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,869
case studies of ridiculous breach cost

1062
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,060
and this is kind of what led us a couple

1063
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,649
of these actually led us to thinking

1064
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,569
about this problem specifically well

1065
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,069
that and the Atlanta ransomware thing

1066
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:46,349
I've got an organization whose breached

1067
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:49,020
they lost regulated data the regulators

1068
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,790
and the cyber insurance company asked

1069
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,349
why the organization didn't have a CCO

1070
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,719
and the organization has a policy and

1071
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,399
it's actual in writing policy that any

1072
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,560
new headcount must be funded for the

1073
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,810
first three years in the budgetary

1074
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,390
process before they hire somebody now if

1075
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,800
you're looking around at what CISOs make

1076
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,619
this is a lot of money right

1077
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,270
particularly three years of that is a

1078
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,829
lot of money and so you know what they

1079
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:12,780
did they took three years of the new CSO

1080
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,599
story not just his not just his actual

1081
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,940
dollar salary but his benefits all right

1082
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,980
so all the benefits the stock options

1083
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,380
stock whatever that they have ownership

1084
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,060
options they're they're not publicly

1085
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,950
traded right but but regardless here

1086
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,260
they said okay cool right and that's

1087
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,700
what they reported as part of the breach

1088
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,920
costs this is their largest single line

1089
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,690
item this is somebody workman so I do

1090
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,150
see the line items largest single line

1091
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,300
item by far by far in their incident

1092
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,760
response that's obviously skewed the

1093
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,140
incident response northward I'm going to

1094
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,220
tell you is by more than a million

1095
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,770
dollars

1096
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,990
right most CISOs are making a pretty fat

1097
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,610
chunk of change there right and it

1098
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,720
certainly was well over a million

1099
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,490
dollars and that pushes that breach cost

1100
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,520
up here we had a breached or what was

1101
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,020
being acquired as part of merger and

1102
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,730
acquisition and we've been doing a lot

1103
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,010
of M&A work recently fact my office is

1104
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,830
filled with stuff from a failed M&A but

1105
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,900
basically here we've got the acquisition

1106
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,750
that was complete this external capital

1107
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,820
infusion company here basically this

1108
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,370
they basically bought up a smaller

1109
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,740
company and so now we've got this larger

1110
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,210
conglomerate which is a holding company

1111
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,160
the holding company is getting a capital

1112
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,800
infusion right and this capital infusion

1113
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,250
is not gonna give away the exact number

1114
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,330
here but let's say it's around a billion

1115
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,190
dollars over four years right so not

1116
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,440
chump change they're very very concerned

1117
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,120
about the capital infusion it turns out

1118
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,700
because of some tax law changes the

1119
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,620
company that's gonna do the capital

1120
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,050
infusion needs to do a quick right they

1121
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,280
have to do it sooner than later which

1122
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,810
means the incident response has to wrap

1123
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,550
up very very quickly

1124
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,260
right now this is an external factor

1125
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,330
here that obviously has nothing to do

1126
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,890
with the complexity of the incident if

1127
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,600
we're measuring incident response costs

1128
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,760
what we should be comparing here if

1129
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,470
we're doing apples to apples comparisons

1130
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,650
is how involved was the actual response

1131
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,300
and that should actually tell us

1132
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,430
something about how involved were the

1133
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,260
actual attackers how sophisticated were

1134
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,970
the attackers how much anti forensics

1135
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,010
did they use we should be able to tell

1136
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,570
something from these numbers if we can't

1137
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,220
then we shouldn't care that the numbers

1138
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,080
are even being published we should stop

1139
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,060
asking for them right we shouldn't be we

1140
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,080
shouldn't even be tracking them

1141
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,430
internally if we don't care right

1142
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,260
clearly we do right I'm not obviously

1143
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,510
not not advocating for that but they

1144
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,100
needed to get this done quickly because

1145
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,540
of the tax law changes and so what they

1146
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,790
did is they put a private charter jet on

1147
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,830
standby for three weeks to fly hard

1148
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,960
drives and equipment back and forth from

1149
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,270
the compromised site to the forensics

1150
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,790
lab now I don't know if you've looked at

1151
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,860
a charter in a Gulfstream for weeks at a

1152
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,630
time but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you

1153
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,730
it ain't cheap alright but if you need

1154
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,680
something they're faster than FedEx all

1155
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,110
right obviously there's a way to do it

1156
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,790
right if if priority overnight is not

1157
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,830
fast enough for you there's priority by

1158
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,620
g6 all right and so now I have to step

1159
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,300
back and say is this sane is this

1160
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,820
something that that helps us understand

1161
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,980
the the cost of the incident all right

1162
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,300
now the reason

1163
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,040
some of these ridiculous stories is that

1164
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,380
you know again without having seen these

1165
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,840
firsthand right I would never look at a

1166
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,030
number like Atlanta's 17 million dollars

1167
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,650
and wonder and by the way none of these

1168
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,970
are Atlanta none of these stories I'm

1169
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,040
telling you or Atlanta but I have to

1170
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,020
wonder then without seeing that it's in

1171
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,980
the 17 million dollars based on all the

1172
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,750
craziness that I've seen before now I'm

1173
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,490
kind of like okay well what am I not

1174
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,920
seeing so here I got an org here with

1175
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,410
ransomware database for the document

1176
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,910
management system got encrypted right

1177
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,380
this is a this is a really really

1178
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,940
interesting one it turns out a CTO has

1179
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,500
been unhappy with the existing document

1180
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,900
management system for some time yes and

1181
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,340
you all know where this is going right

1182
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,550
and so oh man I left the charter jet in

1183
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,540
there well anyway let me leave that out

1184
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,890
blood the whole copy paste slide thing

1185
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,940
as we're building the story out there

1186
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,980
there's probably one somewhere else or

1187
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,480
so I'm gonna CTO replace the document

1188
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,230
management system

1189
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,930
yay slides anyway so CTO then replace

1190
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,220
the document management system for

1191
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,310
nearly half a million dollars and

1192
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,660
included that in there this is a capital

1193
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,250
improvement that they made right where

1194
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,930
they ripped out to the Lipton ship

1195
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,670
really ripped out one system put a

1196
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,950
different system in place and they were

1197
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,080
like yeah that clearly I mean and and

1198
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,060
from a legal standpoint I want to come

1199
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,940
back to this as ridiculous as this is

1200
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,340
but for the incident that took the

1201
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,200
existing document management system

1202
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,450
offline they would not yet have made

1203
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,270
that change right you know Lana's case

1204
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,540
but for the ransomware that finally made

1205
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,250
them come into the 21st century and

1206
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,950
deploy EDR on their systems right they

1207
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,450
wouldn't have needed more powerful

1208
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,910
systems to run day to day ops along with

1209
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,610
the EDR software right so again from a

1210
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,340
legal standpoint this might actually

1211
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,440
pass muster right from a common-sense

1212
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,870
standpoint from a does this help us

1213
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,220
understand the numbers cuz now I got a

1214
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,870
half million dollars jammed in here

1215
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,580
right jammed into my incident response

1216
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,530
cost that has nothing to do with the

1217
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,470
incident all right so I don't look at

1218
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,660
number four here we've got an organized

1219
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,490
by a struts vulnerability this was not

1220
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,860
Equifax for you before you guess because

1221
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,060
I can't say struts today whether

1222
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,210
somebody like Equifax right anyway so

1223
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,770
the org decided that they don't want to

1224
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,750
rely on any Java frameworks now I gotta

1225
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,160
tell you I don't actually disagree with

1226
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,910
this I think

1227
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,549
Joba I think job is a lot like the

1228
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:16,299
Hindenburg right airship travel largely

1229
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:18,640
stopped we had safe airships right and

1230
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,230
and even the Hindenburg at the time was

1231
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,869
known to not be a safe airship but you

1232
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:25,420
can't get people on safe airships and

1233
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,890
the reason for that is because they all

1234
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,750
saw that movie real right even back in

1235
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,970
the in the 1910s here they all saw the

1236
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,980
movie real of people burning up in the

1237
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,450
Hindenburg and they're like nope not me

1238
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,390
that take my toys I'm going home I'll

1239
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,890
find a different way to fly all right

1240
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,170
and other people like no no it's safe

1241
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,180
this one's safer and this reminds a lot

1242
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,579
of Jabba we're like hey don't worry

1243
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:48,280
about all the stuff you saw before this

1244
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,710
Java is better right and consistently

1245
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,849
we're finding out people are still

1246
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,680
crashing and burning with it anyway the

1247
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,480
organ decides that they don't want to

1248
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,490
use Java anymore and they say hey this

1249
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,470
is unacceptable risk I'm all about the

1250
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,819
whole risk modeling thing at threat

1251
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,250
modeling I like this the order decided

1252
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,660
to go refactor the application and

1253
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,160
modernize it and rewrite it using the

1254
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,869
rails framework and I won't get into

1255
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,940
security issues with rails but that's a

1256
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,559
whole separate topic for another time

1257
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,960
it's not necessarily better okay it

1258
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,920
actually is better because the

1259
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,410
alternative was Java but the cost for

1260
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,329
refactoring the application deploying

1261
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,740
and this is the one that blew me away

1262
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,640
training the staff on the new workflow

1263
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,380
mind blown right this is a big

1264
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,359
organization and they had thousands of

1265
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,980
staff that they trained on the new

1266
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,589
workflow in like 16-hour like two days

1267
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:34,450
sessions on how to use the new system

1268
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,400
internally all right this is a this is a

1269
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,230
core piece of their business and they

1270
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,000
trained thousands of staff on this and

1271
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,190
counted all that lost productivity time

1272
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,950
as part of the incident response now you

1273
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,779
got to step back then and say and this

1274
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:48,069
is why I'm telling the reason I'm

1275
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,390
telling you this is say when you see

1276
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,279
these numbers in the press they are

1277
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,130
absolutely meaningless today all right

1278
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,349
if I came in and I offer the spine

1279
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,089
gentleman up front I don't know your

1280
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:00,010
name or anything what's your name wrong

1281
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,960
if I came in and offered ROM ROM are you

1282
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,869
looking for a job not really but but for

1283
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:05,920
the right amount of money you come work

1284
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,779
for me all right I mean there's there's

1285
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:09,010
got to be and everybody's got a number

1286
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,950
right and if I came in if I came in and

1287
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,329
I told you that I'd give you 3 million

1288
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,190
flintlocks to come over and work with me

1289
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,730
today would you

1290
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,260
Flynn Parkes

1291
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,990
no right exactly all right so at 3

1292
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,490
million Flint Park sorry I mean you

1293
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,130
wouldn't and why because we don't know

1294
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,430
what a flume Park is all right so if on

1295
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,290
the other hand I said I'll give you

1296
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,910
three million dollars asterisk asterisk

1297
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,040
on the backside there to come work for

1298
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,360
three million dollars a year

1299
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,670
severed certain terms and conditions are

1300
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,300
you good

1301
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,450
do we have a deal we've got a deal

1302
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,320
without knowing what the terms and

1303
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,570
conditions are that's a bad plan right

1304
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,010
and so when we start talking about

1305
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,720
numbers here right it's easy to throw a

1306
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,950
number out and be like Brahma

1307
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,720
but without context what is a flume

1308
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,370
floor what are the terms and conditions

1309
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,990
we don't really know all right in the

1310
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,940
terms and conditions in in our Westland

1311
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,160
hypothetical examples here are well what

1312
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,270
the heck is going on on the backend

1313
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,190
Karine what what are people putting into

1314
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,290
these numbers so number five here Orbis

1315
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,760
compromise fails a detective for more

1316
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,090
than 18 months it's obvious obvious that

1317
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,560
log review would have detected the

1318
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,490
intruder almost immediately all right so

1319
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,720
24/7 sock makes all the difference in

1320
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,900
the world the org first decides finally

1321
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,910
decides eNOS em and they go purchase it

1322
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,680
using instant response money and then

1323
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,180
the order realizes the SEM only works

1324
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,700
that some monitors it so they hire a 24

1325
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,710
by 7 sock and so what they do then is

1326
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,000
they take all this technical debt

1327
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,260
because that's what all this is all

1328
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,030
right they didn't have a sim and then

1329
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,590
they put a sim in place and it cost them

1330
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,200
I think around 280 something like that

1331
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,000
thousand dollar and then they realized

1332
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,290
that 280 thousand dollar investment

1333
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,730
doesn't really matter if they don't use

1334
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,670
it what are the odds right and so what

1335
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,810
they then went ahead and did is they

1336
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,430
said okay we need a sock to handle all

1337
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,470
that right that wall gagra Gatien isn't

1338
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,000
magic right somebody actually has to

1339
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,950
monitor for alerts and what do you know

1340
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,070
all right anyway so why don't talk about

1341
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,240
a couple of principles here all right

1342
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,000
that we look at for for abracadabra it's

1343
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,250
that only items directly related to the

1344
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,140
incident can be count an incident cost

1345
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,540
reporting instant response remediation

1346
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,400
cost should not be used under any

1347
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,530
circumstances to cover up for technical

1348
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,230
debt if the organization has failed to

1349
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,810
use basic security best practices or

1350
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,150
even IT best practices is the case

1351
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,700
commonly commonly is all right you don't

1352
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,580
get to cover up those failures in an

1353
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,200
incident response plan that's again what

1354
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,610
we're watching the city of Atlanta do

1355
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,070
right now a lot of people come back and

1356
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,870
like hey man our staff was horribly

1357
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,060
underprepared for this we need training

1358
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,950
I awoke a training is technical dead as

1359
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,660
well right training is a regular line

1360
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,400
item you need to be budgeting for every

1361
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,660
year all right

1362
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,610
whether it's internal training external

1363
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,780
whatever you're doing they're right you

1364
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,850
need to be doing the training anyway so

1365
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,200
as we look there we want to make sure

1366
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,500
that that we've got that got included

1367
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,970
but but not in the actual incident

1368
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,800
response reporting budgeted for yes

1369
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,440
included our incident response no right

1370
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,410
I work with sans I know a company that

1371
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,300
after they got breached one of the

1372
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,440
things that they did is they went out

1373
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,330
and bought I think around a million

1374
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,010
dollars worth of vouchers from sans and

1375
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,600
of course that also got included their

1376
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,550
instant response calls right so while I

1377
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,290
love to see their people in my training

1378
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,090
I kind of step back and I'm like you're

1379
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,580
living a lie right now I don't blame any

1380
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,140
of them right they're not responsible

1381
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,970
for any of that but but the reality is

1382
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,770
right they're there because of the

1383
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,630
incident now I'm not knocking at either

1384
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,730
I think it makes a lot of sense look if

1385
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,590
if I consistently when I left my

1386
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,690
building at night I love to walk around

1387
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,370
the park or walk around the track of the

1388
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,990
park across the street from our from our

1389
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,760
building if every time I went to walk

1390
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,140
over there I got my butt kicked by

1391
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,400
somebody right somebody came out and

1392
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,320
mugged me I would do one of two things

1393
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,600
either stop doing it I can't just stop

1394
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,130
doing business right so in the business

1395
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,840
analogy it doesn't work or go take

1396
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,270
karate lessons right I go figure out a

1397
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,070
way to go remediate that right

1398
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,120
but I wouldn't build those karate

1399
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,910
lessons back to my company right and I

1400
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,110
think that's kind of where we're coming

1401
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,820
back here right now in this case the

1402
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,500
company pays for the training no matter

1403
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,090
what but now we're kind of stepping back

1404
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,190
and saying from which pot of money does

1405
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,840
that come all right all the way it's

1406
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,400
gonna be the incident or sorry the yes

1407
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,650
security team in most cases anyway

1408
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,630
that's gonna get that budget right but

1409
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,130
now again we're trying to come down and

1410
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,920
highlight the highlight that apples to

1411
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,810
apples comparisons so their numbers were

1412
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,240
meaningful and so this is another big

1413
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,280
one for me you can't skim coffee you

1414
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,410
have to report all costs not some costs

1415
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,240
all costs directly associated with the

1416
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,820
incident right don't report costs for

1417
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,320
replacing infrastructure even though it

1418
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,910
was old alright this is another favorite

1419
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,520
of ours we've done I don't know how many

1420
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,860
now where we get the incident there I oh

1421
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,190
oh Server 2003 and then they're

1422
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,200
basically uplifting replacing the

1423
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,700
hardware replacing the software

1424
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,860
refactoring applications and you know

1425
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,150
because I got to replace this stuff

1426
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,860
because we can't patch it and it's like

1427
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,000
dude you couldn't patch it the week

1428
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,470
before the incident the only thing

1429
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,070
that's change

1430
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,080
is that you've got budgeting available

1431
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,940
now and again there's nothing wrong with

1432
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,470
taking advantage of budgeting you should

1433
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,360
do that you should just be honest about

1434
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,890
where that money's coming from all right

1435
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,360
again don't report it as part of the

1436
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,310
incident you're robbing the industry

1437
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,690
right so I'm just you you're not just

1438
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,430
lying to yourself you're robbing the

1439
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,130
industry of data and come back here note

1440
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,230
that the cost for training never ever

1441
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,720
ever fall into incident response costs

1442
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,940
ever even if sap doesn't know how to do

1443
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,080
an incident response by the ways a

1444
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,000
horrible plan don't do this but I've

1445
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,820
seen it done don't schedule your people

1446
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,290
for the next sans incident response

1447
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,490
class like if you get breached on

1448
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,590
Thursday you discover the compromised on

1449
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,790
Thursday and you find out your people

1450
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,200
can't do their own incident response

1451
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,050
don't fly them to a 508 incident

1452
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,030
response class starting on Monday so

1453
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,620
they can learn how to do it and fly back

1454
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,850
the next week and assume they're gonna

1455
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,830
do Incident Response all right that is

1456
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,810
not gonna happen although I've taught

1457
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:38,290
that class

1458
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,330
I've taught those people and gosh if

1459
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,450
that happens to you quit just quit right

1460
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,090
go find another job someplace where

1461
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,680
people don't want to abuse you that

1462
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,460
happened to you oh quit after the class

1463
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,710
yeah I that totally wrong god I mean get

1464
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,870
the training and then quit whatever that

1465
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,620
sounds ethically questionable but don't

1466
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,020
report costs for refactoring existing

1467
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,580
in-house applications to resolve

1468
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,410
security issues I feel like I shouldn't

1469
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,870
have to say any of this but again I

1470
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,250
didn't have to dig deep to grab those

1471
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,680
six stories of fail right it would be

1472
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,900
really easy to go grab 600 stories of

1473
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,920
fail when it comes to cost accounting

1474
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,030
penetration test oh my gosh we'd love to

1475
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,920
do red team work we love it and we love

1476
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,780
to do pen test work but but you don't

1477
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,310
get to count those costs either right

1478
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,170
now I know during an incident and by the

1479
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,120
way this is actually a best practice

1480
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,470
that I don't have a good data for right

1481
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,750
if you get breached if you get hit

1482
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,190
all right somebody compromises you and

1483
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,950
they steal your data you definitely had

1484
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,350
an unresolved security hole and if you

1485
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,760
didn't know about that from a previous

1486
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,200
pen test perhaps because you've never

1487
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,770
had one then it makes sense that someone

1488
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,930
should look for other holes in your

1489
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,360
infrastructure all right this is my wife

1490
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,190
loved use the skin cancer analogy again

1491
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,690
I mentioned I'm a medic definitely had

1492
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,010
some medical training back in the day

1493
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,960
and if you ever get diagnosed with skin

1494
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,490
cancer right I'm just gonna tell you it

1495
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,670
is a it is a very interesting visit all

1496
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,400
right

1497
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,520
and you get to go in and drop trou and

1498
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,320
go completely naked and they look at

1499
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,470
every fold of skin everywhere in your

1500
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,660
body right they're looking all over the

1501
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,710
place they're making sure because

1502
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,510
because skin cancer is tough to

1503
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,840
eradicate like attackers and our bodies

1504
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,369
are amazingly complex than the skin is

1505
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:20,630
the largest organ in the body and all

1506
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,670
that stuff and and they will go fold by

1507
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,290
fold including the ones you would prefer

1508
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,900
not to expose looking for other evidence

1509
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,400
to skin cancer you should get a pen test

1510
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,740
right you shouldn't call it part of a

1511
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,000
breach response part your incident

1512
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,440
response right this is good practice

1513
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,750
right I likewise the doctors don't put

1514
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,160
that exam under their bill for

1515
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,530
chemotherapy because again that's not

1516
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,720
providing good data back to our insurers

1517
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,340
now doctors do all kinds of other nasty

1518
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,480
stuff with cost accounting we're not

1519
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,960
getting into but yeah anyway so let's

1520
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,070
talk about the incident cost breakdown

1521
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,830
what's acceptable what's not our friends

1522
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,900
of media costs all right this is a this

1523
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,130
is a great example here we're actually

1524
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,070
dealing with this somebody dropped a

1525
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,210
backpacker trailer up to her office a

1526
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,290
couple of weeks ago and dropped off a

1527
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,960
data center and I so wish I was making

1528
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,750
that up but but I'm totally not and they

1529
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,980
apparently had had a incident and they

1530
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,440
they basically a company that acquired

1531
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,330
them set up we don't need to investigate

1532
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,609
that and so they went ahead and replaced

1533
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:18,470
all the equipment this equipment was

1534
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,000
stolen to release the old equipment and

1535
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,590
sitting in a warehouse someplace and so

1536
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,090
they just came and dropped it off and I

1537
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,740
hey good luck with that or like Haiti

1538
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,540
I've IT people that IKEA we did but we

1539
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,550
were really happy as we fired him

1540
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,830
we have Network Maps they're like yeah I

1541
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,470
think so they're around like a 150 or

1542
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,180
200 VMs I'm not really sure running on

1543
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,160
these computing servers and I'm like are

1544
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,690
you kidding me all right so we've got

1545
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,160
all these sand units now all right I've

1546
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,260
got a bunch of sand storage area network

1547
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,200
units sitting around and now I have to

1548
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,850
kind of step back and say how much media

1549
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,859
are we really gonna buy for this instant

1550
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:51,230
response now if I just need to capture a

1551
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:52,700
couple of machines that totally makes

1552
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,160
sense right if on the other hand you

1553
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,260
have this weird one-off scenario I'm

1554
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,850
confident that I can work my entire

1555
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,980
career and I will never have somebody

1556
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,600
back up to my office with an 18-wheeler

1557
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,400
again and drop off a data center I'm

1558
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,690
confident that's never gonna happen

1559
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,580
again if it does I quit

1560
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,640
and so I own the company and I quit but

1561
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,430
look vast majority of cases I shouldn't

1562
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,510
be going in buying

1563
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,540
forgery network appliances amir the sand

1564
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,890
from one to the other to do today to

1565
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,080
analysis i think it's a bad it's a

1566
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,210
fundamentally bad plan all right now

1567
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,320
well

1568
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,940
from a data preservation standpoint it's

1569
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,130
an awesome plan and if you're thinking

1570
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,260
i've liked more a storage area network

1571
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,860
appliances it's a great plan to go and

1572
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,010
jams hardware upgrades into your

1573
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,990
incident response costs right so here's

1574
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,880
a spot where even something simple like

1575
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,960
forensic media

1576
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,640
alright the media we need to preserve

1577
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,500
data alright cuz I'm certainly not gonna

1578
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,200
one-off image drives because there are

1579
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,060
hundreds and hundreds of hard drives and

1580
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,860
they Santa rays I'm not gonna image

1581
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,510
those off one at a time and and be like

1582
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,430
well let's hope we rebuild that raid and

1583
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,530
software that's not gonna happen that

1584
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,120
that's just that's that's just bad

1585
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,890
alright so again even something as

1586
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,320
simple as our friends of media costs in

1587
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,810
or out a tough problem I'll go ahead and

1588
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,130
say that I think the reason nobody's

1589
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,750
tackled this before is because it's a

1590
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,810
tough problem what about a SEM it's hard

1591
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,370
to investigate incident without a SEM

1592
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,900
we know this all right we do a lot of

1593
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,730
incident respond frequently and this

1594
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,560
will not surprise you many compromised

1595
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,030
organizations don't have a SEM to

1596
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,070
correlate logs I think there's a strong

1597
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,810
correlation here not a causation

1598
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,700
necessarily there's a strong correlation

1599
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,100
here what about a SEM deployment should

1600
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,330
we include that as part of the incident

1601
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:36,020
costs yeah yeah if it's used to help

1602
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,550
determine the scope of the incident

1603
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,010
probably yes maybe yes I mean what if we

1604
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,220
just try to deploy it temporarily no no

1605
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,830
ok there we go yeah so what if we just

1606
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,630
need to deploy it temporarily right so

1607
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,310
this is kind of where I draw the line if

1608
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,470
it's just being used to go in and do a

1609
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,290
data analysis for the incident we can do

1610
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,290
a Dropbox of Dropbox the company but but

1611
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,060
drop a box in place and work with a

1612
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,010
little less horsepower I think those

1613
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,540
costs are appropriate for the instant I

1614
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,380
don't think a long term

1615
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,120
half-a-million-dollar SEM deployment

1616
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,340
with lots of pros serve hours and all

1617
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,360
kinds of I don't think that's

1618
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,220
appropriate alright so again these are

1619
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,480
all questions that we as a community

1620
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,340
need to answer that's part of what the

1621
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,050
abracadabra framework is trying to start

1622
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,300
what about temporary EDR installations

1623
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,350
this one's another really interesting

1624
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,110
one here the organization doesn't have

1625
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,450
endpoint detection response so they're

1626
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,890
having a hard time getting visibility

1627
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,020
into their endpoints what do you do now

1628
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,640
right

1629
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,140
now clearly the answer is let's go to

1630
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,269
ploys to meet er right but do you buy

1631
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:34,579
full your licenses five-year licenses

1632
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:38,089
90-day licenses I mean do you gravitate

1633
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,279
to an EDR that specifically works with

1634
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,019
or is designed for this type of

1635
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,670
temporary installation for instant

1636
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,289
response and so again as we start

1637
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,640
looking at some of these costs as some

1638
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,289
stuff I just want to highlight as you

1639
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:50,720
know part of the why this is a hard

1640
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,760
problem I guess and so on throw out a

1641
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,890
call to action finally I'll mention here

1642
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,329
first off consider submitting your own

1643
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:58,490
breach horror stories I think the more

1644
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,619
look even without naming I think there's

1645
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:02,150
a lot of shaming that goes in here right

1646
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,880
as this video goes online and people are

1647
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,740
laughing about this the next time that

1648
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,029
you know because everybody laughed about

1649
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:10,099
the seaso example the next time that

1650
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:11,839
somebody tries to pull that stunt pull

1651
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,760
those shenanigans right and then you

1652
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,960
pull up the YouTube video and you're

1653
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,670
like dude here's a room full of security

1654
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,619
professionals laughing at you laughing

1655
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:20,510
at this idea I think that's a powerful

1656
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,700
deterrent I think it's a seriously

1657
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,650
powerful deterrent so I suggest

1658
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,569
submitting your own breach horror story

1659
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:27,710
share those right now

1660
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,470
again don't compromise an NDA don't do

1661
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,549
anything that's gonna cause you to lose

1662
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:33,740
your job or get sued right but but in

1663
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,450
the abstract talk about some of this

1664
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,819
stuff right as you review the framework

1665
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:38,960
if you come in and take a look at the

1666
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,980
framework you think we've missed

1667
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,630
something let me know what you think for

1668
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,190
sure if you have questions about a

1669
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,319
specific cost or whatever submit them

1670
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:46,400
over here we'll try and get you an

1671
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,710
answer back in five working days

1672
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,509
basically it appropriate to use this or

1673
00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:52,759
report this as a particular cost good to

1674
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:55,970
go call to actions number two here I'll

1675
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:57,319
mention that if you have an incident use

1676
00:54:57,319 --> 00:54:59,720
some accounting framework right again we

1677
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,279
were unable to find anything other than

1678
00:55:01,279 --> 00:55:03,200
this which is why this is the thing now

1679
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,839
but you know if some other accounting

1680
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,190
framework exists or you build a

1681
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,769
different one or whatever use it when

1682
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:10,880
you hear about an instant in the media

1683
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,799
where the costs are reported just ask

1684
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,049
ask the person who wrote the story ask

1685
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:16,789
the person telling you when I - we had

1686
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:17,450
this breach

1687
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,740
maybe you're networking over here like

1688
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,299
it was ten million dollars and ask them

1689
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:21,920
hey did you guys account that with some

1690
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,150
accounting method or did you just make

1691
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,130
stuff up I always like to throw in the

1692
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,019
back side of the or just make stuff up

1693
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,880
right because it really highlights what

1694
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,890
we're doing right I also have a similar

1695
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,420
opinion by the way that every time we

1696
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,309
discuss eternal blue in the press we

1697
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:36,079
absolutely and wired does this by the

1698
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,069
way they actually have an editorial

1699
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:38,630
standard that when they use the words

1700
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,059
eternal blue right after it says , the

1701
00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:42,110
leaked NSA

1702
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,360
poit right because I don't think we

1703
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,710
should discuss stuff like this without

1704
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,970
forgetting where it came from

1705
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,680
likewise here I don't think we should be

1706
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,660
discussing numbers without actually

1707
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,040
discussing where those numbers are

1708
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,480
coming from and how we're gonna deal

1709
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,580
with those and then try to make database

1710
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,500
decisions in InfoSec make sure that

1711
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,730
we're working with a religion and not

1712
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,730
science so if you want to help with this

1713
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,920
we're gonna publish this publish this

1714
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,450
shortly after the short layups of the

1715
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,010
presentation here I'll get up and throw

1716
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,080
the web page up there or activate the

1717
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,000
web page there and you can download what

1718
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,010
we have for the framework so far I'll go

1719
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,330
take a look at this tell us what you

1720
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,860
think tell us what we've missed or I am

1721
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,110
positive I'm positive that other people

1722
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,490
have incident response experience is

1723
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,340
different from mine that are probably

1724
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,900
you know cover things that we never even

1725
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,340
thought of because we never experienced

1726
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,380
this right again I've been working

1727
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,480
instant response a long time three weeks

1728
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,040
ago is the first time somebody ever

1729
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,690
dropped off a data center and said hey

1730
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,640
we know it's all turned off but let's go

1731
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,100
do forensics right it's never happened

1732
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,330
before I doubt it'll ever happen again

1733
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,340
you probably have other weird scenarios

1734
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,570
like that in case anybody's curious

1735
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,340
that's out that's the technical debt

1736
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,260
right dropping off or contractor and

1737
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,090
tractor-trailer to bring in your you

1738
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,530
already made the big mistake there that

1739
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,120
that that whole cost is is out you

1740
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,760
created a situation that said that's all

1741
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,210
I've got

1742
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,660
other than prizes door prizes right what

1743
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,830
am I supposed to do or the door prizes

1744
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,620
just like arbitrary is it arbitrary I

1745
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,900
can just give them away for I mean for

1746
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,700
whatever I guess huh I tell you what I'm

1747
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,440
gonna throw my a little walk screen up

1748
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,660
here well that was the plan let's try

1749
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,760
their hot corners now of course hot

1750
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,380
corners aren't gonna work why would they

1751
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,550
work I'll give you a choice surprises if

1752
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,630
you can tell me what this means

1753
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:23,180
pop pop rat sir all right yeah it does

1754
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,040
pop off the stack and return but why

1755
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,200
what's the pop hop rat thing anybody

1756
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:34,490
know X ooh close any particular function

1757
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:40,490
call okay we'll go to easier questions

1758
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,380
so the structure exception handling for

1759
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,810
anybody that's curious so Windows seh

1760
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,570
exploits right Oh Jeff you knew this why

1761
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,010
don't you raise your hand or did you and

1762
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,440
I missed it it wasn't fair okay it was

1763
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,730
like shooting fish in a barrel what Jeff

1764
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,790
said anyway so let's see

1765
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,790
and throw out a question here I don't

1766
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,380
have good questions for this here you do

1767
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,360
this right I'm gonna I'm gonna bail you

1768
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,190

1769
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:04,520
go

1770
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,290
okay I appreciate everybody coming out
