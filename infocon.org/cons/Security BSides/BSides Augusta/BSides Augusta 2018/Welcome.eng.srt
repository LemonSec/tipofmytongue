26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,930
okay why besides Augusta is better than

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,729
Derby con for those of you don't know

28
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,969
mr. Kennedy is the co-founder of Derby

29
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,640
con which was a little conference or do

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,469
you have it somewhere in Kentucky and

31
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,240
Kentucky yes recently but we're gonna

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,320
talk about why b-sides is better Nick

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,469
okay so first besides Augusta has all

34
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:49,710
the hype it's true that is that is our

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,710
theme for this year is all the hype we

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,390
didn't want to categorize the talks into

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,039
Red Team Blue team you're gonna have to

38
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,369
read through the awesome descriptions of

39
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,619
what the talks are to figure out what's

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,180
actually going on choose which talk to

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,259
your so you're gonna find defensive

42
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,780
talks offensive tax scattered throughout

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,520
them but we did put them in broad

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,380
categories so track 1 is going to be all

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,680
of the talks that are going to be

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,830
obsolete next year as a result of AI

47
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,330
pretty that's better than Derby con yeah

48
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,010
I mean a we don't have any ads all the

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,950
way I taught there you go so track 2 is

50
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,970
going to be talks that are going to be

51
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,950
obsolete as a result of blockchains

52
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,730
I have five tracks that

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,870
the blockchain so they can be redundant

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,980
no but did you have that at their week

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,480
on we did not have that at the recap

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,780
boom right open Derby con rather than

57
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,440
Derby gun

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,049
all right track three track three is

59
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,450
cyber cyber cyber because that's way

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,970
more cyber than Derby that's it's like

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,959
times ten cyber and then what do you

62
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,819
think this last track I mean if there

63
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,099
were if there were two things that are

64
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,410
the ultimate in hype in any good

65
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,840
security talk right it's you must have

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,120
sons ooh quotes so if I'm gonna wear a

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
fake beard and then start quoting things

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,319
as I do it the son smart you have to

69
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,489
have sons you quit and you have to have

70
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:08,650
for fun and profit in your title that's

71
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,810
right this entire track so my whole talk

72
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,569
is about fun and profit so it is yeah

73
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,079
you should really be in track for oh

74
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,540
that whole thing is a pack of you sons

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,760
ooh for funny boy wait oh okay you can

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,980
stay here we're simulcasting to track

77
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,680
for so you're good but it could be son

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,379
suit talk to me obviously by AE I as

79
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,090
well because they can just figure out

80
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,590
nice quotes and then apply those to

81
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,560
information security and then we're done

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,569
this is all track one it could be okay

83
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,540
so what you're saying is really our

84
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,799
titles are meaningless and you should

85
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,180
read through the bios to figure out

86
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,790
which talk you're supposed to be in yeah

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,970
okay

88
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,079

that has a lightning bolt next to it are

327
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,379
you x - no no I actually slowed it down

328
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,939
okay all right all right so that's

329
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:11,319
talked any questions about what we're

330
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:14,049
doing here like what's the lightning

331
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,949
bolt it's a question right there

332
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,959
are the talks recorded the talks are

333
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,350
being recorded and we do intend on

334
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,059
posting them online you can see all the

335
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,889
previous year's talks on

336
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,860
b-besides Augusta YouTube channel so I

337
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,480
think they should be online although

338
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,220
this is we're doing something new with

339
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,059
video equipment this year so we will see

340
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,709
all right it's not going to be as fast

341
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,480
as it has been in previous years for

342
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,610
sure but we will because we might have

343
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,449
put some things together in

344
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,559
post-production and get these linked

345
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,610
together but we are recording them and

346
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,410
we're gonna try and get these out on the

347
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,910
video as long as nothing goes wrong with

348
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,679
the technology and nothing everything

349
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,720
goes wrong with technology right then

350
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,240
yes they will be out there on the

351
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,899
interwebs other questions any question

352
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,730
about Derby con any

353
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:09,230
I I have yes you'll have to each ask

354
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,359
each of the splinters so b-sides of Gus

355
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,369
that has not collected up all the slides

356
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,899
and put together a process or ease so if

357
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,730
the presenters want to share them

358
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,199
usually they'll have a github or

359
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,249
something like that that they'll post

360
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:22,369
them on but yeah so you'll have people

361
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,689
want to raise your hand during each one

362
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,970
when they say questions that say can we

363
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,379
get a copy of the slides and then

364
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:33,439
they'll say yes or no okay it is being

365
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:33,980
recorded

366
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,480
oh this oh yeah you can also watch the

367
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,249
videos right so that the videos will

368
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:39,499
have the presentations in there as well

369
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:41,419
so you'll be able to see the slides in

370
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,189
the top as well from item for my talks I

371
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,259
intentionally put 15 links in each slide

372
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,509
that are in each each actual slide so

373
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:48,649
that people can't copy him down fast

374
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,449
enough you can just click on the screen

375
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,109
