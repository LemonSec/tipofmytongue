1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,520
thank you ashley

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
again i'm scout graffias and this is

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,000
level up the happiness of info security

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
teams that's great i didn't want to

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,440
mention upfront for

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
content accessibility purposes i'm

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,519
deliberately using

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,520
relatively large size fonts wherever

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
possible and i'll be describing also the

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
on-screen content there are a few slides

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,880
where

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
it'll be close to word for word but for

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
most slides that's not the case

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,920
want happier and more productive info

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,120
security teams and who doesn't

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,559
among other things that takes great

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,920
leadership and

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
proven strategies can give a real

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
advantage

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,120
so that's where the phases of team

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,719
development comes in

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
it's a framework that has stood the test

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
of time more on that in a moment because

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
it remains highly relevant and

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,120
beneficial

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
so if you're a

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
cyber security leader or you aspire to

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,559
be one

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
you're a member of a team or you might

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,239
be in one in the future and that covers

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,239
just about everybody else

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,600
or you're just looking to develop your

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
related skills

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
uh this talk which is based on dr bruce

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,439
wayne tuckman's model

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
but with a fresh angle

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
among other things zero percent theory

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,119
100 practical information

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,479
that you can use

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
to help lead and

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
uh fulfill successful uh team objectives

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
speaking of objectives

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
after this brief session you should

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
understand if you aren't familiar with

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,119
it already the five phases of team

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,600
development the characteristics of each

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,240
phase and then most importantly the

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
usable proven strategies you can use to

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
apply to teams

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,439
so here's the agenda this is how the

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
talk is structured

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
uh first is the introduction objectives

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
and agenda and we're almost done with

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
that

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
some about information about me as our

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
release of this talk and then the main

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
portion of this uh time together is the

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
five phases of team development followed

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
by a brief wrap up

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,439
a optional digital download takeaway

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,840
q a and feedback and speaking of q and

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,239
feedback i do care about your comments

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
and your questions tremendously but i

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
won't be watching them during the talk

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
i'll be focused on delivering the

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
content to you at the end of the talk

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
there's a section for q a and feedback

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
and we'll utilize whatever time we have

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,840
to

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
address any comments or questions you

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
have i look forward to them

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
and if we're short on time there's still

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
a way we can follow up with q a and

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
feedback which will be explained at the

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
end

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
so here's some of that information about

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,480
me

78
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,720
i'm a agile project management

79
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,959
practitioner consultant author and

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,920
speaker

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
and as of last week now in 23 countries

82
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
i've spoken either in person or

83
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
virtually last week was nepal

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
and i'm the ceo founder and principal

85

exceptional ppm and pmo solutions

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,920
and the last thing i want to mention

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
about the company quite proud of the

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
fact that 20 of the work that we do is

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
pro bono or no charge for charities and

91
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,959
nonprofits

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
okay and i'm a member of the ieee and

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
other professional associations have a

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,680
range of credentials

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
and a variety of different industries

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
i've worked in everything from

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
government entertainment consumer

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
products and more

99
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
and i'm honored that content from my

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,319
books

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,040
talks workshops and more

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
have been featured and used by a variety

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
of different organizations

104
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,599
and here are just a few and of these

105
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
i'm going to highlight a handful

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,400
there is the university of waterloo

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
microsoft oracle

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
computer weekly

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
rsa gartner

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
national academy of sciences and and

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,560
others

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
so that's enough about me

113
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
and my background here we are onto the

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
five phases of team development

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
so dr bruce wayne tuckman who received

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
his doctorate in psychology from

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,760
princeton

118
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
did extensive research on what was

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
originally called group dynamics but

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
shortly thereafter was also known as

121
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,399
team dynamics

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,798
group development team development so in

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,040
the context of this discussion those

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,080
terms

125
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,919
while they're nuanced they're they're

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,680
used interchangeably so i didn't want to

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
mention that

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
and he published his model way back in

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,400
65

130
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
you might ask why the heck are we

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
talking about something from 65 well

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
if that's your question i don't blame

133
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
you and here's the answer it's because

134
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,840
the model's still relevant and

135
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
beneficial today some examples in a

136
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,040
moment

137
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
but this talk does draw on my first hand

138
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
real world use of the model so it's not

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
some sort of theoretical construct that

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
i'm speaking of speaking about practical

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
use here right and

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,680
my talk is supported by research and

143
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
recommendations from a variety of

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
sources

145
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,199
over a hundred went into building this

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,520
presentation for you

147
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
and of them i drew the line and said 65

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,160
so 65 is the bibliography that i'm

149
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
sharing with you if you're interested

150
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
along with additional content at the end

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
of this talk

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,840
this is a subset of the 65 items in the

153
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,280
bibliography and um of these i'll just

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
mention a handful google forbes ibm mit

155
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
microsoft and many others went into this

156
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
talk

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
oh and i want to also say that many

158
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
publications

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
we'll often talk about the benefits

160
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,479
virtue and value of dr tuchman's model

161
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
and that's great because that's

162
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
reinforcement

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
but i'm delivering something different

164
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,800
in this talk i dug deep into the

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
literature which i know inside and out

166
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
ever since dr tuchman's model was

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
published in 65 and all the literature

168
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,080
since

169
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
and i took that as my responsibility to

170
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
be extremely familiar with the content

171
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
and extract from it

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
not just that as a great model but

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
exactly how you can use it in the real

174
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,479
world

175
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
well that's one aspect again which makes

176
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
us talk i believe unique

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,199
so to underscore the continuing

178
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,199
relevance and value of the model

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
many of those examples i showed you

180
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,720
here

181
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
on this slide were published in the last

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,479
10 years i say that because the model

183
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
came out in 65 so i think that's

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
important to make that distinction

185
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,720
furthermore many of them were published

186
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
in the last year so i did want to

187
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,479
mention that

188
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,479
and when it comes to models usually

189
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,720
putting them into some sort of a visual

190
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
context that you can navigate is often

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
helpful so that's what i've done here

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,199
and at least for me for this talk

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,759
clip art just does not work so no clip

194
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,280
art not doing that

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
and there's no stock photos

196
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
and there's absolutely no generic

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,520
content the only thing i borrowed from

198
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
is the

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
logo for the conference which is in the

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,759
lower right hand corner of the screen

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,400
other than that it's all custom content

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
and so here are the phases of team

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,599
development which is a custom visual to

204
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
give you the overview so as mentioned at

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,360
the top of the

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
presentation

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
i'm striving to use large font for

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
content accessibility wherever possible

209
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
obviously that's not the case here

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
because it will be very difficult or

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
maybe even impossible to make out the

212
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
text however in a moment we'll be

213
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
zooming in on their respective content

214
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,240
so the purpose of showing you this

215
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
visual on this uh slide here is to give

216
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
you the overview so i'll jump right into

217
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,720
that right now

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
at the top you see a level of

219
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,599
performance or productivity across sort

220
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,280
of the life cycle of

221
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
a project team and speaking of which dr

222
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
tuchman's model is agnostic in that it

223
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
applies to

224
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
traditional

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,560
agile all flavors of agile scrum and

226
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
kanban and hybrid models and all sorts

227
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
of things so whether

228
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
we're talking about a team we're talking

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
about maybe info security department

230
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
sort of as a team or we're talking about

231
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
info security project comprised of info

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
security team members or we're talking

233
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
about a project where it's sort of

234
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
cross-functional in that there's members

235
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
from marketing and legal and also info

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
security all those scenarios apply

237
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,879
to this model so i did want to mention

238
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
that

239
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
and below the um the the graph that you

240
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
see

241
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
and by the way happiness is correlated

242
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
with productivity

243
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
um and performance that may not be a

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
surprise to you but the literature is

245
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,519
very clear on that so i wanted to touch

246
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,760
on that briefly here maybe more later on

247
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,959
time permitting

248
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
and then you see the five phases going

249
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
from left to right

250
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,839
of team development forming stormy

251
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
norming performing and a journey

252
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
and below those markers the first row

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
are the characteristics these are the

254
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
things that are typically

255
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
seen or exhibited from the team in their

256
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
respective phase so if you're not

257
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
familiar with the model at all

258
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,880
or you're uncertain you can almost use

259
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,959
it as the diagnostic criteria to

260
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
identify where is the team

261
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,600
once you know that the role below that

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,160
are the strategies these are the proven

263
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
strategies that you can apply

264
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,040
to help the team advance its uh

265
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,600
performance productivity happiness and

266
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
that really means move on to the next

267
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
phase and the direction is typically

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
from uh from left to right

269
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
more and at the end if we have time but

270
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,440
that's the direction

271
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
and um custom visuals representing the

272
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
team

273
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
also accompany each phase so this is

274
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
sort of a model that dr tuchman's model

275
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
my customized version of his model but

276
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
this is about people right

277
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
so for inspiration i looked for

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
something that i could appropriately use

279
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
from 1965 when the model first came out

280
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
and i didn't find anything that

281
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
resonated with me that made sense for

282
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,160
this talk that could also be custom uh

283
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,880
or 66 67 68 but in 1969

284
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
these characters were introduced now

285
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
this is the lego version of these

286
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
characters so this is sort of the modern

287
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
incarnation of these characters but they

288
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
were introduced in 1969

289
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,720
and

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
these are rather expensive collectibles

291
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
i found out but anyways this is my

292
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
photograph of these characters and

293
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
they'll be accompanying the visual that

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
you saw earlier slides as we go through

295
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
the five phases of team development

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
and when we're off here we go first up

297
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
is forming so this is when i'll give a

298
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
few different examples because

299
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
i'm sure that the attendees for this

300
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
talk come from all kinds of environments

301
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,200
every company has their own take on

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
doing things so i'll give different

303
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,959
examples time permitting

304
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,399
as many as possible let's say that it is

305
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
a devops organization

306
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,279
and there are continuous just by nature

307
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,560
right but

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
there's somebody who has left the team

309
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
or somebody's joining the team so that

310
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
the performing stage or maybe it's the

311
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
very first time a group of people are

312
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
getting together or it is info security

313
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
kicking off an initiative or a project

314
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
there's all kinds of triggers really for

315
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,360
this forming phase but here we go

316
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
zooming in on the content

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,839
of the characteristics and also the

318
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,079
strategies that occur

319
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,360
with forming

320
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
so here are the things that are

321
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
typically seen

322
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
things are new and with that comes with

323
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
typically people are excited and they're

324
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,040
eager and they're socializing and

325
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
generally speaking the tone is there a

326
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,680
point safe topics but you know no matter

327
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
how much you're shared up front

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
on this project or this endeavor

329
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
whatever your company calls it the

330
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,160
sprint or iteration or whatever it is

331
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
still you know this is the very

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
beginning and it's perfectly normal

333
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
according to dr tuchman and others the

334
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
literature

335
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,839
for to have people

336
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,800
feel uncertain or unclear about

337
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,399
how the team is going to fulfill the

338
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,160
objective particularly if they've never

339
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,639
done something like it before right so

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,320
it's really a matter of degree depending

341
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
on the particulars of the situation but

342
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
how they're going to contribute and how

343
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
they're going to personally contribute

344
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,399
to the team's performances fulfilling

345
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,839
the objective so because of that it is

346
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,320
perfectly normal according to the

347
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,959
literature for some team members to have

348
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,120
some anxiety and some questioning but

349
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
here's what can be done about that

350
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
here somebody and that person could be

351
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,959
a info security manager it could be a

352
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
project manager it can be a scrum master

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,240
whoever

354
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
right it depends on the organization and

355
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,399
how you run your project or your

356
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
initiative or your work but somebody's

357
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
taking the lead and by that i mean

358
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
they're very very visible

359
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
right and an example of what might occur

360
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
is

361
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,079
doing introductions even on the team

362
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,160
that has worked together before can be

363
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
helpful it can be brief according to the

364
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
literature it doesn't need to be long

365
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,079
the whole exercise maybe is five or ten

366
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,000
minutes right and it's a one-time

367
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
endeavor for every time the team gets

368
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,519
together it's particularly helpful when

369
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
you have team members working on the

370
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,000
team who haven't worked together before

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
but even for people who have worked

372
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
together before it's still helpful some

373
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
companies do icebreakers some don't just

374
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,440
giving you that as as a idea for

375
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,519
consideration

376
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,000
sharing as much information as possible

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
as early as possible and by the way some

378
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,519
of these points here and on subsequent

379
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,959
phases you might uh reflect just seem

380
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,720
like a good practice or good common

381
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
sense and i if that's your view i would

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,959
agree entirely with you on that the

383
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,199
reason they're listed here is these are

384
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,199
the ones that are particularly powerful

385
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,199
and effective on helping the team get

386
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,120
out of forming and into subsequent

387
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,040
phases and the same goes when you see

388
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
strategies and subsequent uh

389
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
phases so please keep that in mind uh

390
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
success criteria so this may not apply

391
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
but i'll just give you an example

392
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
if it's true that this project must be

393
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,519
done

394
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
by november 1st if that's true some

395
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
companies do operate that way but just

396
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
as an example if that's true well you

397
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
want to know about that now right not a

398
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
month from now or two months now or

399
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,760
three months from now so you want to

400
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,560
know

401
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,639
uh sort of what the high level success

402
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
criteria or the requirements are

403
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,279
as early as possible it's okay for the

404
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
details to come out later which is very

405
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,480
typical but any high level uh

406
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,560
requirements or success criteria as

407
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
early as possible

408
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,000
and because of our time i'm going to

409
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,040
move on

410
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
and that brings us to storming and dr

411
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
tuchman says that regardless of the

412
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,279
title which kind of strikes a lot of

413
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,160
people is negative it's very normal and

414
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
very typical and with that you have a

415
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
visual that really matches that

416
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,639
people can have a level of storming

417
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,199
or frustration and it's often based on

418
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,440
differences opinions keep in mind the

419
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
project is very early on

420
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,399
and dr tuchman and other researchers

421
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
there's no time

422
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,279
requirement for the respective phases

423
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,240
in some mature highly functioning

424
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,560
teams particularly where it's the same

425
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,760
people or mostly the same people working

426
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,079
again and again together they can get

427
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,399
through storming so quickly that it's a

428
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
blip and it almost or it's almost not a

429
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
blip i should say it almost seems like

430
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
from an outsider point of view that

431
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,440
there's really almost no storming at all

432
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,839
however

433
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
been alerted to the point uh from some

434
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
prior presentations of earlier versions

435
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
of this talk that sometimes based on the

436
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
description which i'm about to delve

437
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,279
into

438
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,519
that it's entirely possible for the team

439
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
to be in storming for the almost the

440
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
entire life of the project and that's

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
certainly not the goal right nobody

442
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
would consciously want to be in the

443
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
stormy face but the literature is clear

444
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
about storming occurring typically after

445
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,600
forming and here's what happens there

446
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
can be resistance and a lack of

447
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
participation based on differences of

448
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
opinions

449
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
regardless of job titles regardless of

450
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
job titles there can be sort of

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
jockeying for position

452
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
in terms of contribution

453
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
and perhaps it's not a conscious but

454
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,160
it's people trying to figure out how

455
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
they're going to make the contribution

456
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
within this

457
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
this endeavor this project

458
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,880
this sprinter iteration whatever it's

459
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,519
called compared with other phases

460
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,959
emotions are relatively high

461
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,759
this

462
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
phase in general tends to be a sort of a

463
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
higher amplitude

464
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,399
and duration

465
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
when you have a team working on

466
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,440
something

467
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
that they've never worked on before

468
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
and or

469
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,759
team members that have never worked

470
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,000
together before or sort of a combination

471
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,040
of those

472
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
that's sort of what the literature

473
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
hints at in terms of what's typically

474
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,199
seen but the good news is regardless of

475
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,199
your particular situation here's what

476
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,400
you can do

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,119
so somebody again that person

478
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,919
a

479
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,720
cyber security manager lead a project

480
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
manager a scrum master whoever that

481
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
person is requesting and encouraging

482
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,240
feedback

483
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
here's what's meant by that specifically

484
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
though

485
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,679
because who wouldn't i mean that seems

486
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,520
like a good idea for all projects and

487
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840
all phases here's what's meant by that

488
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
whether it's uh in person or it's

489
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
virtual so the particulars will vary

490
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,440
based on those sort of situations

491
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
somebody is is saying you know

492
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
if you come across any questions or

493
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,840
concerns including small ones please let

494
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
me know and then maybe give two or three

495
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,039
ways that they can uh with as low as

496
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,360
lowest level of friction as possible can

497
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,679
make this can surface a concern or a

498
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,400
question you know email me or chat or

499
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
hop on a zoom call or pop in my office

500
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,000
or you know give several ways

501
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,960
and it's not a one-time invitation it's

502
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
a recurring invitation for feedback the

503
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
point here is according to the

504
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,559
literature and my own experience is that

505
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,880
you know often the larger issues and

506
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
problems impediments whatever they're

507
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,440
called

508
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
are sort of self-revealing and everybody

509
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
knows about them rather quickly

510
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,120
sometimes it's the smaller

511
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,000
issues that especially in aggregate can

512
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
be a bit of a drag in terms of the

513
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,240
performance and happiness of the team

514
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
and so by requesting encouraging

515
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,360
feedback

516
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
on a continuous basis

517
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
and having the right tone

518
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
right in terms of your invitation for

519
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,360
feedback and responding with

520
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,160
appreciation you're able to identify

521
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
these issues that otherwise wouldn't

522
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
come out or might possibly come out at

523
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
the very end of the project when you do

524
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
a review

525
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,679
so very very important and please keep

526
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
that in mind according to the literature

527
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
and i want to jump to the last bullet

528
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
point certainly there have been

529
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,559
lots of great talks and books

530
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,360
plenty about trust as it relates to this

531
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,039
conversation though

532
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,080
people are

533
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,559
extremely complicated projects are

534
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,120
extremely complex here's what can be

535
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,919
done however according to the literature

536
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,480
and my own experience

537
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
let's say you have an agile team you

538
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
don't have to but let's just say for

539
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
this example you have an agile team and

540
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
let's say it's scrum

541
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
and let's say that every

542
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,720
uh work day from 9 to 9 15 local time in

543
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
person or virtually

544
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,760
the team is going to get together and

545
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,039
you know typically it's you know what

546
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
did you do since the last meeting what

547
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
are you going to do in the new work day

548
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,799
and any issues or impediments

549
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
the the format of it isn't important

550
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
those are just what's typically asked in

551
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
most organizations and let's say you're

552
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
going to do that every workday now

553
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
listen things happen so maybe a meeting

554
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,320
gets canceled that's not what i'm about

555
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,520
to

556
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
address but let's say three of them get

557
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,320
cancelled in a row or four get cancelled

558
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,080
in a row especially at the beginning of

559
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,039
the project well not only are you not

560
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,760
honoring commitments you're eroding

561
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,559
trust and so anyways it's by honoring

562
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,440
commitments as simple as it might sound

563
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
you could goes a real long ways in terms

564
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
of building trust

565
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
and that brings us to the norming phase

566
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,280
as you see as you can see from the graph

567
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,320
above it's the second highest level of

568
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
performance in terms of productivity and

569
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,640
happiness for the team here a very

570
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,559
different visual not a hierarchy but

571
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,480
rather showing the interconnectivity

572
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
compared with forming and storming and

573
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,760
here compared with railroad phases the

574
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,080
goals and the purpose of the project are

575
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,400
much more well understood and with that

576
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
translates in most people a higher level

577
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,360
of confidence and improved engagement

578
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
and the second to the last bullet point

579
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
here

580
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
talks about

581
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
relief or lowered anxiety so if there is

582
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,159
anxiety during storming which is

583
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,799
perfectly normal according to dr tuchman

584
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,960
and others it is

585
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
lowered or eliminated

586
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
during the norming phase and then that

587
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,039
last bullet point really speaks more to

588
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,039
the visual and that would be the team is

589
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,120
starting to develop cohesion

590
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
um in terms of how they interact with

591
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
each other relative to the forming and

592
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
storming phases earlier

593
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,559
and here's what you can do to get the

594
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,720
team grow in advance which in this case

595
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,760
means move on to phase four

596
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
performing which is the highest level of

597
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
performance

598
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
you do a time check here

599
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
and that would be this

600
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,440
not waiting to the end of the project

601
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,240
but along the way recognizing both

602
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,840
individual and the collective team

603
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,919
efforts and accomplishments

604
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,240
if it's um something that can be done in

605
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,080
your organization

606
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,320
learning opportunities along the way

607
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
some organization this may not this may

608
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,600
or may not make sense uh it's typically

609
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,559
done

610
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
in agile organizations but not

611
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
exclusively and that is a little degree

612
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
of cross-training in terms of dev and qa

613
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
for example

614
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
being able to

615
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
step into the other roles and make a

616
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
contribution if necessary so there can

617
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,440
be a little bit of sort of

618
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
cross-training or cross-learning

619
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,400
um for the team

620
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
um to the extent that it makes sense

621
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
that's what that third

622
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,600
second bullet point speaks to here

623
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
compared with earlier faces the team is

624
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
in this in the second highest level

625
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
performance so that person the scrum

626
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,280
master project manager info security

627
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
lead whoever that person is sort of

628
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
pulling back and only getting involved

629
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
if and when necessary so at speaking to

630
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
the energy monitoring the energy of the

631
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,559
team very different from earlier on

632
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,799
and yet brings us to the highest level

633
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
of performance which by the way

634
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
correlates with happiness and that is

635
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,320
performing

636
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,919
and here are very different visuals

637
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,360
showing really the inner connectivity i

638
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,840
think it's the last bullet point here

639
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
yes demonstrations of interdependence

640
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
and self-management sometimes called

641
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,400
self-organization

642
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
um and somewhere in

643
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,240
some circles i should say so here you

644
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
have compared with your earlier phases

645
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
pretty high level of motivation trust

646
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
and empathy where if there's questions

647
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,440
or concerns that individuals on the team

648
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,240
typically will defer to the larger team

649
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,480
needs when questions come up

650
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
and certainly they're producing their

651
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
deliverables and the

652
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,480
performance is very consistent so this

653
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
is what's happening during performing so

654
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
just keep a mental picture of this

655
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,440
compared with forming storming and

656
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,600
norming and you can see this is the

657
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,919
highest level of performance but this is

658
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,880
an open active phase the project's not

659
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,840
done yet so this is really more about

660
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
these strategies here about keeping the

661
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
momentum going

662
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,440
on the team

663
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
here are some more to remarks i made

664
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,480
earlier minimal intervention

665
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,279
uh getting involved only when necessary

666
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,600
celebrating successes and here this last

667
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
bull point is the main thing that

668
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,039
separates

669
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,039
uh you know the norming from the

670
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
performing and that is where the team

671
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,760
is engaged in collective decision making

672
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,440
and problem solving

673
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
which is again reflected really by that

674
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
diagram also or the the visual the team

675
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,520
at left

676
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,320
and

677
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,520
here uh the leader is encouraging the

678
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
team to do so uh if they're not

679
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,440
and if they are to continue doing so so

680
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
that's what can be done here

681
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,360
and then that brings us to a journey

682
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
so a very different visual it's really

683
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
sort of the maybe the flip side of

684
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,840
forming it's a journey

685
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,320
and it is misunderstood

686
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,400
one of the top um

687
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
misunderstandings of a journey is that

688
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
the people never worked you know they go

689
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,799
away and they never work together again

690
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,159
for example in a agile scrum just

691
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,400
because you're at the end of the sprint

692
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,480
doesn't mean that your team won't work

693
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
together again so it doesn't force

694
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,559
people to stop working together it just

695
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,960
means that the combination of the people

696
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
and the scope

697
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,799
has been fulfilled so a journey that's

698
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,320
really what a journey meets more on that

699
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,279
here

700
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,559
so i do want to say up front that

701
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
we're not upfront this is almost the end

702
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,080
that dr tuckman introduced four phases

703
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
in 1965

704
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,159
forming stormy norming and performing

705
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,279
however

706
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,600
he and a colleague of his marianne

707
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
jensen found

708
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,480
that a journey was so important that dr

709
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,600
tuchman with the help of marianne jensen

710
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
updated his own model

711
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,440
in 1977 to include a journey

712
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
so

713
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,200
if you were to google for example some

714
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,799
of the keywords that have been discussed

715
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,360
here maybe dr tuckman or team

716
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,559
development and

717
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,279
similar uh phrases and terms

718
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,520
uh unfortunately about half of the

719
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
results will say there are four faces

720
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,960
it's not true

721
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
uh there are five because dr tuchman

722
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
updated his own model so if anyone says

723
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
there are four they're referring to

724
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,200
the 1965 model but in 1977 it was

725
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
updated so

726
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,799
geez it's been 45 years i think people

727
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,640
would be on board but maybe they need

728
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
another 45 to understand there are five

729
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,640
phases because there's a lot of

730
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,960
misunderstanding about that

731
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,080
um also it is called a journey

732
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
and because so many people call it

733
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
transitioning or mourning i want to call

734
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,120
that out that it's often called that but

735
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,159
it's not

736
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,559
it's a journey the reason

737
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,320
it's not transitioning or morning

738
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,600
because it may not it may or may not be

739
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,760
transitional morning so why call it that

740
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
here i'll jump to the morning example in

741
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
the interest of time picture uh it

742
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
doesn't have to be this scenario but

743
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
picture it's a big team

744
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,600
and it's a hundred people including info

745
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,120
security of course

746
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
uh i would say it's a big info security

747
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
endeavor actually

748
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,120
and it's 100 people cross-functional

749
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
people from legal and marketing and web

750
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,080
dev and everybody right and it was a

751
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
year-long project it was a phenomenal

752
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,039
success all the goals were achieved of

753
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,399
the project and now it's time for people

754
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,840
outside of info security to return to

755
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,720
their

756
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
regularly assigned responsibilities to

757
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,960
go back to legal to go back to marketing

758
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,360
and so on well

759
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,279
believe it or not the literature is very

760
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,720
clear on this some people can actually

761
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
experience uh

762
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,960
uh sort of a simultaneous conflicting

763
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
emotions of

764
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,360
um

765
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
satisfaction from the success of the

766
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
work the hard work and diligence of the

767
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,440
project

768
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
at the same time sadness that it's all

769
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
over

770
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,720
and because that's a possibility

771
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
uh it could be viewed as the morning

772
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
phase but it isn't necessarily so let's

773
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,399
just call it a journey because that's

774
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,480
what dr tuckman called it um here

775
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,000
i'm going to jump to in the interest of

776
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,279
time the

777
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,279
strategies to help the team grow really

778
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,640
this should be

779
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
um because i'm keeping the font large

780
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,279
right i if i had more room i would say

781
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,200
strategies to help the individuals on

782
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
the team

783
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,880
and the team and the company grow

784
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
because the project is done at this

785
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,159
point right

786
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,480
and that is firstly as

787
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,200
as it relates particularly to potential

788
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,000
sadness or potential mourning or just a

789
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,880
good practice recognizing change might

790
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
be quite obvious that everything is over

791
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,799
and people need to return to their uh

792
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,799
regularly assigned responsibilities if

793
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,559
that's the case

794
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,880
but just to call it out the project

795
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,039
manager the info security lead whoever

796
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,960
is that person an executive in the

797
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,159
organization

798
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,760
uh

799
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
relating that clearly

800
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,760
can go a real long ways ways in terms of

801
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,840
helping people understand that they made

802
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,760
a big contribution on this project and

803
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
now it's time to

804
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,520
go on to the next project or return to

805
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,360
the department or whatever the

806
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,600
whatever the situation calls for in your

807
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,039
organization for that unique uh project

808
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,399
uh here is an opportunity for

809
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
what some people call lessons learned

810
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,279
retrospectives post project reviews

811
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,360
postmortems it doesn't really matter

812
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,279
what the labels are the questions that

813
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
are often asked are well and well what

814
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,640
didn't go well what would we change you

815
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,559
can ask any question you'd like those

816
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,320
are the ones that are often asked and

817
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,600
the idea here is that

818
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,320
when you ask these questions you solicit

819
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,399
the feedback you are

820
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
likely to hear things that would not

821
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,960
come up on their own

822
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
particularly at the end of the project

823
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
and if the company is able to capture

824
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,279
these lessons learned and implement them

825
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,600
into the organization it has a

826
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,720
competitive advantage the next time it

827
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
does a project that's even partially

828
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,919
similar to this project next time around

829
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
so there's a big benefit for everyone to

830
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,520
do that

831
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,600
uh in here i want to jump to the last

832
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,679
bullet point celebrating the team's

833
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,679
accomplishments

834
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,679
the literature is very clear on this

835
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
this has a big impact

836
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
the part that surprised me

837
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,880
the most and it may or may not surprise

838
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,720
you is the following

839
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
certainly the individuals on the team

840
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
when the team as a whole

841
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,880
benefit from somebody whoever's the

842
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,320
right person in your organization it's

843
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,600
the ceo

844
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,240
it's the head of info security whoever

845
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
this person is is to

846
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
uh whether it's in person in a meeting

847
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
whether it's over an email whether it's

848
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,080
on a zoom call whatever the delivery

849
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,600
mechanism is

850
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,320
to

851
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
express appreciation for the hard work

852
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,440
diligence and contribution of the team

853
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
it goes a real long ways here's the part

854
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
though that surprised me that's very

855
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,840
clear in the literature and you have to

856
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,159
let me know later if this surprised you

857
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,720
and that's this the benefit to doing

858
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,039
that that is having a party or an

859
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,080
after-party right uh is

860
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,039
not just the individuals on the team

861
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,760
and the team as a whole it's also those

862
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,279
people who had nothing to do with the

863
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,640
project at all

864
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,519
but are in the company

865
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,399
and

866
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,720
the reason for that according to the

867
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,240
research is that it is reinforcing to

868
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,159
everyone including those who weren't

869
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
even involved in the project how the

870
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
company really appreciates

871
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,200
the hard work and diligence and

872
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,440
value that the team

873
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
teams of this type bring to the

874
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,880
organization

875
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,440
and so with that i'm going to move on in

876
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,039
the interest of time

877
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,559
and say that you know i gave examples of

878
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,960
typical questions that people asked at

879
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
the retrospective or the post-project

880
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
review at the end and you can ask

881
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,039
anything you'd like and it might even be

882
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,960
a good idea to experiment and try asking

883
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,799
different questions but i do want to

884
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,080
share with you

885
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,200
two

886
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,760
through experimentation and testing i

887
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,559
have found to be extremely powerful this

888
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,600
is for me not from the literature uh for

889
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
the last few years here's one question

890
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
for the team to ask and answer

891
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,080
how can we

892
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,519
the team

893
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,840
make an even bigger positive impact on

894
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
the company it's a very different

895
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
question than asking what went well what

896
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,559
didn't go well

897
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,760
and the answers might surprise you

898
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,679
uh big and small

899
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,279
in terms of sort of category of

900
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,559
responses

901
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,200
and

902
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,039
another one to consider

903
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,679
is for the team to ask and answer how

904
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,120
can we

905
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,320
the team

906
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,640
achieve even greater ease of work

907
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
and you'll be surprised likewise of the

908
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
kinds of answers to come back from

909
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,440
asking

910
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,880
this kind of a question

911
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,720
and so those are the highlights of the

912
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,399
five phases of team development i do

913
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,360
want to say uh that one of the frequent

914
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,799
questions i get so i'll just kind of

915
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,960
address it right now briefly is that the

916
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
direction is typically or almost always

917
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,519
i don't have an exact percent for you

918
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,080
because it varies by organization but as

919
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,159
we'll just say well it's a lot it's

920
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,799
going from left to right you know

921
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:20,559
foreign performing a journey here would

922
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,960
be an example where the direction might

923
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,200
go in the opposite direction depending

924
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,919
on the situation let's say the team

925
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,919
is been looking for a month and they're

926
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,399
clearly in the performing phase and two

927
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,159
people leave the team unexpectedly and

928
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,720
two people join the team

929
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
the team not that it's sort of a

930
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
conscious thing but in terms of how

931
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
they're behaving

932
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,039
right the characteristics they're

933
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
probably going to be back in the forming

934
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,000
phase this is the typical situation

935
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,799
where

936
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
uh the team is in one phase and then

937
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,320
they're moving in an opposite direction

938
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,640
but the good news is if they were

939
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,880
already in the performing phase

940
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,799
they it's even quicker to get back there

941
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,960
than the first time around

942
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,039
and you have the proven strategies for

943
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,480
for moving through the faces so that's

944
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,159
there

945
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,918
and so with that i want to move to a

946
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,159
quick wrap up here and say that forming

947
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,359
stormy norming performing and adjourning

948
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,679
are all according to dr tuckman and

949
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,480
other researchers necessary and

950
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,199
inevitable for teams to grow and deliver

951
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,119
results in this presentation

952
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,359
introduce the five phases and if you

953
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
were already familiar with i'm hoping

954
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,960
that maybe you still got some fresh

955
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,199
ideas and if you this was new to you i

956
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,960
hope it's a good overview

957
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,280
of the five phases of team development

958
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
where we cover the characteristics of

959
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,719
each phase

960
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,800
and then most importantly the strategies

961
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,359
for navigating uh the team from start to

962
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,440
finish through the different phases and

963
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
as promised i realize you can't see the

964
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,560
detail here there's a bibliography it

965
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,399
has 65 items

966
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,560
such as microsoft google and so on the

967
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,400
ones you saw in the visual

968
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
and also the main

969
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,040
speaking of visuals the main image that

970
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,480
we navigated i put together as a two

971
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,440
page

972
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,000
high resolution pdf

973
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,800
uh for you so if you're interested it's

974
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,960
available at

975
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,680
t dot up this is lowercase

976
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
should say that

977
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,079
b i t dot l y forward slash

978
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,839
v b c dash seven and if you want to scan

979
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,599
it there's the code

980
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,440
you do a time check here

981
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,560
okay

982
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,040
and um

983
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,119
because this url this link is also on

984
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,119
one or two subsequent slides i'm going

985
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,720
to move forward

986
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,320
onto the next slide here and say that

987
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,560
based on prior experience many questions

988
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,520
relate

989
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,240
directly or indirectly to the visual

990
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
so i'm going to see if this works for us

991
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,000
if it's possible

992
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,320
to have one of the moderators from the

993
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,240
conference if there's any comments or

994
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,320
questions if they're able to verbalize

995
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
them while i have the screen up that

996
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,800
would be ideal and if not i can go to

997
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,760
plan b

998
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,839
but are there any comments or questions

999
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,800
um that we have that we can um yeah

1000
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,720
right yeah we've we've got uh we've got

1001
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,320
one here uh so

1002
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,839
is it possible for different team

1003
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,680
members to be at different stages for

1004
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,359
example if you have a performing team

1005
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,760
but hire someone new who is trying to

1006
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
find their place on the team does that

1007
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
mean that the whole team drops back to

1008
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,560
storming or norming well it's so it's

1009
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,440
the

1010
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
thank you for that and all questions and

1011
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
i have to tell you first time i've heard

1012
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,640
that question but here's what the

1013
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,599
literature says and my own experience

1014
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,359
what we're talking about here is the

1015
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,960
overall

1016
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
uh assessment of the team for example

1017
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,760
let's just say you are in the performing

1018
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
phase well that doesn't mean that there

1019
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,640
aren't problems bumps on the road issues

1020
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,119
risks materialize into issues right in

1021
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,960
the team can get through them it's sort

1022
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,800
of like the pervasive overall phase

1023
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,680
and so it is possible to have somebody

1024
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,119
on the team have the team sort of

1025
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,400
overall

1026
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,960
be in the performing face but an example

1027
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,720
in the real world in my experience and

1028
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,640
from the literature that speaks to the

1029
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
question or the scenario my

1030
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
understanding of the question and the

1031
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,880
scenario is if somebody is joining the

1032
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
team

1033
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,440
while the team is already in flight

1034
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,839
let's say the team isn't performing

1035
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,000
this would be a typical example of the

1036
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,560
situation where maybe one person is

1037
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,720
exhibiting storming well what you can do

1038
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,520
is you can help that person you can

1039
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
really focus attention on them and help

1040
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,920
sort of onboard them for lack of a

1041
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,800
better term onto the project as as

1042
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,599
quickly as possible and help navigate

1043
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,720
them into

1044
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
the performing phase so the more people

1045
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
exhibiting the behavior the better but

1046
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,520
it is speaking to the overarching

1047
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,400
uh

1048
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,359
you know uh assessment of the team's

1049
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,520
performance and obviously people are

1050
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
unique and different so some people will

1051
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,000
exhibit it to a more or lesser degree

1052
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,440
but it's overall how is the team

1053
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,880
behaving

1054
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,640
any other questions or comments

1055
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
some people say that there are four

1056
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,320
phases of team development others say

1057
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880
there are five is it four or five

1058
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,920
thank you

1059
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,000
this is a peeve of mine and i shouldn't

1060
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,560
uh say it's a peace of mind but it is

1061
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
there are there are five it's forming

1062
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,920
stormy normally performing in the

1063
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,320
journey and the reason is dr tuckman

1064
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,520
with his colleague updated his own model

1065
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,720
in 1977 to add a journey

1066
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,079
and

1067
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,839
if people think there are four i don't

1068
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,280
blame them because there's so much

1069
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
content out there that says that but i

1070
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,560
take my

1071
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,119
responsibility seriously and by the way

1072
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,520
in the bibliography i've got you know

1073
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
the information that speaks to dr

1074
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
tuchman studies and many of the other

1075
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
studies so if you're curious for more

1076
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,040
information later

1077
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
this is why i put it together in a

1078
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,000
bibliography for you

1079
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,359
any other questions or comments

1080
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,320
we've got one more here

1081
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,960
are there any provable proven usable

1082
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,320
strategies which can be leveraged to

1083
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
advance the team's productivity

1084
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,839
happiness and success

1085
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,920
yeah well that's kind of a really sort

1086
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,800
of the abstract for this talk really and

1087
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,880
that was really the goal what i wanted

1088
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
to do among other things to make this

1089
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,760
talk unique because the model doctor

1090
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,920
technical research is not unique in the

1091
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,560
sense that it was published in 1965 when

1092
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,240
there have been

1093
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,599
tons of talks

1094
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,680
at all kinds of venues about his model

1095
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,200
but i take

1096
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,359
that what dr techman said very seriously

1097
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,040
in that for example there are five

1098
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,560
phases not four

1099
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,079
and i sifted through all of the studies

1100
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,079
the scientific papers and the like to

1101
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,359
extract just that from that question the

1102
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,320
provable usable strategies in plain

1103
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
language as much as possible that we can

1104
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
use rather than just say it's a small

1105
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,240
it's a great model and that's nice to

1106
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,880
know that people think that um or that

1107
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,640
it sort of validates that but it's more

1108
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
important uh to understand exactly how

1109
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,440
you can use the model uh for your

1110
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,920
benefit and the benefit of the team

1111
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
and with that because i'm keeping an eye

1112
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,200
on the time

1113
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,480
i'm going to

1114
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
move to this slide here

1115
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
and say that you know post project

1116
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,960
reviews or retrospectives aren't just

1117
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,520
for projects they're also for talks and

1118
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,200
one way that i

1119
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,440
improve this talk is to understand if

1120
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
it's working for you if it's resonating

1121
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,720
with you

1122
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,599
and

1123
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,359
along those lines i wanted to have

1124
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,280
something that's very seamless

1125
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,160
and easy so i have a google form

1126
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,240
and it asks your name your email is

1127
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,880
optional and what do you think

1128
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,760
and that's it and so it's at lowercase b

1129
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,520
i t dot l y

1130
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,839
forward slash y e s

1131
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,640
seven

1132
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,480
and there's the code that you can scan

1133
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,680
if you'd like

1134
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,520
and um

1135
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,240
if you uh are able to fill in the survey

1136
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,839
i want to thank you in advance for doing

1137
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:54,800
so

1138
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
i really appreciate your feedback it

1139
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,880
really helps tremendously

1140
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,280
and when you hit the submit button on

1141
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,599
the google form i have a very short

1142
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,319
thank you message with lots of links to

1143
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,400
my linkedin and my facebook and my

1144
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,599
twitter and my website and so on so

1145
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,599
sometimes people have questions after

1146
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
talks after conferences actually it's

1147
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,720
quite normal

1148
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,359
and so i welcome them so your question

1149
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,520
your feedback is not limited to this

1150
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,599
live presentation if you have a question

1151
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,240
or a comment later that's one of many

1152
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,720
ways which you can reach out to me also

1153
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,680
if you do download the two page high

1154
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,400
resolution pdf in the footer of it

1155
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,160
there's a link to my website in my

1156
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,400
twitter and so on so that's another way

1157
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,319
you can reach out to me afterwards if

1158
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,640
you'd like to do so

1159
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,319
and with that

1160
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,560
i hope they were able to leverage these

1161
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,599
proven strategies to help the teams and

1162
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,200
frankly your own

1163
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,599
happiness productivity

1164
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,319
and success

1165
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,800
thank you everyone

1166
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
thanks a lot scott

1167
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,520
and that wraps up uh

1168
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,160
i guess monday at b-sides so thanks

1169
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,079
everyone for attending we're gonna be

1170
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,240
killing the broadcast uh in a few

1171
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
seconds here and we'll see you all back

1172
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,640
again tomorrow

1173
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,920
you
