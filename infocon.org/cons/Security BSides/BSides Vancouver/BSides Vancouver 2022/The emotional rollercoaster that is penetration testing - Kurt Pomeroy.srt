ethical hacker with ion united and i've

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,599
been fortunate enough to be employed in

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,519
this cyber security industry for a

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
little over three and a half years now

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,960
not like i'm counting or anything but um

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,240
really happy that you guys are here

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
sorry i'm about five minutes late i was

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,519
actually logged into the wrong

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
uh meeting room so i had to reconnect

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
and log back in upload my slides but i

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,440
only a half hour it's not uh technical

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
in nature it's basically just my

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
observations uh working in the cyber

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,160
security and pen testing fields for the

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
last three plus years um so what we'll

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
do is i'll just do a really brief

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
introduction i only have 17 slides so we

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,480
should be fine if i take a minute or two

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
on each slide uh we could have a little

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,719
bit time left over for uh from q a

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,079
um but

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
let me hit the button here here we go so

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,079
so if you're looking to

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,439
add a member to your family i would

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,520
recommend going out to the

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
adoption shelters and there's lots of

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
lovely lovely dogs and cats that need a

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
good home so

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,079
uh quickly

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
there we go sorry third slide uh my

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,600
background so i graduated way back in 97

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
uh maybe some of you guys probably

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
weren't even born then so what i i was

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
interested in computers but didn't

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,799
really know what i wanted to do so i

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,439
enrolled in a three-year it program

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
and part of that uh

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,759
had a um about an eight-week 12-week

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,880
work term

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
so i was lucky enough to land in a

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,599
couple of uh private k-12 schools and

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
then i turned that into full-time

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,160
employment for the first seven or eight

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
years of my i.t career and of course

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,040
during the during the three-year it

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
program we touched on everything so

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
there was programming networking

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
security and windows nt

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
at the time um so that's where i kind of

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,720
got my start into security and once we

74
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
had our first linux course i was i was

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
hooked right away love the command line

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,879
and so i was a big linux fan and google

77
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,160
ever since

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519
so that's pretty much my background i've

79
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,239
been been in i.t for a long time uh and

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,280
you know three to three and a half years

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
ago i was thinking about switching from

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
it

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
all together and actually my first ever

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
b-sides presentation was two years ago

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
uh besides calgary and uh so my talk was

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
about how i transitioned from an i.t

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
generalist to cyber security so if you

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
want to google that and check it out i

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
can send you a link if you need it and

90
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
youtube has a really funny screenshot a

91
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,720
thumbnail of me i don't know looking

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,319
looking sideways or something just it's

93
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
hilarious so check it out all the

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
reasons why i don't really like

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
being on video and cameras and things

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,159
but that's it no worries you sometimes

97
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,360
you have to step inside your comfort

98
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
zone right

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,440
so

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,120
next slide so we're just going to talk

101
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
about

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
um and i'm going to talk about some of

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,680
the highs and lows that i've experienced

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
during pen testing and no one really

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
teaches you or explains that to you when

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760
you're in you know pentest school or

107
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,879
where you're studying for a cyber

108
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,400
security certification you want to be a

109
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
fantastic so they're just some of the

110
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
things that i

111
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
noticed and

112
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
and things that i get worked up about or

113
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,560
or

114
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
you know nervous about when i when i do

115
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
these pen testing engagements for

116
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
clients so unfortunately the slide

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
animations

118
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,159
were not supported so normally i would

119
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,760
have probably had the start and then the

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,439
end and things you know those little

121
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,799
areas would have been circled as we go

122
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
so you kind of just get the full screen

123
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,959
right away but so let's talk about uh

124
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
scoping calls right um you wouldn't

125
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
really think they would be stressful but

126
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
they are for me and uh nerve wracking i

127
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,959
guess sometimes so

128
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,319
you know even when when you start a

129
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,000
scope and calming started a pen test for

130
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
an organization uh you know you're

131
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
excited right you don't know what what

132
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,680
the organization does what they're all

133
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
about you don't know their security

134
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
posture security settings they have in

135
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
place so sometimes when they talk about

136
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,440
we have a new project and we have those

137
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
discussions with the customers and we

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
ask you always phishing in scope and

139
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,120
then they say no so you know boo bummer

140
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,080
um

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
that's always the first area so you know

142
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
you start off being really optimistic

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
right you start down here in the

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
optimism section and then you find out

145
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,840
well fishing isn't in scope and of

146
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
course fishing is one of the main ways

147
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
that attackers gain access externally so

148
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
now oh yeah

149
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
i kind of have anxiety thinking well if

150
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
that's not going to work well what other

151
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
options do we have right

152
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,919
so the next option is password spring

153
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,520
and and maybe their

154
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
password guessing is another

155
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
common way that attackers and security

156
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
professionals gain access to systems and

157
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,960
networks externally

158
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
um but of course you know sometimes

159
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
during those conversations they take our

160
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,199
recommendations from previous years

161
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
and they uh say well we've implemented a

162
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,759
12 or 15 character minimum password

163
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
policy so then you're like ugh that's

164
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
depressing because you know you you

165
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
really want to see

166
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
from an attacker perspective you want a

167
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
security assessment perspective you know

168
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
maybe it's nicer to see the default

169
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
password policy of seven or eight

170
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
characters so when you it's great that

171
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,240
the company

172
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
um accepts your recommendations from

173
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
previous years but then it sucks because

174
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
it makes password spring a lot harder

175
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,600
right it's hard to come up with 14 and

176
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,520
15 character passwords that users are

177
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
might most likely to choose

178
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
so that's disappointing then you're kind

179
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
of in that ah

180
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
that dreaded sort of denial phase uh you

181
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
know phishing's not in scope password

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
policy is very strong you know you're in

183
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
trouble right away right so so scoping

184
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
can be very uh stressful you know highs

185
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
and lows maybe there is phishing maybe

186
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,039
they have a weak password policy so you

187
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
have those ups and downs and then of

188
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
course the last thing that sometimes we

189
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,759
talk about is the testing window and

190
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
oftentimes

191
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
companies are okay with nine to five

192
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
monday to friday but sometimes they'll

193
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
mention you know to be safe it's best to

194
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
work after hours so that's very

195
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,919
disappointing and depressing

196
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
just because you know

197
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
i'm used to working monday to friday

198
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
night at five of course we'll work after

199
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
hours if need be

200
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,919
uh whatever the customer wants but it's

201
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,720
just uh it's a little depressing when

202
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
you think well now you have to work

203
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
after hours it kind of screws up here um

204
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
your sleep schedule

205
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
uh and your typical work you know monday

206
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
to friday type thing so those are some

207
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
of the areas in when when you do uh

208
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
scoping for customers those are some of

209
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
the areas where you can experience

210
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
some of those highs and lows right and

211
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
this is pretty much what the slide is

212
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
about so okay so you've had your scoping

213
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,520
you've been assigned your project and

214
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,039
now you want to start doing the

215
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,639
constants or the reconnaissance or the

216
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
information uh gathering phase so maybe

217
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,960
you'll check the dns records right

218
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,039
that's always an important area to check

219
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
and you see systems like uh you know

220
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,560
subdomains like web like

221
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,840
webmail.clive.com or mail.client.com or

222
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
remote.client.com so that can indicate

223
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
um

224
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
that there's probably an exchange server

225
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,560
so there's you they're usually juicy

226
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
targets because there's a lot of

227
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
opportunities for password guessing

228
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
bypassing multi-factor authentication

229
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
and of course there's some of those uh

230
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,000
really

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
critical remote uh code execution

232
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
vulnerabilities that that came out with

233
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
exchange last year like proxy logon and

234
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,160
such so really exciting to see you have

235
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
those dns entries and then of course the

236
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
downside is um that they don't resolve

237
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
or you know there's there's no ip behind

238
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
them right so mail and webmail uh and

239
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,919
that's a typo it shouldn't be admail

240
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
this would be it should be email but but

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
there's no ip address listing on the

242
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,960
other end so you start off in your

243
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
excitement right you're starting a new

244
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
pen test you're doing your information

245
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
gathering your recon and now it's like

246
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
crap you know the the dns settings

247
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
aren't what you wanted them to be

248
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,039
uh and another time

249
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,400
it was working on a pen test and the

250
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
company had been acquired by another

251
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
organization so now when you're doing

252
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,960
your reconnaissance you have two sets

253
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
of email addresses

254
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
user accounts usernames it's basically

255
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
double the work so that can be really

256
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
challenging also and

257
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
you know it's it's causes more work for

258
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
you uh but it can it can make me feel

259
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
sad or depressed or or anxious the

260
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
typical the typical uh

261
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,319
you know emotional rollercoaster phases

262
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
that i feel right during during these

263
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,919
security projects and of course the

264
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,360
other thing that can be a real bummer

265
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,039
sometimes is you find out who the

266
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
organization is and you realize that

267
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,799
like i mentioned before they do year

268
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
over year over year testing with us or

269
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,839
another company

270
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
only to find out that they they've

271
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
implemented a lot of your previous pen

272
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
test findings so that's just going to

273
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,839
make the job

274
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,279
that much harder

275
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
and that much difficult so again now now

276
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,399
i'm feeling

277
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,920
uh you know i don't really know how to

278
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
pronounce that word exactly properly i

279
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
think it's

280
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,839
uh

281
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,279
capitulation and so i had to look it up

282
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,640
but it means you know basically like you

283
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
want to give up right you're in the

284
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
depths of despair

285
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
so that's um often disappointing

286
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
when you're doing your information

287
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
gathering and you come across issues

288
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,839
like these so you know you're really

289
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,920
high really excited to start a new pen

290
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
test and then you're down in the dumps

291
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
again but you know there's the ebbs and

292
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
flows right

293
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
testing

294
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
so the next one here

295
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,200
is um

296
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
external testing so

297
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
you've done your scoping you've had your

298
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
scoping calls with the customer you

299
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
realize what's in what's out of scope uh

300
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
you've done your internal you're doing

301
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
your external information gathering and

302
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
reconnaissance now you actually want to

303
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
start testing so there's some areas here

304
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,519
that i noticed that that i kind of hit

305
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
that roller coaster right so the first

306
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
thing would be

307
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
the password policy that we talked about

308
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
that earlier uh maybe they've got a

309
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
really strong password policy or maybe

310
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,839
we talked about the length minimum

311
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,120
length requirement but maybe what about

312
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
the lock of the threshold so my way they

313
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
only allow you know three bad or three

314
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
failed password attempts in 30 minutes

315
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
so now you can really only do two

316
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
every every 25 minutes or every 28

317
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
minutes so maybe you can only do for an

318
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
hour

319
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
you know times

320
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,839
24 hours so you can only do 48 a day so

321
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
that can really slow you down i would

322
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
other times you may be on a pen test and

323
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
you could be really optimistic and you

324
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,839
start

325
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
and sometimes the customer says well we

326
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,640
have a 10 10 failed lockup policy uh 10

327
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
failed bad passwords in in 30 minutes so

328
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
then you can do eight or nine

329
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
uh let's say eight every every 30

330
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
minutes 16 an hour times 24 so you can

331
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
do a lot more that way so sometimes it's

332
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,839
depressing

333
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,440
when you find out oh you can we know

334
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,959
what's your password policy and we often

335
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
guess ask the customer for the password

336
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
policy because we don't want to

337
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
intentionally lock it at any accounts

338
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
right we don't want to impact any user

339
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
accounts or the organization

340
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
so that's depressing it gives me anxiety

341
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
um and then sometimes you'll get lucky

342
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
right you'll perform password guessing

343
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,800
password spraying so i'll just you know

344
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
password spraying is just trying one

345
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
password against all of the accounts uh

346
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
so that that's very effective sometimes

347
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
season in the year has been really

348
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,480
effective for us so you know uh spring

349
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
2022 might be a good password to try

350
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,079
winter 2021 summer 2021 summer 2022

351
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,480
those are often fruitful uh so sometimes

352
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,519
you'll guess the password you'll be

353
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,519
really excited or i'll be really excited

354
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
uh thinking yeah it's great now i can i

355
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
can gain access externally but then

356
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,120
maybe there's no

357
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
there's no citrix or maybe the vpn

358
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,040
requires multi-factor authentication or

359
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
there's no vmware horizon desktop or the

360
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,360
account that you access uh hasn't been

361
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
granted those privileges and that's

362
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
happened to me a few times where i'll

363
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
guess a credential i'll try to log in

364
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
and you log into citrix but you have

365
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
been those applications like remote

366
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
desktop or whatever haven't been

367
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,680
published to you so that's really

368
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,480
that's a real uh um hit

369
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
to your emotional state sometimes or for

370
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
me it is anyway

371
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
and of course the last the last option

372
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,640
is you know when you're doing these

373
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
coping calls maybe we find out if they

374
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
have mfa or maybe they don't tell us so

375
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
you capture a credential you're all

376
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,399
excited you guess the password uh you

377
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
try to log in and then you see that

378
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
prompt that says you know sending the uh

379
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,560
the code the to the user's mobile device

380
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,920
so that can be really tough and

381
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,120
sometimes you can think well maybe we

382
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
can bypass mfa

383
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
by sending them by capturing their

384
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,399
credentials and then logging in right

385
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,639
after them sending them that rogue

386
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,800
mfa push to their mobile device

387
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
but sometimes you you find out that the

388
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
only option available is for the user to

389
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
enter the code so the push notification

390
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
option might not even be available so

391
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
that's obviously really disappointing

392
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,320
depressing

393
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
so i'm kind of hanging out in the in the

394
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,519
lower area of the emotional

395
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,040
rollercoaster but so what i wanted to

396
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
talk a little bit about

397
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
some of the lows and then we'll talk a

398
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
little bit about some of the highs so

399
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
um the next oh here we go next slide so

400
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
password guessing right so i'm thinking

401
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
back you know three plus years now i'm

402
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
trying to remember the first time that i

403
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
achieved some of these sort of

404
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
uh

405
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
goals i guess when you're pin testing so

406
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
the first one was password attack so i

407
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
definitely remember my first time on a

408
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,320
project by myself performing password

409
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,639
spring externally

410
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,720
uh using i think i was using burp suite

411
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
actually a web application tester and i

412
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,399
was actually able to guess passwords it

413
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,560
was really exciting and i remember we

414
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
had to go out and maybe get groceries or

415
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,959
something and i didn't want to leave

416
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,560
because because i was actually you know

417
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
guessing that credential i was actually

418
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
about to break in externally so those

419
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
things are are really um high points for

420
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,200
me

421
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
and uh so you can see you know you start

422
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
off maybe with your um

423
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,920
i can't really see that slide what is

424
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
that you start off with your

425
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,519
um

426
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,000
excitement and optimism right and then

427
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
uh so then when you do guess the

428
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
password now you're on that high right

429
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
you've got that thrill you're thinking

430
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
yes you know i've got credentials

431
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
now i can move the pen testing

432
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
engagement forward a couple little

433
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,839
screenshots here this is just an

434
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
internal password spray using uh invoke

435
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
domain password spray which is a

436
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
powershell

437
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
script

438
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
and down here the size is probably

439
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,040
pretty small but this is hydra doing

440
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
external password spraying against

441
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
autodiscover against the uh on-prem

442
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,760
email server and you can see here spring

443
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
maybe spring 2019 uh was the actual

444
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,079
password i think i have it over here

445
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,320
in bigger size but uh so as you can see

446
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,079
it is really exciting for me and it

447
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,240
still is really exciting for me when i

448
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
actually guess a password uh just

449
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,519
because

450
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
uh you know it's exciting right you've

451
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
guessed a password that user has chosen

452
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
and in this particular screenshot the

453
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
user had chosen secure one two three

454
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
four five six so that's not really a

455
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
really secure password at all

456
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
uh the next slide so here here's a big

457
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
one for me and this is really exciting

458
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
it still is

459
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
um and so i might start off on an

460
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,959
internal pen test with anxiety or fear

461
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,160
or worry

462
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,519
because maybe in the scope and calls the

463
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,800
customer says you know they have some

464
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
really advanced

465
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,320
endpoint detection response software

466
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
like palo alto cortex xdr for example

467
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
tough tough av

468
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,399
vendor to bypass although all of them

469
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
have their weaknesses so when you

470
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
actually

471
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,680
uh and i definitely remember the first

472
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
time i bypassed windows defender because

473
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,519
all those tools stopped you from doing

474
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,880
the job right they stopped you from

475
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
loading powershell scripts in the memory

476
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,560
they stop you from dropping executables

477
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,320
or executing your malware trying to get

478
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
command and control established so av

479
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
we're always battling with av all the

480
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,920
time never stops and then it always

481
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
changes what might work today

482
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
won't work tomorrow right and vice versa

483
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
so the very first time you know i

484
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,839
started off with with anxiety trying to

485
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
battle with palo alto cortex the slides

486
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
are probably small i don't think i can

487
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
make them any bigger here um but the

488
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,560
screenshot is the palo alto cortex xtr

489
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
running and then that's my interpreter

490
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,519
session one open which if you're a pen

491
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
tester you know that's usually a really

492
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
good sign and time to do your happy

493
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
dance but that's me bypassing uh windows

494
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,199
defender

495
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,040
a cortex story

496
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
and then establishing using that

497
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,759
interpreter

498
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,839
command and control for for remote

499
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
access and post exploitation activities

500
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,440
right

501
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,279
so that was a really exciting one for me

502
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,839
so then you feel that that relief right

503
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,360
it's like okay

504
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,279
now i bypassed av

505
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
now i can get my tools to run now i can

506
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,399
run tools like um

507
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,480
bloodhound for example to do session

508
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
enumeration and to find you know

509
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
vulnerabilities with an active directory

510
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,519
maybe you have other reconnaissance

511
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,800
scripts that you want to run there's

512
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,399
some

513
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,240
there's a powershell script what's it

514
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
called something recon adrecon.ps1

515
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
that's a nice one gather up information

516
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
on users and groups and permissions and

517
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,160
privileges

518
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,720
uh i i got a question here from janna

519
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
sorry are you uploading slides or

520
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
sharing your screen i think i'm sharing

521
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,440
my screen and i did upload my slides i

522
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
can give you guys a link if you want the

523
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,079
the slideshow a slide deck afterwards

524
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,000
like i said there's only 17 or 18 slides

525
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,399
in it not a whole lot but if you want

526
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
the slides just reach out or maybe

527
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
there'll be a link or something but i'll

528
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
send those along if somebody needs them

529
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,519
so

530
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,600
that's really exciting just just to

531
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
bypass av and it still is to this day so

532
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
i always get a rush my heart starts to

533
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,399
beat and start to get a little sweaty

534
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,000
but that's it you know i enjoy my job

535
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,560
and sometimes um you know those are the

536
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,920
those are the highs and lows that i that

537
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,199
i like so i want to share those with you

538
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,040
guys especially for new people too when

539
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
they're just getting into any industry

540
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
and maybe it's maybe it's weird maybe

541
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,280
i'm i'm not i'm not the norm uh or you

542
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
know maybe it's

543
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
as people do this for a long time maybe

544
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
it's not as exciting but it is still

545
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
really exciting for me

546
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,720
a big one for me

547
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,039
also was was fishing right so we we had

548
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
a fishing system that i kind of overall

549
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,559
overhauled made it better and then the

550
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
first time when you run your fishing

551
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,319
campaign you know i'm always really like

552
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,959
nervous and it's it starts with anxiety

553
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,480
as usual

554
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,280
uh and um so you run that fishing

555
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
campaign you know you want to double

556
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,200
check and make sure you've got your

557
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,280
spelling correct i did launch efficient

558
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,440
campaign before where i spelled the

559
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
person's name that i was impersonating

560
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
wrong uh and then i had to kind of

561
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
quickly send the second email with the

562
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,320
corrective name and it worked out but it

563
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,520
was still still a big mistake so uh you

564
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
know launching that campaign is always

565
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,360
exciting and watching the information

566
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
like how many emails were sent watching

567
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
those numbers go up like emails opened

568
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
emails clicks and then it's really

569
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
really exciting when you see uh

570
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
submitted data

571
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,679
oftentimes we'll quickly log in grab

572
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,200
those credentials and then try to log in

573
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
right after the user and bypass

574
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
multi-factor authentication send them

575
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,160
that mfa push to their mobile device

576
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,919
that we talked about before

577
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,280
so you know you start with anxiety but

578
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,640
then it's really thrilling right when

579
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,840
you actually capture those

580
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,360
credentials um the next one so this was

581
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
probably the most exciting still is

582
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
always will be is when you achieve

583
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
domain admin right it's not always the

584
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,760
goal of a pen test uh to

585
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
to achieve that don't wait admin access

586
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
but uh usually when you do you know you

587
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
do that domain admin happy dance and

588
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,799
i've done that a few times thanks

589
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,480
thankfully no one's i've been around to

590
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
see it but it is really really exciting

591
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
it's probably one of one of the uh most

592
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
exciting things about pen testing is is

593
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,960
reaching that domain admin level knowing

594
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
that you've you know you've bypassed the

595
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
security you've found holes in the

596
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,280
environment

597
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
um and now you have essentially have the

598
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
uh keys to the kingdom

599
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,280
so

600
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
and a lot of times i'll start down here

601
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
in this really really bad state just

602
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,039
just because

603
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
maybe the external pen test didn't go

604
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,799
well right maybe phishing the the email

605
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,320
was sent to the spam folder maybe we

606
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,440
didn't capture any credentials maybe

607
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
nobody clicked on a link so that

608
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
sometimes you start in a bad place and

609
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
now you're on the internal network and

610
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,400
you're thinking oh now i've got a battle

611
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
with av

612
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
and i have to do all this enumeration

613
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
and i have to try to find

614
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
vulnerabilities and escalate privileges

615
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,400
and you only have a certain amount of

616
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
time typically a week or so maybe less

617
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
to do this so you know and then you have

618
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,039
to battle with av on top right

619
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,320
so um that can be really uh really low

620
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,640
point uh sometimes but oftentimes maybe

621
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
maybe within the first hour to you you

622
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
achieve domain in mid-level access and

623
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
then you're on top of the world right

624
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
you feel you feel great

625
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
so that's really and this screenshot

626
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
just shows that i created a user account

627
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
called ion and i added it to the domain

628
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,360
admins group and then i grabbed a

629
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
screenshot from my

630
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
my trophy for my history um so that's

631
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
you know really really low really high

632
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,720
like that euphoria feeling that that's

633
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
it's not a lie for me i it really feels

634
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
like you're on top of the world and

635
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
sometimes especially early on there's

636
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
trouble getting to sleep at night

637
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
because you're so excited about wanting

638
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
to want to continue and log in the next

639
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,559
day

640
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
and keep testing right

641
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,600
so another one which is really exciting

642
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
for me and it still is like we talked

643
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
about oh sorry um

644
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
we talked about the highs let me go back

645
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
one so that would be um

646
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,559
here we go so now we'll talk about some

647
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,240
of the lows right we talked about

648
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
getting domain and men we talked about

649
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
uh bypassing av but now we'll talk about

650
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
some of the areas that can really bring

651
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
you down sorry two screens open here

652
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320
here we go

653
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
and i'm trying to hurry just because i

654
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,919
was about five minutes late so maybe

655
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,679
we'll go to about 2 35 so about 10

656
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,440
minutes if everybody anybody has to drop

657
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
off in five minutes totally understand

658
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
uh so we'll talk about some of the lows

659
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
right we talked about the highs uh so

660
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
password spring

661
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,360
definitely sometimes you start off

662
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
you're very hopeful right

663
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,559
you're thinking okay new project

664
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,880
external pen test here we go and then

665
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
you try passwords of all different makes

666
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
models and varieties season and year

667
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
company names days of the week you know

668
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
weak passwords like password one two

669
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
three and and

670
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,480
you know you substitute certain

671
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,760
characters you try all these different

672
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,840
things passport spring just doesn't work

673
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,799
so that can be very disappointing um and

674
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,320
often and sometimes it has happened

675
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
occasionally not very often maybe once

676
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
or twice um that i've

677
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
uh read a password spray and i've

678
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,360
actually locked into account so now you

679
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
feel really bad because you're you've

680
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,799
impacted the customer and and their

681
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,799
environment right so

682
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,840
then you can feel uh really crappy

683
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
and so i do have a question from janice

684
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,960
so i'll i'll answer those janice in a

685
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,880
couple of minutes i'll just get through

686
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,000
these last few slides i've only got

687
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
three or four more and then i'll get to

688
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,000
any q a if you guys have any so this

689
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
this is a really can be a real soul

690
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
crushing low for me when you you try

691
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
password spraying and it doesn't work

692
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,520
and you try for days and days and days

693
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
and it doesn't work so often times then

694
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
we'll just typically uh move to the next

695
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,799
phase of pentest which is internal and

696
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,559
we'll note in the report that uh you

697
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,400
know exterior defenses like password

698
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
policies mfa uh blocked us from gaining

699
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
access externally because you want to

700
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,679
talk about the good things in a pen test

701
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,280
report as well as the areas of

702
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,480
improvement

703
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
so the next one here uh this soul

704
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
crushing low i call it is application

705
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
white listing so sometimes you get in a

706
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
higher security environment

707
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
where they've the organization has

708
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,559
implemented application whitelisting so

709
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
i'm on a pen test right now actually

710
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,400
where i have no access to powershell so

711
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
that can be challenging because

712
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
powershell has been built in the windows

713
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
and there's so many attack tools and

714
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,120
techniques built around powershell so

715
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,520
that was really depressing whoops uh

716
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
when you bypass when you log in and you

717
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
realize not only does can you not access

718
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,360
like an older version of powershell but

719
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
you can't access powershell at all there

720
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
are bypasses i tried different things

721
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
but they didn't work so again you start

722
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
hopeful and now you're you know this one

723
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,039
here

724
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,520
uh this the c drive has been restricted

725
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
so that's group policy and also down

726
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,799
here this application has been blocked

727
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,240
by our administrator so those are group

728
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,280
policy settings so now you're really in

729
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
the dumps right i mean what are you

730
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,240
going to do you have you have the

731
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
command shell sometimes you don't even

732
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
have the cmd.exe command shell so now

733
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
you're really up freaking you have to

734
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,919
really think

735
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,000
other ways of um

736
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
living off the land and gathering the

737
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
information that you need

738
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
but i mean we rely on powershell a lot

739
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
as the bad guys do so when powershell's

740
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,919
blocked it really it really um

741
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,440
makes for a bad day

742
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,559
uh and here's another one this very dif

743
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,880
disappointing i should say difficult

744
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,080
um

745
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
which is av and edr right we talked

746
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
about bypassing it but then we talked

747
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,640
about what happens if it doesn't work

748
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
and i'll use palo alto cortex because

749
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,720
it's really strong um

750
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,200
really really strong 80 edr products so

751
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,520
every every type of memory corruption or

752
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
dll or anything you try to incorporate

753
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,679
into the environment doesn't work

754
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,760
so that can be really tough uh

755
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,080
especially and and sometimes uh you

756
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,440
you'll get your shell code in memory

757
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,559
right you'll have some command and

758
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
control maybe some interpreter or

759
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
something like that metasploit you get

760
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
that shell code in your memory you

761
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
finally get it to execute and it

762
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,760
bypasses edr but then the av right maybe

763
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,279
there's a palo alto firewall or some

764
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,600
other next-gen firewall that detects

765
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
that command and control communication

766
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,200
and cuts you off right so you work

767
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
really hard you get your av and you

768
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,039
bypass av get your malware running and

769
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,159
then all of a sudden it's blocked up a

770
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
network layer so again really high

771
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,080
really low right

772
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,440
but that's it that's that's part of the

773
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,559
job

774
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,240
and one other area

775
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,200
um

776
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
yeah i'll get to that one may also uh

777
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,039
the last

778
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,000
last two slides one slide two slides um

779
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
sorry i do realize we're going over here

780
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
by five minutes but i'll keep it short

781
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
uh so presentations right um not really

782
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,360
comfortable

783
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,200
uh we can move q a to the session for

784
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,679
track one after the top okay uh so i'll

785
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,120
finish off these last slides and then we

786
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
can do some some q a

787
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,279
uh so for me report presentations being

788
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,799
online doing this right now is very

789
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,720
stressful um

790
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
it keeps me up at night makes me worry

791
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,320
i'm not comfortable on camera you know i

792
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,799
never have i probably never will um so

793
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,720
presenting right when you when you

794
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
work if you want to study to be a pen

795
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
tester that there's not a whole lot

796
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,919
talked about actually presenting your

797
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,840
findings to clients and that's really

798
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
really important because you're you know

799
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,320
your pen test report is your leave

800
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,480
behind your executive summary uh is

801
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,679
really really important because that's

802
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,520
probably all that the ceos the

803
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,000
executives are going to read so being

804
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,840
comfortable presenting

805
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
is really important and it was something

806
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
that you know i started at the beginning

807
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
of 2019 and covet happened a year later

808
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
and my job was work from remote anyway

809
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,279
but i was in front of clients

810
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,640
quite a bit and now i haven't really

811
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
been for a few years so it's just a

812
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
little harder to present because it's

813
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,400
tougher to kind of read the room uh when

814
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,080
you're doing things virtually so that's

815
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
a big area of stress for me and

816
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,120
especially when you're doing things over

817
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
teams or zoom or or webex and i know i

818
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
worry about making mistakes or not

819
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
telling a convincing story not not

820
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
driving change or demonstrating the

821
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,840
risks adequately

822
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,840
to the customer right so that one is i

823
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
definitely start on the anxiety level

824
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
i'm definitely not over here sometimes

825
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
it's optimistic if the pen test went

826
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,919
really well

827
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,520
i could be really optimistic and excited

828
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,799
to present the findings but a lot of

829
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,480
times it's usually a bunch of anxiety

830
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
and not so much they'll make for an hour

831
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
uh but then when you're done you get

832
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,279
that relief right so you're really high

833
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,360
really low um so it's it's nice to have

834
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,279
that relief when when the fan test uh

835
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,960
presentation is over you can kind of

836
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
relax uh so i do have just have a couple

837
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
more slides at the end and i did mention

838
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,159
in my preview i guess is how you can win

839
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,840
against these apex defenders how many

840
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,919
these really strong next generation

841
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,279
customers who have implemented all your

842
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
recommendations you know they have

843
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,640
advanced edr software they have

844
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
monitoring and learning they have a sim

845
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,400
uh they have you know web application

846
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
proxies and firewalls when they when

847
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,440
you're up against all of these

848
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
different

849
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
um compensating controls there are still

850
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
possibilities away and i kind of

851
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
kind of feel like i kind of stuck these

852
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,720
slides in at the end here a little bit

853
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,799
but i just wanted to give you uh just a

854
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,039
couple of of ideas and most of the time

855
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,799
for me personally when when you're

856
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,240
trying to

857
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
to uh to win

858
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,640
you're trying to bypass endpoints and av

859
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
and edr software so i just put a couple

860
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,200
of tips in here about how to do that

861
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
because if you can bypass av and edr you

862
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,679
can run the software you want to run and

863
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
then you can assess the way you want to

864
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,640
assess

865
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,039
and you can stay away from the antivirus

866
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,840
software so that's a a big one for me

867
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,919
right it's all it always comes down to

868
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,880
bypassing av and edr so

869
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
a couple of tips so the the general

870
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,200
theory that seems to work well lately is

871
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
you need to create some shell code and

872
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,400
you can use like msn venom or some other

873
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
shell code creator for that you want to

874
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,559
get that shell code into memory you want

875
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,559
to decrypt it because av

876
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,080
will will see it every time just

877
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
off-the-shelf you know interpreter uh

878
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
shellcode or something like that will

879
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,840
just get flagged every time so you want

880
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
to encrypt and decrypt at runtime and

881
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,200
you can do this in any language you can

882
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,760
use it in c or c plus plus python column

883
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,919
doesn't really matter

884
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,600
also if you use metasploit and

885
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,679
interpreter like i do a lot i don't use

886
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,679
the second stage payload so there's a

887
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,840
first stage in the second stage so when

888
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
you use second stage payloads there's an

889
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,039
initial communication and then a

890
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,799
follow-on connection to

891
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
to run the rest of the the payload so

892
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
that that second stage connection that

893
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
calling out to the network shortly after

894
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
you execute a binary that that always

895
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,039
gets caught so just use a single stage

896
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,880
and make sure you're using valid tls

897
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,559
certificates and you're using the state

898
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,000
like the staging coding options like

899
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,840
chicago ni or zutukiro or xor

900
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
decryptor there's xor one i can't

901
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,279
remember the exact name so make sure

902
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
you're always encoding your uh your

903
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,039
stages and of course you

904
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,159
when you want to communicate when you

905
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,520
want to establish that command and

906
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
control of

907
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,320
communication from your endpoint to your

908
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,480
server back in aws for example do it

909
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,279
over https port 443 as that's always

910
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,960
allowed outbound you also have good

911
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
success sometimes doing it over dns but

912
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,360
that can get if if the the customer is

913
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
looking that sticks out like the sore

914
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
throne sore thumb sorry and you also if

915
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,039
you're going to drop an executable to

916
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,720
the disc not really recommended but

917
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
sometimes still works make sure you sign

918
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,279
your executable uh and you populate the

919
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
resources section so that usually just

920
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,120
gives information on uh like if you

921
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,240
right click on the binary choose

922
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
properties you can see the resources and

923
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,360
it just gives more information about the

924
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
executable so make sure you populate

925
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,039
that make sure you obfuscate your source

926
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,520
code also and there's a couple more tips

927
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,240
in here uh so i always like to try to

928
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,679
use a command and control software

929
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,600
that's got some socks proxying built in

930
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,520
so the metasploit interpreter you can

931
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,399
use posh c2 cobalt strike that's another

932
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,279
good one uh and if you can use that

933
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,840
proxy support you can

934
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,919
stay off the endpoint so you basically

935
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,679
you tunnel your connections through your

936
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,240
compromised server onto other internal

937
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,679
networks so you attack that way and you

938
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,240
don't drop any tools on the device

939
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
you're given the compromised desktop or

940
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
workstation uh use and leverage content

941
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
delivery networks like cloudflare uh

942
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,919
cloudfront is an option

943
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,360
that way it makes it really difficult

944
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
for the blue team to detect the

945
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,440
communicable traffic and to block it and

946
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,399
again research common by that but pi bas

947
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,200
bypass methods uh sometimes you might if

948
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
you have administrative privileges you

949
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
might be able to uninstall though it

950
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,840
doesn't work very often or stop the

951
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,440
service although that doesn't really

952
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,799
work that often

953
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,120
lately either maybe you can crash it or

954
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,720
maybe there's a known bypass so stay up

955
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,679
to date with uh common bypasses for

956
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,279
these products and maybe maybe download

957
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,960
a trial version put it on a vm and

958
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,880
practice that way and there are tools

959
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,399
like defender check

960
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,120
which will actually check your binary

961
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,559
and see if it's malicious and you can

962
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,399
also upload to virustotal but i don't

963
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,720
really recommend that because um the end

964
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
of virustotal where share will share

965
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,760
your malware with the developers so i've

966
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
got one slide left this is just

967
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,520
dedication to my dad uh he passed away

968
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,919
in september 2021 but he was really

969
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,159
happy and proud to know that i

970
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,960
um was accepted for my first b-sides

971
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,640
circumference security conference in

972
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,919
2020 so just just a shout out to my dad

973
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,039
i'm sure he's up there watching

974
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,600
somewhere and cheering me on so

975
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,880
just want to say

976
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
say hi to him so that's pretty pretty

977
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,320
much it for now i know i kind of went

978
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,960
through the slides a little bit quickly

979
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
uh just because i started

980
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,799
five minutes late but you know that's it

981
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,960
it's there's it's the highs and lows you

982
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,679
know of of pen testing uh lots of highs

983
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,840
lots of lows and

984
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,360
you know some some days are better than

985
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
others but don't give up and stick with

986
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,640
it and some days sometimes i've had days

987
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,880
where i felt like um i can't do this or

988
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
i'm not going to be able to do it and

989
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,399
then sometimes you will you will find

990
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,120
something uh you'll find a hole or an

991
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,080
exploit or a misconfiguration and then

992
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
the whole outlook changes right maybe

993
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,159
you've found i found domain admin

994
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,240
credentials in powershell scripts so you

995
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
go from not really having any

996
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,760
credentials uh to having domain admin so

997
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,279
don't give up because it can literally

998
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,000
change on a dime but it is uh

999
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
you know it is it is an emotional

1000
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,840
rollercoaster before and i said that to

1001
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
a few of my co-weaker co-workers so i

1002
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
figured it might be good uh

1003
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,840
a good option for a talk so that's

1004
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
pretty much it just just a half hour uh

1005
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,399
i'm not sure

1006
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,760
how i would

1007
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
this uh i think darren mentioned that we

1008
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,279
can move q a

1009
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,880
uh to the session track one after the

1010
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,159
talk so i don't know if i need to do

1011
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,120
anything or maybe i can just answer the

1012
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,000
questions there but um

1013
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,720
any ideas actually on um do i need to do

1014
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,640
anything else or am i finished so we've

1015
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
gone over a little bit

1016
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
so what i'd like to suggest is that we

1017
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
um you can pop into the q a uh in the

1018
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,080
main stage there and hit reply and reply

1019
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,519
to any questions that pertain to you and

1020
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,440
