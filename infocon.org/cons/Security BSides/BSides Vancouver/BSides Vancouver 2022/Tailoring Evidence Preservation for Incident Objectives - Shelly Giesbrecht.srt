1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,360
want to say thank you to besides

vancouver for allowing me to uh to speak

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
again um i really appreciate it i love

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,200
talking about stuff like this and

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,080
this is something that i've been

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,840
thinking about a lot this talk is really

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,000
important to me from perspective of what

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,480
i do as an incident responder

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
so really excited to be to be presenting

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
this for the first time at besides

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
vancouver for this year

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
a little bit about me for those of you

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
who have not met me my name is shelly

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
giesbrecht i am an incident responder at

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,840
crowdstrike specifically i am the

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
practice lead for canada so i i run the

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,559
canadian team as well as doing some of

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,879
our other global projects

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,520
and i've been doing this for a while um

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,320
i

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
started out

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,920
doing help desk many many years ago

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
learning how to support folks at that

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,879
level um and i love lego and that's

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,879
important because i think

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
that from the perspective of incident

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,079
response

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,120
lego

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
shows us how to build things and put

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,319
pretty things together with a manual

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
incident response is like if somebody

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,280
has

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
taken all those pieces

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
broken them in

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
and says build it again

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
but do it without the manual

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,680
so we help businesses put their lego

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
back together if you will um and

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
sometimes we have a couple pieces left

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
over but that i think is is my best job

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
and and i love talking to clients that's

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,439
what i do that's one of the reasons that

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,840
uh that i work in as a response because

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,920
i like to be customer facing and help

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,479
folks at their worst business days um as

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
you can tell i love a bow tie and i'm a

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,079
proud dog mama which hopefully we'll

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
bring in a little bit later

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
today is about talking about our worst

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,799
nightmare in incident response so for

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
your organization what your worst

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680
nightmare is um and the reason this talk

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
is really important to me is because i

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
talk to a lot of clients every year

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
i talk to you know several hundred

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
clients about the things that are going

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
on in their environment hopefully from a

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
from a proactive side but a lot of times

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,759
it's that after the incident we go in

60
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,598
and we help we try to figure out what's

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,520
gone on

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
and all sorts of industries big and

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
small companies

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,920
but one of the most disappointing

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
aspects of my work is not being able to

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
meet customer objectives in their

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
investigation

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
and that

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
largely is in part due to missing

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,680
evidence things that they just don't

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
have and there's a few different reasons

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
for why that might happen um when we're

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,720
dealing with ransomware for instance

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
that can be because

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,720
the stuff has you know been damaged or

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
perhaps

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
it's been overwritten

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
and or taken

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
deleted by the threat actor all those

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
things happen absolutely

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
um

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
but the really the biggest reason why we

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
can't meet customer objectives generally

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,599
speaking when we're talking about

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,879
missing evidence is because it doesn't

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
exist they don't have it they don't

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,280
collect it um and and that can be a real

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
a real problem when we're trying to meet

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
those objectives

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,000
so today we're gonna talk about you know

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
what's the worst nightmare what does

92
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
that look like um and then we're gonna

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,400
say you know starting from the bottom

94
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
and that doesn't mean um you know we're

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,879
gonna you know i took it from from the

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,480
drake song so there we go but what it

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,239
really means is is we might find

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
ourselves in an incident

99
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,319
and what i'm suggesting is we start

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
there and we move backwards and figure

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,480
out what we needed um and that was

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
really based on what sort of

103
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,400
organization that you are um and and

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
that so um

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,959
the thing you're going to hear a lot

106
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,360
today is it depends because in in

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,959
response to digital forensics that's our

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,560
general answer to most questions is when

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
we get asked it depends

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
uh and last but not least um we're going

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
to talk a little bit about finding your

112
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
allies how do you once you figure out

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
what you need how do you how do you get

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
those things and where do you find those

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,799
allies to help you do that and talk

116
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,760
about that a little bit briefly

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,840
all

118
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,560
right

119
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
how do we begin

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
let's say it's friday might be four

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
o'clock

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,439
dfir friday as we like to call it

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,879
you've been breached

124
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,680
you've had data stolen perhaps

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
and you don't know what was taken maybe

126
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,279
you've got a ransom note that said we're

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
going to publish your data in three days

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,759
if you don't pay us or

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,720
you got a notification from

130
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
from a government agency from a police

131
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,639
law enforcement organization maybe

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
i've heard of uh oh by the way i saw

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
your data being advertised on such it's

134
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
such a dark web forum you might want to

135
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
do something about that

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
the other option is maybe you got

137
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
ransomed you're hard down your systems

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
are encrypted you don't know how to

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
recover

140
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,160
so those are those worst nightmare

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
scenarios and by the way the spider on

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
the agenda slide that's my worst

143
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,759
nightmare so i like to include those

144
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,759
spiders absolutely my worst nightmare um

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
but these situations we get into as as

146
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
organizations we need to understand what

147
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
your worst nightmare is and so that's

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
kind of what i want you to do as we're

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
going along today is think about

150
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
what for your organization would be

151
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
the worst incident that could happen

152
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,600
there are a lot of incidents that could

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
happen we can't prepare entirely for

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,160
every single one of them but if we pair

155
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
for the worst case scenario we may then

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
be able to be much more effective in

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
other scenarios as well

158
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
okay

159
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,080
so

160
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
the first thing that i'm going to ask as

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
an instant responder well there's a few

162
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,199
other questions i'm going to ask but one

163
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,560
of the first things i'm going to ask as

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,360
an instant responder when i come in is

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
do you have any logs

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
do you have anything that we can look at

167
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,320
um

168
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
do you have pcapp do you have netflow do

169
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
you have edr data do you have web blogs

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,039
what do you have that'll help us out to

171
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,360
help you answer the questions that you

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,400
need to answer

173
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,840
and there are some other real questions

174
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,280
obviously that we're going to ask and i

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
love this comic i'm going to come ask a

176
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
series of scary questions and when i'm

177
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,160
done let's see if you can guess why i'm

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
asking them all right

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,520
one of those big questions is what are

180
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
your objectives

181
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
um and that's a really big one and

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
that's something that we help customers

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
with you know on a daily basis i say

184
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,360
what i'm hearing is your objectives

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
might be this and i try to help shape

186
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,479
those but a lot of times those

187
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
objectives tend to be things like you

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
know

189
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
what was taken how did they get in are

190
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
they still here all of those things

191
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,759
right

192
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,960
but some of the questions that's a

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,479
really important one and then some of

194
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,520
those additional questions that i'm

195
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,199
going to ask are you know in your

196
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,560
organization is there protected

197
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,080
information phi pci pfi

198
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
you know regular old

199
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,840
pii um is there something that we need

200
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,240
to be concerned about um that may have

201
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
left your organization that may need to

202
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
be protected that may need to have

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
notifications made right what

204
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,759
notifications would need to happen based

205
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
on the information that you have do you

206
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
know that as an organization what

207
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
and and what sort of obligations do you

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
have not only for those for those

209
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,319
notifications but what sort of

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
contractual obligations do you have for

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
instance if you're hard down

212
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,599
and you have product to ship do you know

213
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
what those obligations are

214
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
and then what are your most critical

215
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
assets if you're hard down your most

216
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,720
critical assets are probably the ones

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
that need to come up first

218
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,560
do you know what priority that is do you

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
know where those sit do you know who the

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
owners of those data are all those

221
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,039
things

222
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,000
and how long can you be down so some

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
organizations can be down for days at a

224
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,560
time because having internet access or

225
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,520
having

226
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
systems down maybe isn't the core of

227
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
their business for other businesses if

228
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
they're down for even hours that can be

229
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
millions of dollars lost so it really

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
depends and it's something that your

231
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
organization needs to know again it

232
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,680
depends

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
so the answers really

234
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
again are varied and different a love

235
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,440
office space

236
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
it really depends on who you are what

237
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
industry what your actual business is

238
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,520
what your business model is again do you

239
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
need the internet for work could be down

240
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,039
for days and it doesn't really matter to

241
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
you may need to be up right away

242
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,039
what are your local provincial federal

243
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
laws that are applicable to your

244
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,919
organization what organizations uh have

245
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,319
do you have obligations to contractually

246
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,639
that sort of thing where else do you do

247
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,840
business um so if you've lost some data

248
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,120
and you do business in in europe as well

249
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,399
gdpr may be maybe a thing for you there

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,159
might be some other things the singapore

251
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,599
laws are very very strict if you're

252
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
doing if you're doing business over in

253
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,720
asia that might be something you need to

254
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,399
be aware of if data goes missing from

255
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,920
there or if you're hard down in that

256
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,519
environment

257
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,160
business partners contracts your

258
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,920
customers obviously all of these things

259
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
are things that we need to understand

260
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
right again it depends it really depends

261
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
on your organization and many many other

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
things

263
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
so

264
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,720
this is how this typically goes uh when

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
we uh when we're planning for instant

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,480
response

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
we go out

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,080
and we read a lot of things we ask some

269
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
questions

270
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,880
we might even have some trusted advisors

271
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
in and say what are the best practices

272
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,399
for

273
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
us to

274
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,399
best

275
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
understand how we might respond to an

276
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
incident what do we need and there's a

277
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
lot of answers out there around you know

278
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,480
you can go to nist and and i'm going to

279
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
say i'm going to call it a few other

280
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
things in in this organization in in

281
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
this presentation but i

282
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
everybody gives good information

283
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
everybody is out there giving the best

284
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,760
information that they can trying to make

285
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
your organization help your organization

286
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
be better at responding what i'm saying

287
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
is still do all of that look for all

288
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
that information but then as an

289
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
organization look at it and figure out

290
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
what makes the most sense for your

291
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
organization so go out there and check

292
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
those best practices but generally then

293
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
what happens is they go they take those

294
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
at face value and go well that's the

295
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
best practice they say we should go out

296
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
we should spend three million dollars on

297
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
a sim we should keep everything for a

298
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
year and we're going to keep all of the

299
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,360
things

300
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
or we're going to we're going to keep

301
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
this thing because it says this thing is

302
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,160
the most important and maybe that's

303
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
firewall logs who knows

304
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
but we also need to check our budget

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
maybe we can't afford a three million

306
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
dollar sim so okay so

307
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
maybe we only have this much money and

308
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
we can only do this thing okay well then

309
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,839
we're gonna go okay well from that we're

310
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,600
gonna go well here's the best practices

311
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
and we we think those are okay and we've

312
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
got this much money and so we're going

313
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,399
to go and we're going to collect what is

314
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,079
recommended and what we can afford right

315
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,440
so we're going to figure out how we're

316
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,880
going to do that and collect that and

317
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
then we're going to keep for let's say

318
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,680
this says we're going to keep it for a

319
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
year so we're going to keep it for a

320
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
year because that makes sense we're

321
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,640
going to keep it for a year um

322
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
there's another way that this is done

323
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,200
and this is something that i see really

324
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
frequently is one

325
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
uh we have no idea what we will need if

326
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,480
our worst nightmare comes true we have

327
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
no idea what we're going to need

328
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
so we've made no plan for that um and uh

329
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,320
when i say

330
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
for instance do your active directory

331
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
logs get sent somewhere centrally no

332
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
do your firewall logs get sent somewhere

333
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,560
centrally no they're just on the local

334
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
appliance okay so that's the default

335
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,519
settings

336
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440
that's the default settings

337
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
which means you have no log retention

338
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,279
right so they're not kept for any length

339
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,880
of time they probably rolled over

340
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,720
because they are no longer available

341
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
uh and

342
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
we're really working on thoughts and

343
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
prayers at that point we're hoping the

344
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,920
worst doesn't happen um and when it does

345
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,279
we're working on those prayers to hope

346
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
that we still have a job at the end of

347
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
it um

348
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
so i think when we think about this

349
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
scenario this is this is the worst case

350
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,519
scenario of the worst case scenario

351
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,800
right when we get into that worst case

352
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,480
scenario we're having all these people

353
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,839
ask us questions about how we're going

354
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
to respond how we're going to recover

355
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
and we go well we're not really sure

356
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
um and

357
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
and those are when those those

358
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
conversations around you know how are we

359
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
going to actually

360
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,079
um be a business next week if we don't

361
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,519
know the answer to these questions come

362
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,360
in

363
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
so this is what i'm suggesting now and i

364
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,800
will say that this this presentation is

365
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,079
not around recovery necessarily i'm not

366
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,279
going to answer

367
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
all the questions what i'm specifically

368
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
talking about is what happens when the

369
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
worst case scenario of your organization

370
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
happens and you needed to do an

371
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
investigation or you needed to recover

372
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
quickly

373
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
what are some of the questions that you

374
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
would need to know right away

375
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
so what i'm suggesting is we go back to

376
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
the bottom we take that worst case

377
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,120
scenario we start there we say here for

378
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
our organization is the worst case

379
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
scenario that could happen we figure out

380
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
what that looks like for us

381
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
i'm going to go through a few things

382
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
after this a few different scenarios

383
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
hopefully hopefully

384
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
flesh that out a little bit but we

385
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,839
understand what that that worst case

386
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
scenario might look like

387
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
and then we say

388
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
when that worst case scenario happens

389
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,560
our objectives in the in the

390
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
investigation that follows in the

391
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
in the

392
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,880
months or hopefully days or weeks that

393
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
follow that our objectives for getting

394
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,399
back to business would be

395
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,720
this

396
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
finesse those and then figure out from

397
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,880
those objectives

398
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
what would we need to collect as a

399
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
business from an investigative

400
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,720
perspective from a recovery perspective

401
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
to understand how we might

402
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
get to where we need to be to answer

403
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,279
those objectives

404
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,720
and then how are we going to get there

405
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
so the how piece is going to be a little

406
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
bit around you know how do we do those

407
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
things how do we collect those things

408
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,440
where are we going to put them all those

409
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,959
sorts of things but also around the

410
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,160
little bit around budget but i'm not

411
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,680
going to talk early about budget today

412
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
but understand that that's a big

413
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,920
component in this as well

414
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,360
so

415
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
again

416
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
what kind of organization are you this

417
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,560
all of these questions are really going

418
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,480
to depend on what organization you are

419
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
what are your objectives what's your

420
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,440
industry what's your vertical what's

421
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
your risk profile all of those things we

422
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,959
have to be thinking about and i'm not

423
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,320
going to answer those questions today

424
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
i'm just going to hopefully poke you

425
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
along your way to being able to think

426
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
about those things with your team and

427
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
understand maybe what those things you

428
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
are and so you can start planning for

429
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
that um we go through you know again

430
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
hundreds of investigations a year and

431
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,839
every time that i have to say to a

432
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,880
client

433
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
i just

434
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,600
can't answer this question for you

435
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,360
because this thing didn't exist and i

436
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,880
wish that it did

437
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
but we can't go back and make it um it

438
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,959
is very frustrating for us it's very

439
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,800
frustrating for them it's frustrating

440
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
for any folks that they have to notify

441
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,079
for instance if they have data stolen so

442
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,199
we want to make sure that we're thinking

443
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,639
about those things first and working

444
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,079
backwards starting from the bottom if

445
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
you will

446
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,639
so

447
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,079
i'm going to generalize a lot here and

448
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,199
say that there are three types of

449
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
organizations there's probably many more

450
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
than this

451
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
but i'm going to start with this three

452
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
data rich so these are organizations

453
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,760
where

454
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
it doesn't really matter whether things

455
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,920
go down as long as the data is safe

456
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
as long as the data didn't leave as long

457
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
as the data wasn't damaged

458
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,959
and

459
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,519
as long as that data is secure and safe

460
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,720
we don't have to worry that uh

461
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
that the that we the internet is down

462
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,240
that we're down for days at a time maybe

463
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
even because that data is safe we can

464
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,880
continue going and it's okay

465
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
then there's the asset rich and this is

466
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,480
a little bit of a misnomer but when i

467
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
say asset rich what i mean is that for

468
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,360
these organizations as long as their

469
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,199
infrastructure is running

470
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,160
as long as everything's continuing to go

471
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
that

472
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
the data on it is maybe transient it

473
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,279
doesn't really matter what that data is

474
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,759
or rather that date is perhaps damaged

475
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,920
as long as the assets are up and running

476
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
and things are still moving money is

477
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
still flowing products still shipping

478
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,000
that's the most important thing but then

479
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,839
we have that hybrid which is both of

480
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
those things are important we have to

481
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
have the data the data is very important

482
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,560
maybe it's some sort of protected

483
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,199
information but also having those assets

484
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,639
up and running is critical to the

485
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,839
organization

486
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
obviously that

487
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,519
is really a big generalization and

488
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,800
there's a lot of different there's a lot

489
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
of gray area in there but we're going to

490
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,440
deal with those things today

491
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,959
so

492
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
let's start with a data rich

493
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
organization and i've chosen something

494
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,079
really sort of um

495
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,600
out there we've had a lot of supply

496
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
chain attacks in in the last year

497
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
um a year and a half even um so i wanted

498
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
to choose something that i think was was

499
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,360
a little germane to that so data rich

500
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
organizations let's talk about a

501
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,639
software development company you are a

502
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,279
software development company and your

503
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,360
worst case scenario is that the threat

504
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
actor

505
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
a threat actor has gotten in touch with

506
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,160
you in some way and they have threatened

507
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
the release of the entire source code of

508
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,880
your super mega popular software that

509
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
you get millions and millions of dollars

510
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,560
from subscriptions and license sales

511
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
every year and if it goes out into

512
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,279
public

513
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,040
i mean your business is finished

514
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
additionally they've also stolen your

515
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
customer data and they're threatening to

516
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
release that as well so not only do we

517
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,119
have a threat to you know what is the

518
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
core of your business your source code

519
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
but also you know there's a lot of brand

520
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,160
and reputation issue that's going to go

521
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,880
on with regards to customer data

522
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
possibly being leaked

523
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,000
so

524
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
i've listed some objectives that we

525
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,240
might want to think about we're going to

526
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
go to that and we're going to this is

527
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
our worst case scenario so what would

528
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,039
happen if that happened what objectives

529
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,880
would be the most important and when i

530
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,960
think about customers that i speak to on

531
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
a regular basis

532
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,240
the biggest question and that

533
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
particularly this is for the lawyers the

534
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
biggest question is what was taken

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,520
and how much was taken

536
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
um and a lot of times you get those

537
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
conversations with well the threat actor

538
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
says they have

539
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,559
1.2 terabytes

540
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,880
but we don't have that much data

541
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,000
you know well

542
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,799
maybe you do maybe you don't um

543
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,559
it you know really depends on how aware

544
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,679
that particular person that you're

545
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,840
talking to is of what their estate

546
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,000
really looks like um but also we've

547
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,679
known threat actors to be a little fast

548
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
and loose with with the truth as well so

549
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,679
uh and they don't always tell you what

550
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,120
the proof of life they may not always

551
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,160
send you

552
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
everything you know proof of whatever

553
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
they've taken

554
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
so it's difficult what have they taken

555
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
and that's very very important for

556
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,000
notifications

557
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,039
so how much and and what was taken means

558
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,960
who do we have to notify

559
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
how many people do we have to notify if

560
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
it's customer data for instance are

561
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,919
there any regulators that need to know

562
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,160
all of those things um is very important

563
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
with that question so that's why that's

564
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
bolded because for a company that

565
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,440
particularly has had data taken um

566
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,039
anything with protected information

567
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,160
that's associated with that that

568
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
question is number one really and then

569
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
obviously we get the ones of how did it

570
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,039
happen

571
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
are they still in our environment

572
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
and the who needs to know and i talked a

573
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,919
little bit about that regulators

574
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
notifications all of those things

575
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
customers how do we who needs to know

576
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,320
about how what this happened

577
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
so from there if we understand what

578
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
those objectives look like

579
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
we want to understand then you know what

580
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,480
do we collect

581
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,799
data exfiltration is one of the most

582
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
difficult things to prove and one of the

583
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
reasons for that is because one of the

584
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
best ways to prove data exfiltration

585
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
happened is pcap

586
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,640
exactly what has flowed out packet by

587
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,320
packet what has flowed out of the

588
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,520
network

589
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
is the best way for me as an instant

590
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,000
responder to tell you what has left your

591
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
network

592
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
and what i will tell you also as an

593
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,919
instant responder of many years is that

594
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,880
i have seen pcapp probably i can count

595
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,840
on one hand companies that have had full

596
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
pcap for any length of time it's

597
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,559
expensive it's it's it's difficult to

598
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,520
store all of those things um it takes up

599
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
a lot of room uh and so that's that's a

600
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,039
difficult thing but we can also talk

601
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,120
about things like netflow for instance

602
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
um which is a lot easier and i'm not

603
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
going to debate the the the merits of

604
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,679
one thing over another but network data

605
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,160
is the best way for me to tell you uh

606
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
what has left your environment

607
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
but we've also used great things like

608
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,480
for instance what file and folders were

609
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,600
were touched process execution i worked

610
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,080
with company recently who was storing

611
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,360
all process execution 4688 events in

612
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,679
their splunk which was fantastic because

613
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
what we were able to do is actually go

614
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,440
into their splunk

615
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
look at process execution events for the

616
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
thread actors using rclone we're able to

617
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
see the process execution uh string so

618
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,080
our clone was executed we could see what

619
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
folder that they were attempting to copy

620
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,120
out

621
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
to the file transfer file the site that

622
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
they were using and that was very very

623
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,840
helpful and being able to answer that

624
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
question of what was taken not

625
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
necessarily how much but the what was

626
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,039
taken was much easier to answer when

627
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,320
that was when that was placed so that's

628
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
something to think about how would we

629
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
get that information what for instance

630
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,799
events

631
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,480
would would help us do that and how

632
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
would we collect that

633
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
so again more logs also really important

634
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
but sort of in that priority we're going

635
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,200
to start at the network data

636
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
and last but not least is how so

637
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,679
how long do we have to have this data so

638
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,320
if we collect the pcap data how long

639
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,960
should we keep that for again difficult

640
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,000
to store because it's huge um and and

641
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
how long do we want to store that data

642
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,039
for um again it depends on your industry

643
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,880
how long do you how how long you need to

644
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
keep things for whether it's logs

645
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,000
whether it's peak update or whether it's

646
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
whatever are really going to depend on

647
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,159
your risk your vertical

648
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
your ability to store that from a

649
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
budgetary and from a storage perspective

650
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
how will we how will we collect it so

651
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,720
that's another thing if you're a very

652
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
distributed organization perhaps

653
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
collecting that data is going to be a

654
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,440
lot more difficult so we have to

655
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
understand how we're going to collect it

656
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,760
and then where are we going to store it

657
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,799
we're going to store it essentially

658
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,320
we're going to store it in the cloud are

659
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,559
we going to have a

660
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
managed service provider help us with

661
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,360
that

662
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,799
those are always interesting questions

663
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,760
because

664
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
for instance when we're working with

665
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
managed service providers and

666
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
is how do we get that data back if we

667
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
want to use that for an investigation

668
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
and that's something that i've run into

669
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
a little bit that has been difficult

670
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
with organizations using managed managed

671
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,960
providers

672
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
that data may not be all that easy

673
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
to look at

674
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
and to get for an investigation if you

675
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,360
need it

676
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
and also you know how long do we keep it

677
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,640
for you know how long do we need it is

678
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,760
there any any regulatory or or or laws

679
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
that say we have to keep it for a

680
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,919
certain amount of time is it that year

681
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,720
that nist tells us or is it less for our

682
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
organization how far do we want to be

683
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,679
able to look back

684
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,880
again it depends

685
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
all right

686
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
how about organizations that are data

687
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
rich and i chose a manufacturer for this

688
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,080
and by this i'm seeing a manufacturer

689
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
that manufactures something for someone

690
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
else let's say you go to a manufacturer

691
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
and i say i have this here's my designs

692
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,080
i am the owner of the intellectual

693
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,000
property and i'm just getting them to

694
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
build that thing for me um so they're

695
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
they're they're somebody that doesn't

696
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,840
really care about the data the data goes

697
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
missing not their problem not their data

698
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,640
all they're doing is they're building

699
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,400
stuff but if they can't build things if

700
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
they can't ship out product

701
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
then they're losing millions of dollars

702
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,440
so

703
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
maybe a threat actor brings you hard

704
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
down with some sort of ransomware

705
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,039
encrypting your systems and you're no

706
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,520
longer able to produce the things ship

707
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
product

708
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
and you're losing money every day

709
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
so your biggest objective isn't

710
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
necessarily the what was taken because

711
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,000
you don't care about the data it's not

712
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
your data

713
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,280
you want to get back up and running but

714
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,799
you might also be interested in the

715
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,200
other things like how did it happen did

716
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
they move laterally what did they do in

717
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,799
our environment because you want to make

718
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,919
sure that it doesn't happen again

719
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,960
obviously so this sort of thing is

720
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,000
happening so there are all those

721
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
objectives we still want to think about

722
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,280
but probably the primary one there is we

723
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,400
need to get back up and running as

724
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,120
quickly as possible

725
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
so from that perspective you're probably

726
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,720
what is going to be

727
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
what's our most critical assets what

728
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,400
needs to come back up and running

729
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,039
and how do we list that um

730
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,200
that priority list what's what's on our

731
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
priority list what needs to come up

732
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,120
first critical assets might be critical

733
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
because they need to come up first or

734
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,600
because

735
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
um

736
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
because of the data they hold so in this

737
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
case we're not going to talk about the

738
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
data but but they want to make sure

739
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,400
what's coming up first and what's that

740
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,679
recovery list like is what are the

741
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,520
dependencies for that so we need to know

742
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
things like who owns that process who

743
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
owns that server who owns that that

744
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,679
appliance so we can make sure that

745
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
things come up in the right way that

746
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
they're tested all those things we need

747
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
to understand that what

748
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
and again

749
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
all of the logs right

750
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
if something was down if we had a

751
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
ransomware event we definitely want some

752
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,799
for instance authentication logs

753
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
understanding you know what accounts

754
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
they were using well what what did they

755
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
what how did they move laterally from

756
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,760
system to system was there you know

757
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
anything used from process education uh

758
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
process execution perspective like did

759
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
they use ps exec to move from system to

760
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,440
system to help deploy that that

761
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
ransomware for instance what other files

762
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
and folders they touch might be

763
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
important might not be who knows in this

764
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,360
case

765
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,320
um

766
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
but the big house on this list is

767
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,360
probably the how long can we be down

768
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,679
before you know our business is at a

769
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,600
critical place that we can no longer

770
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,039
recover from

771
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,640
and then again with that recovery

772
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
priority list what should be recovering

773
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
first second third fourth how do we get

774
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
back to business really really quickly

775
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,919
but we still want to answer those

776
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,240
questions around for an investigation

777
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
perspective um you know how do we how do

778
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
we understand what our critical assets

779
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
are how do we collect that information

780
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,679
and for some organizations that is very

781
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,159
difficult um how do we understand what

782
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,880
those recovery priorities are you know

783
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
that again is conversations with with

784
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,799
stakeholders

785
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,320
business owners

786
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,880
server owners etc and so forth

787
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
for that data where do we store it

788
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
whether it's logs or whether it's in a

789
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
critical asset list where are we going

790
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,600
to store it where we can get to it when

791
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,360
we need it that's an interesting one

792
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,760
from the perspective of in an incident

793
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
and you're hard down if your list of

794
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
what your critical assets are as well as

795
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,799
your recovery priority list is on a

796
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,480
system that was encrypted

797
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
you're out of luck you've done all this

798
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,000
work and now you can't even use it

799
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,919
and again with logs and whatnot how long

800
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,240
do we keep it for um and and what's

801
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
important to our industry because there

802
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,240
may be some uh things that are germane

803
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,559
to a manufacturer vertical

804
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,559
that may not be to a software

805
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,360
development company

806
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,159
so data rich organizations uh

807
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,320
sorry this should be data and asset rich

808
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,559
organizations this i didn't catch that

809
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,880
when i was building my slides so data

810
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
and asset rich organizations and i've

811
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,919
chosen a healthcare provider for this

812
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:32,960
one

813
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
and we think about that the data is

814
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
important right patient data phi really

815
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,400
important

816
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
that would be our number one thing right

817
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,799
if data was lost you know

818
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,760
myself as as as a consumer of a health

819
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,360
care provider i want to make sure my

820
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
data is safe

821
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,760
but

822
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
what about if all their systems are hard

823
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,760
down isn't that more important if their

824
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
systems are hard down they're not able

825
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
to service their customers and that

826
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
might be more critical

827
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,480
right might depend on the healthcare

828
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,120
provider so again the question is you

829
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,200
know the answer really is it depends it

830
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,360
depends even within the healthcare

831
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
vertical

832
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,760
whether

833
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
data or assets might be more important

834
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,559
but i think

835
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,000
they're likely to be

836
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
at least not necessarily equally

837
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,960
important but there's going to be some

838
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,399
balance there

839
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
so the objectives are really going to

840
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
follow back again to all the things we

841
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
talked about previously um but those two

842
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
big ones are going to be

843
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,399
you know if data was taken

844
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,159
what was taken and how much was taken

845
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,440
because that's critical for

846
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,240
notifications uh not just in canada but

847
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
also into the us

848
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,159
um and and the number of places around

849
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,320
the world healthcare information very

850
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,880
very protected and we want to make have

851
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,120
make notifications if we need to to the

852
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,440
folks that that need to be they need to

853
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
be notified so that's a huge piece those

854
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
are also really protected by deadlines

855
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,480
right so the lawyers are very interested

856
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,399
in how much was taken what was taken

857
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,000
because they need to be able to answer

858
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
those questions within a specific period

859
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
of time but also

860
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
we need to get back up and running there

861
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,559
is patient care to be done and uh and so

862
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,640
without critical systems

863
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,399
we don't we aren't able to service those

864
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,559
customers that are most in need so we

865
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,000
want to make sure that we understand

866
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
what are our critical assets how do they

867
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,279
get back up

868
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
um and and where do we go from here

869
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
right so there's a balance there and

870
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
there may be two maybe work streams in

871
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
this particular vertical this particular

872
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,399
type of organization that might need to

873
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,919
be followed so that's something to be

874
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,919
thinking about when you're considering

875
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
that worst case scenario

876
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
and how do we balance that out right so

877
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,679
those are the those are the

878
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,679
conversations we want to have beforehand

879
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,279
so we can understand

880
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
what that priority list looks like so

881
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,880
yes probably losing all that data you

882
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,240
know if i was going to say a big a big

883
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,600
hospital for instance losing all that

884
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,279
data it's going to be really important

885
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,240
it's definitely going to be a work

886
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
stream but likely there's going to be

887
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,159
people whose voices about patient care

888
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
are going to be much louder in that

889
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,960
conversation

890
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,399
again depending on the organization but

891
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,000
a big hospital that's probably going to

892
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,279
be patient care is going to be number

893
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,360
one so that's probably going to win out

894
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
on that pendulum of what's the most

895
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,520
important

896
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,799
so again i'm going to say this the

897
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,440
cardinal rule of all of this is it

898
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
depends

899
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,279
your organization and applying sort of

900
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,360
this look at what's your worst case

901
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,559
scenario

902
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,960
and what your objectives might be in

903
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
that are going to really depend

904
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,520
on so many things that are really very

905
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,679
focused on your organization

906
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,480
um

907
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,760
as as an organization at crowdstrike

908
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,600
from a you know what's our worst case

909
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,919
scenario we actually you know have a few

910
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
obviously but we have a very large

911
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,440
um obviously product environment with a

912
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,600
lot of intellectual property so that

913
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,679
would be very very important for us but

914
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,120
we also

915
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
are an instant response firm that

916
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
collects a lot of data from a lot of

917
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,279
different companies so um you know from

918
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,960
a data perspective that would be very

919
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
difficult we also

920
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,840
have a managed service um so if our

921
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
systems went down hard we would not be

922
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,679
able to help our customers and so we

923
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,120
there's we're kind of one of those mixed

924
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
hybrid organizations right we have a few

925
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,840
different things that we'd really be

926
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,679
thinking about and what i want you to be

927
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,600
thinking about is your organization and

928
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,200
what that worst case scenario and what

929
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,039
that objective looks like for you

930
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
so we thought about this we've gone

931
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,840
through

932
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
we've decided what our worst case

933
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
scenario is

934
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,799
we

935
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,279
understand what our objectives might be

936
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,240
in that situation

937
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,520
we think we know what we're going to

938
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,440
collect how long we need to keep it how

939
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,760
we're going to collect it

940
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440
and this is kind of where that whole

941
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,279
budget conversation comes in and i'm not

942
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,120
going to belabor it really but the other

943
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,640
piece is support so

944
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,240
when we think about

945
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,919
here are the things that we would need

946
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,240
in a worst-case scenario

947
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,799
you need to have allies to help you push

948
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,240
that agenda

949
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,679
and

950
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
depending on your organization depending

951
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,600
on your vertical your size all those

952
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
things your allies are going to be

953
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,039
different there's going to be a few

954
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,480
similarities but they are going to be

955
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,720
different so looking at that a little

956
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
bit

957
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,159
we've got the data rich for instance

958
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,640
when data goes missing the first people

959
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
that care

960
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,600
besides yourself as the security

961
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,519
operations person for instance

962
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,799
is

963
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
the legal team

964
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,159
and usually the privacy officers right

965
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,320
they sends them into quite a tizzy and a

966
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,360
lot of the times when we talk to um to

967
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,600
security teams to it teams who call us

968
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
for an instant response one of our first

969
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,640
questions is

970
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
have you spoken to your internal legal

971
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,360
team or have you engaged external

972
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
counsel

973
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,039
and when the question when the answer is

974
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,159
no

975
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,120
um that's a little concerning for us

976
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,279
and the reason for that is is because in

977
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,720
this day and age

978
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,360
any data going missing is going to set

979
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,960
off alarm bells for any person um with a

980
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
legal degree

981
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,760
so

982
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,440
if you haven't engaged those folks in

983
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,200
your organization legal team privacy

984
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,120
officer those might be the same people

985
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
um i highly recommend you're doing that

986
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,080
as soon as possible in fact in the

987
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,320
planning process include them in this

988
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,679
planning process because their worst

989
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,360
case scenario might be different from

990
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,720
yours

991
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
and they may have a good reason for that

992
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,000
and that might be your organization's

993
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,519
worst case scenario that you really

994
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,279
hadn't thought of

995
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,559
the other people that might be really

996
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,640
interested and this is not an

997
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,039
all-encompassing list on any of these is

998
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,480
the data owners for instance if you have

999
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,640
data going missing those data owners one

1000
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,240
might be your best source of information

1001
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,559
about what that data was um and where it

1002
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,720
was but also

1003
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
they're the owners of that information

1004
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,000
and they're pretty protective of it so

1005
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,919
if it goes missing um they're going to

1006
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,440
be really concerned or if it's damaged

1007
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,880
or otherwise they're going to be really

1008
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
concerned about that and want to be

1009
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,480
involved in any of that process which

1010
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
means that if you're looking for support

1011
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,519
on how to protect that how to make sure

1012
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,320
that

1013
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,399
it is you know if it goes out the door

1014
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,440
what it was how it was taken etc those

1015
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,679
three groups particularly are going to

1016
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,240
be hardcore on your side to help you get

1017
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
what you need to the what and the how um

1018
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,399
collect that data store it understand

1019
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,919
what you need how long you need to keep

1020
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,640
it

1021
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,279
from an asset perspective again legal

1022
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,799
team they're going to want to know for

1023
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,720
sure if you're hard down and you're

1024
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,559
losing money the other people on that

1025
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,960
side is is any of the finance folks i

1026
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,720
should have included those but any

1027
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,360
finance folks um if you're losing money

1028
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,679
uh that your cfo is going to be on your

1029
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,159
side for understanding how to best get

1030
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,000
you guys back up and running as quickly

1031
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,240
as possible asset owners are big for

1032
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,840
that as well anybody in the production

1033
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,919
or operation side i was particularly

1034
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,120
going to be interested in making sure

1035
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,200
that we can ship product out those sales

1036
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
folks they're going to be right in your

1037
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
back pocket helping you push this

1038
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,000
forward right

1039
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,960
they want to make sure that their

1040
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,880
customers get their orders so if you're

1041
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,360
hard down and you can't ship product

1042
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,120
those guys aren't getting their bonuses

1043
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,760
so you know find your allies if you need

1044
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,399
help to push your agenda forward these

1045
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,679
are the folks you want to talk to and

1046
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,599
again with those asset and data rich

1047
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,520
organizations

1048
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,800
all of the above particularly in in my

1049
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
scenario with the health care provider

1050
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,280
your legal and your privacy team are

1051
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,359
going to be your best allies in

1052
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,639
understanding how to get from d to a

1053
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,359
from worst case scenario back to uh back

1054
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,239
to the how right

1055
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,918
okay

1056
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,839
i'm going to recap a little bit here

1057
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,119
when we look at situations a lot of

1058
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
times we look forward we plan and i

1059
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,480
think that's a big thing in interior

1060
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,560
response we talk about how we look

1061
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,599
forward um what's our plan

1062
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,839
um and and how do we understand you know

1063
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,280
if we had an incident we do this and

1064
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,599
then we do this and then we do this

1065
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,639
and

1066
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,800
again what i'm suggesting is in this

1067
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,960
scenario is that we look at that worst

1068
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,880
case scenario first for your

1069
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,359
organization is it something that has to

1070
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,599
do with data is it something that has to

1071
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,119
do with being down is it something in

1072
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
between that and if it is something

1073
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
between that what's your priorities

1074
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,280
there understanding um what that worst

1075
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
case scenario looks like for your

1076
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
organization

1077
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,320
and then saying okay if we had that

1078
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,640
situation happen what would be our

1079
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,599
organization's number one objective

1080
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,960
in in getting to where we needed to be

1081
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
and and then and then what are the

1082
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
following priorities after that um and i

1083
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
think what's important about that is

1084
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,680
from an incident response perspective my

1085
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,400
priorities um or my objectives generally

1086
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,240
tend to be investigative

1087
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,440
um so

1088
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,280
i'm gonna want to know the what the why

1089
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
the who all the things not necessarily

1090
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
the why necessarily but but the what and

1091
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,760
the how and and the who we really try to

1092
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
sew up um but from your organization's

1093
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,079
perspective that might be important but

1094
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,599
getting back up and running for instance

1095
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,320
might be more important um so my my

1096
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,000
priorities might not be your priorities

1097
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
and it's really important to understand

1098
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,280
when i come in and i ask some questions

1099
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
i don't want my priorities to take over

1100
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
what yours should be i want you guys to

1101
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,079
have thought about that i want it to be

1102
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,400
in your you know if i say hey what's

1103
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,599
your objectives i want you to be able to

1104
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,200
just state those out for me and make

1105
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,320
sure

1106
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,119
that they are reflective of your risk

1107
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
your organization your vertical your

1108
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,800
obligations

1109
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,920
and then we want to make sure that you

1110
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,839
can meet those objectives so how do you

1111
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,359
meet those objectives

1112
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,720
from the priority list we're going to

1113
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,240
try to meet this one first obviously and

1114
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
then go to the second one

1115
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,680
understand what we need from an

1116
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,599
evidentiary perspective what we need

1117
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,680
from a recovery perspective with those

1118
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,920
critical assets that's their priority

1119
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,000
etc and so forth

1120
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,160
and then how do we make that happen so

1121
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,680
here's the thing we found out that we

1122
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,760
needed but how do we make that happen

1123
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,440
and smaller organizations that can be

1124
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,520
more difficult obviously we may need

1125
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,240
external help for that um to help some

1126
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
of those things happen there may not be

1127
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,040
budget for everything which means we

1128
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,839
need to prioritize what that uh what the

1129
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,839
most important thing is so we can help

1130
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,640
you know

1131
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
help find a way to get to the best

1132
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,119
answer for larger organizations that

1133
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,720
tends to be a little easier question or

1134
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,960
a little easier answer a lot smaller

1135
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,119
nations not so not as much

1136
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,960
um and then the last thing is like i

1137
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,000
said find your allies make sure that you

1138
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,359
understand

1139
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,119
who the people whether they're in your

1140
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,800
organization or not your best friend

1141
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,119
might be law enforcement might be an

1142
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,880
external legal counsel

1143
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
might be a trusted advisor that you

1144
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,880
bring in to help find these things and

1145
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
and help push this agenda

1146
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,599
as a consultant i know and i've heard

1147
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,040
time and time again that um my word

1148
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,359
saying the same thing as the it guy

1149
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,160
that's been there for 15 years has been

1150
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
saying for the last 15 years

1151
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
me saying it as an outside consultant

1152
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,880
somehow carries greater weight um with

1153
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,920
the executive team frustrating but but

1154
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,079
usually true so if you need that trusted

1155
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,440
advisor to come in and help you push

1156
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
that agenda you know find those allies

1157
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,839
legal team privacy team make those folks

1158
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,079
part of of your team communications

1159
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,359
folks i didn't mention those but those

1160
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,760
are fantastic as well

1161
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,640
and help make that happen

1162
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,560
if you do that

1163
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
you will be able to weather that worst

1164
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,839
case scenario

1165
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,240
far better you'll be able to understand

1166
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,599
you know what that worst case scenario

1167
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,280
looks like how we're going to get to a

1168
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
place of recovery how we're going to get

1169
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,520
to a place of resolution that much

1170
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
better

1171
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,680
and hopefully then be able to handle the

1172
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,640
less than worst case scenarios with that

1173
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,400
same plan headed forward

1174
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,520
all right

1175
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
i want to say thank you

1189
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,079

1190
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,640
annie and i thank you all for being here

1191
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,599
today i appreciate the time and i'm not

1192
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,640
sure if there's a way to answer

1193
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,160
questions but if there is i absolutely

1194
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,720
am willing to do so

1195
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
i'm looking through the questions and

1196
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,240
see what i can answer

1197
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,520
uh okay so there's a question that was

1198
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,560
assuming we don't have any way for ssl

1199
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,640
intercept or decryption is pcap still

1200
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,000
valuable to have

1201
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,520
if it's just source destination

1202
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,680
information

1203
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,119
um

1204
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,400
i would say

1205
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,599
it depends again

1206
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,200
with the source destination information

1207
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,880
you might be better with netflow less

1208
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,640
less volume

1209
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
and and still be able to see netflow i

1210
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,000
love i'm a big fan of um because you've

1211
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,440
got your source

1212
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
and destination information as well as

1213
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,599
your bite sent received which is going

1214
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,560
to be you know pretty much uh as good as

1215
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
that encrypted peak app if you're not

1216
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,280
able able to decrypt that um and and at

1217
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,520
least give you an idea of of what the

1218
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,160
connections were and and how much data

1219
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,720
has been sent um and and and if that's

1220
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,000
if that's what you're dealing with i

1221
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
would kind of recommend netflow over

1222
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,400
pcapp um but but certainly um you know

1223
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,920
there's always value in in in in pcapp

1224
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
um depending if you're able to to uh to

1225
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,760
have that decryption point

1226
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,319
and let's see

1227
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
wondering how many noon exploits were

1228
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,839
also generated from the 30 gigs of ms

1229
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,960
code supposedly lapses i honestly have

1230
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,839
no idea um it it's i think it's going to

1231
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,280
be interested to see going forward as

1232
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
well how how much we see

1233
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
um

1234
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
and i i mean

1235
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,079
unfortunately there always seems to be a

1236
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,599
new zero day coming out whether it's

1237
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,640
microsoft source code or otherwise

1238
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,520
but

1239
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
you know here's my

1240
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
patch often patch frequently patch every

1241
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
day

1242
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,440
recommendation

1243
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
last one was curious what would be

1244
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,119
recommended free or affordable selection

1245
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,720
that allows for collection of netflow

1246
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,280
and pcapp for a small business uh good

1247
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,920
question um there's a few um i would

1248
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,800
really start with um the

1249
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
um

1250
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,760
uh what am i trying to think about the

1251
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,720
top of my head um

1252
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,839
the

1253
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,800
uh shoot

1254
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,720
uh there is a distribution of linux

1255
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,760
distribution that um that uh that has a

1256
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,880
whole bunch of different things in it

1257
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,960
and for whatever reason it's eluding me

1258
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,280
right now um but um there's a um a free

1259
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,400
version of

1260
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,119
why am i wow am i i'm just losing my

1261
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,200
losing my mind right now um i will post

1262
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,079
it on my on my uh blog it's uh

1263
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,599
www.nerdycity.com um

1264
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,400
when i

1265
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
my brain recovers and for some reason i

1266
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,359
can't think of the name of it off the

1267
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,640
top of my head um but uh um

1268
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,760
there's there's a great free

1269
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,280
distribution you can set up that will

1270
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
help collect heat net flow and and and

1271
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,640
you can do some pcap data as well um

1272
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,839
and

1273
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,520
i'm thinking it's

1274
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,200
yeah no it's it's gone from my head i

1275
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,520
don't know why um but uh there there are

1276
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
some options out there um i will uh

1277
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,640
welcome

1278
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,200
maybe

1279
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,040
that there's probably a few out there

1280
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,640
that might be one of them um

1281
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,839
but

1282
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,280
yes i don't know why my brain's not

1283
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,440
functioning today um

1284
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,280
yeah security onion thank you gabriel um

1285
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,560
security ending was what i was thinking

1286
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,119
about this so so there's a few um the

1287
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,680
security engine um has a few tools kind

1288
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,240
of mixed into it that you're able to set

1289
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,359
up and do some some some capture

1290
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,359
has a few other tools on there as well

1291
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,440
and it is very very helpful and and free

1292
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,560
and there's a lot of resources out there

1293
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,000
that you can use to you know sort of set

1294
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,079
that up and you can put it in a vm and

1295
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,560
do some collection there um it's it's

1296
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,160
what i have used at my house for a

1297
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,440
number of years and until i started

1298
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,160
doing a little bit more but

1299
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,200
awesome

1300
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,919
any additional questions

1301
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,359
when tyler said security editing as well

1302
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,520
eric said circada yes there's a few

1303
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,440
different security hazards sorakada on

1304
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,720
it um uh so absolutely those are great

1305

answers thank you guys so much for that

1306
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,280
i don't know why my brain wasn't working

1307
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,160
but um

1308
