geoscience

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
i moved into security via it which was

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,520
already a second career so i bring a

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,200
really broad background having been on

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,759
the outside as a customer of i.t and uh

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,520
security as well as kind of you know

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,520
being here in the thick of it so

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
all right and so i'll get i'll introduce

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
our agenda a little bit today and then

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
i'll get started right

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
get right to the meat of it so today

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
we're going to talk about what is the

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,320
security awareness program to start then

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,799
we'll talk about why you should care and

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,520
then why your employees should care

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
we're also going to talk about different

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
types of learners

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,920
we're going to talk about how you can

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
start creating a program yourself

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,479
and lastly penny's going to talk in

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
detail about how you can mature your

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
program and your culture so once you've

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
created that security awareness program

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,079
where do you go next with that

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
all right and to get it started what is

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
a security awareness program well

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
everyone a lot of people have different

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,560
definitions this definition is

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
taken from the provincial government and

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,000
the definition says that the security

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
awareness program consists of a

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,000
formalized program with the goal of

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
training users of potential threats to

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
their organization and how to avoid

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
situations that might put the

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
organizational data at risk

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,879
so according to our own government here

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,640
in order to satisfy

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,519
the

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
this uh a security awareness program you

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
need to have the following you need to

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
have a documented program that is

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
followed and updated regularly through

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,959
policies

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,440
we need an annual information security

77
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
for employees

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
and part of this annual information

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
security we need to ensure that we

80
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,239
educate users on common threats and

81
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
impacted businesses such as not sharing

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
credentials

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,599
not clicking on suspicious links and

84
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
attachments reporting security incidents

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
maintaining your clean desk and locking

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
any inactive systems

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
they should also be tailored for

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
employee roles

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,720
and there should also be annual sign off

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,959
on the plan meaning that all your

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,640
employees should not only be doing it

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
going through the plan regularly on an

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
annual basis but also signing off to

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
ensure that you

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
that they actually have completed that

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,760
training

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
so this is the more formal definition of

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
a security awareness program now i want

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
to talk to you about what a security

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
awareness program means to me and penny

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
so

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
i believe that a security and firm

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
awareness a successful security

104
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
awareness program should be pushed from

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,400
the top down meaning from the board

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
level from the executive level meaning

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
that it shouldn't be your i.t team

108
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
begging the rest of the organization to

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,480
take cyber security seriously but it

110
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
should be your organization leading your

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
it team to implement security

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,480
technologies

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
right this is important because it's

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
gonna speed up your um

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
speed up your awareness program speed up

116
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
your entire security maturity very

117
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
quickly if you get your executives on

118
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
board

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,918
now staff actually need to understand

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,519
that they are doing cyber security

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
awareness training

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,280
right how many times do you have you

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,479
done a

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,000
some kind of awareness training with

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
some staff

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,440
maybe not even cyber security maybe hr

127
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
policy and the staff are just clicking

128
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
next trying to get through it and at the

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
end of the day they just um they see it

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,960
as

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
they could see it as just

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,639
a hindrance in their job oh there's

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
another hour that i have to spend doing

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,720
some kind of training right sometimes

135
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
staff will just skip to that training

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
and say they've done it so we've noticed

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,199
a lot of times when we ask staff

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,600
not within other organizations we say

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
hey did you do any cyber security

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
awareness training and they say um i

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,800
don't think so and then you talk to

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
their manager and you say well here's uh

143
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
the document they signed saying that

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
they did the annual training this year

145
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
right so make sure that they know that

146
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,320
they're doing security awareness

147
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
training and not just a regular kind of

148
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,960
policy reminder

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,160
you also need to ensure you have

150
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
tangible results based on your fishing

151
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,320
simulations and we'll talk about that in

152
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
more detail phishing simulators but

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
essentially you need to create you need

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,960
to uh figure out a way to have tangible

155
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
results when it comes to your security

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,479
awareness how do you know whether your

157
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,320
organization's getting better or worse

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,919
this can be done with phishing

159
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,960
simulations or even surveys

160
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
staff should not be afraid of the

161
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
security team and we'll get to some

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
stats about that later as well but you

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,520
do not want your staff to be afraid of

164
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
reporting any security incidents to you

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
you would actually rather have your

166
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,039
staff over share than undershare because

167
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,960
you don't want staff to feel like if

168
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
they accidentally got breached even if

169
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
it was by accident you don't want them

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,199
to be scared of you and therefore not

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
reporting

172
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,639
and lastly

173
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
privacy and security have a lot of

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,319
overlap so

175
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,080
this is a great time

176
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
to do privacy awareness training at the

177
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
same time as the security awareness

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
training there's a lot of things that

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
you can just simply

180
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
talk about the data more uh and why and

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
why you're doing what with the data you

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
know what are the regulations that your

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
organization might need to follow when

184
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
it comes to that data and now you're

185
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,160
also uh increasing you're sorry you're

186
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
also at

187
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
privacy to the security awareness

188
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
program

189
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,840
um

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
and the you know in a

191
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
in larger sort of more mature

192
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,520
organizations you'd actually have a

193
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,759
formal security awareness and training

194
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
program policy um which would give

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
high-level guidance on

196
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
when and how the training would be

197
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
provided as an onboarding and then

198
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
ongoing how often the training is

199
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
reviewed who approves it and the actual

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
uh enforcement mechanism and that policy

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
would be endorsed and approved at sort

202
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,199
of at an executive

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,680
level can be less formal in in other

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
words but in bigger orders it does tend

205
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
to be really formal like that

206
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,479
thank you penny

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,520
um now i do want to talk about why

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,120
you should care

209
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
so

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
there's a few stats that even when i

211
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,800
myself was reading them i got quite

212
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
surprised and we're going to go over a

213
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,479
lot of them today and hopefully this

214
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,919
will help you understand

215
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
why there's such a lack of security or

216
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
how we know that there's such a lack of

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
security awareness training in the

218
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
average organization

219
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,360
well 20 of staff are unsure if they

220
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
could describe the security risks with

221
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
storing work information and personal

222
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
cloud applications

223
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
so one in five staff

224
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
can't tell you what's wrong with storing

225
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
sensitive security uh sorry sensitive

226
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
work documents on their personal google

227
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
cloud

228
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,919
google drive in a dropbox

229
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,560
43 of employees are not aware that

230
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
clicking a suspicious link or opening an

231
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,280
unknown attachment in an email is likely

232
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
to lead to malware inspections

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
so four out of ten of your employees

234
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,039
don't actually think twice when clicking

235
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,440
on suspicious links or up opening

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,479
unknown

237
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
attachments a lot of them might think

238
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
that if they somebody has their email

239
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
then they obviously know this person and

240
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
we know that this is not the case

241
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,679
55

242
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
are not convinced that connecting their

243
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,159
laptop smartphone or tablet or public

244
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,640
public wi-fi network such as a coffee

245
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
shop or an airport

246
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,640
in the airport can lead to a malware

247
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,839
inspection

248
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
and as we know that

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,959
public wi-fi especially joining a random

250
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,519
public wi-fi can be a dangerous way uh

251
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
can be dangerous because it can lead to

252
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
malware infections man in the middle of

253
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
attack

254
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
uh things along those nature as once

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,640
you're on someone else's wi-fi

256
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,399
they can

257
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
they have a lot more access to you know

258
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
leads to trick you in different uh

259
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
phishing attacks

260
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
some employees are misinformed about

261
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,160
cyber security rights so 14

262
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
actually believe that if their computer

263
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
or mobile device is kept close to a

264
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
device that is already infected with

265
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
malware their device can also become

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
infected with that same malware

267
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,920
so

268
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,160
yes this might be right when it comes to

269
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
network there's devices on the same

270
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,279
network but just because you have one

271
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
iphone sitting beside another iphone

272
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
doesn't mean that the virus will be able

273
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
to transfer that's actually very

274
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
unlikely and but about 14 of employees

275
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
actually believe that is the case

276
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
50 percent of employees said that they

277
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
are very likely to report a security

278
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,519
incident

279
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
now that is a very small number of

280
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,760
people that are gonna report a security

281
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
incident

282
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
you would like to have that number above

283
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,160
90

284
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
um the reason being is that if there is

285
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
a security incident like i said earlier

286
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
you'd rather have your employees over

287
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
share than undershare right if

288
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
somebody clicked on a malware if they're

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
comfortable letting the security team

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,360
know you

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
the security team could get

292
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,200
you know a head start on remediating

293
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
that malware or

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
essentially isolating the you know the

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,760
user's computer from the network right

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,880
the more

297
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
data that your team has about the

298
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
security incidents that are happening or

299
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
even potential security incidents that

300
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
are happening in your organization the

301
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
better prepared your team will be to

302
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
fight back

303
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,800
or to remediate

304
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
and privacy best practices seem to be

305
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,519
even less well understood than cyber

306
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
security best practices so 66 percent of

307
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
staff did not know if their organization

308
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
needs to be complying with pci dss and

309
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,920
for those of you that don't know any

310
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
organization that takes any credit card

311
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
information needs to be compliant with

312
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
pci dss in some way or another so

313
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
two-thirds of all staff does don't even

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
know what compliancies that their

315
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
organization uh falls under

316
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,320
69

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
and the last stat here is 69 of

318
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
employees don't believe that storing

319
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
their personal data on their desktop and

320
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,560
laptop computers

321
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
such as their mobile devices can create

322
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,640
a policy violation so again just like

323
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,240
the previous slide here

324
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,399
most staff

325
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,880
don't know

326
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,399
why data needs to stay within

327
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
your organization they don't understand

328
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,040
the risks of taking data outside of your

329
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,600
organization so

330
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,880
you need to care that the staff um

331
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
you need to this is why you need to care

332
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,079
that staff

333
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,160
should be learning about cyber security

334
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
awareness so that you don't have as many

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,360
gaps like that within your organization

336
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,440
and so why should they care right

337
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,240
um

338
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
something to keep in mind there's

339
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
there's three

340
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
three fundamentals to uh creating a

341
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,839
cyber safe culture so first we have to

342
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
make people aware that's the core of the

343
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,240
program right but you also you have to

344
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
make them care because people don't act

345
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,320
without motivation now that motivation

346
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
can be extrinsic we can like make them

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,880
do it

348
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
but our long-term goal is to make that

349
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,279
intrinsic because they will care we need

350
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,360
to make them aware of the issues but we

351
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
also need to make them aware of the role

352
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,760
that they can play which leads to them

353
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
you know investing and and caring but

354
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
there's a last step which i'm just

355
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,839
getting you to think about here in sort

356
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,360
of the beginning i'll talk about it

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
later that we actually have to also make

358
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
sure that they can easily do the right

359
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
thing right because they can be aware

360
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,720
and they can care but if it's a lot of

361
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,639
friction for them to do the right thing

362
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,839
they're still not going to do it because

363
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,200
they have a job to do right you can't

364
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
make them fear doors but still expect

365
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,639
them to you know turn up inside the

366
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
building

367
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,399
yeah user experience can be sometimes

368
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,959
just as important as the actual security

369
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,760
tool themselves you know users are a lot

370
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
smarter than they even know let's just

371
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
say when it comes to getting around

372
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,399
security loopholes

373
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
the other thing i want to mention is

374
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,480
why you should care under the compliance

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
section so security awareness or

376
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
security program management security

377
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
awareness program management is actually

378
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
a requirement for

379
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,279
many if not most

380
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,519
compliance cyber security compliance

381
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,720
frameworks

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
i've listed a few here there's a few

383
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
that i haven't listed but essentially if

384
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
you look through all of them cyber

385
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,600
security canada pci dss sock 2 socks

386
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
hipaa iso cobit these are all really big

387
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
uh com sorry these are the most

388
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,639
well-known compliance frameworks and if

389
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,680
you actually look through the

390
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,160
requirements they're all very similar

391
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,079
when it comes to employee awareness

392
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,040
training

393
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
if you create a security awareness

394
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
program that fits all the requirements

395
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,800
that we talked about

396
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
on the first or second slide by the bc

397
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
government and we'll come back to that

398
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
later

399
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
if you create a program that fits those

400
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
requirements you will actually be able

401
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,040
to hit most of these compliances

402
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
most of these compliancy requirements

403
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,480
right so pci dss for example

404
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
um

405
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
needs you to educate employees but also

406
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
require employees

407
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
to acknowledge in writing right again

408
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,839
this is the formalized annual and

409
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,399
onboarding trainings and then the um

410
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
the annual sign off right if you if you

411
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,839
go to the sock 2 you need to

412
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
communicate information to improve

413
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,800
security knowledge and awareness

414
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,480
again

415
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,800
same thing can be used for sock too the

416
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,959
same program can be used for sock 2 and

417
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
pci dss

418
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,160
the main things that they all have in

419
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,440
common here is they educate employees

420
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
they need some kind of formal

421
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,639
acknowledgement so you need a sign off

422
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
and the last thing is that it a lot of

423
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,760
it

424
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,279
if possible needs to be role based

425
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,920
meaning that

426
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
you might want to do more intense

427
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
security awareness training for i t your

428
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,839
it team

429
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,360
versus the

430
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
your you know communications team

431
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
because your it team might have

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
much more

433
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,320
access to critical assets while your

434
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
communication team might only have

435
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,079
access to the minimum amount of user

436
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,240
information that they need for their job

437
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
right so

438
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,839
creating a security awareness program

439
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,440
isn't going to only make your

440
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,240
organization more secure

441
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
and potentially stop some of these uh

442
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,240
stats that we were mentioning or at

443
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,560
least lower them but it's also going to

444
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,880
make sure that you hit the compliances

445
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
that you're most likely required to in

446
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,720
some form or or another either way

447
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,360
now

448
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,079
your goal for security awareness

449
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,920
shouldn't be to just trick your staff um

450
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
or sorry well your goal when you're

451
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
doing phishing training training or

452
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,040
security awareness

453
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
isn't to um

454
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
throw as much information at them as

455
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,399
possible right you can send them papers

456
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,839
you can send them white papers you can

457
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,279
send them a lot you can even send them

458
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,880
on a course

459
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
but the most important thing

460
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,279
is to

461
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,519
change their mindset about cyber

462
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,639
security

463
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
right cyber security as the manager of

464
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
security cyber security isn't actually

465
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,440
my job i'm just curating the cyber

466
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
security of the organization cyber

467
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
security is every single staff's job

468
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
right every single staff should have

469
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,480
that in mind and that's what you want to

470
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
train your staff with the security

471
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
awareness training you're essentially

472
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
chaining changing your staff's mindset

473
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,280
to um

474
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
we can do whatever we want you know we

475
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,880
got a security team that's gonna you

476
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,959
know if we get hacked they've got these

477
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,959
antivirus in this firewall they'll

478
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,000
figure it out two we are the first line

479
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
of defense right you

480
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,319
the staff is the first person that's

481
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,919
going to be able to stop this phishing

482
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,880
attack

483
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,119
and for those of you that may not know

484
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,799
these days i believe

485
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,720
over 98

486
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
of attacks start with fishing

487
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,120
so you don't need to let

488
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
the fish get all the way to the

489
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
antivirus or all the way to your

490
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,440
firewall you can get the fish to stop

491
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
right from your email service

492
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
right from when your staff notices it

493
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,880
they can fish it what does that mean

494
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
well you can fish you can um

495
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
we'll talk about this in more detail

496
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,039
about the stuff you can actually

497
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
implement but you can actually implement

498
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,240
a fish alarm so every time there's a

499
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,000
phishing email you can get your staff to

500
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,480
report it and have it sent to your

501
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
security team

502
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
once and once your security team

503
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
is able to monitor those phishing emails

504
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,679
they can then make decisions for example

505
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
if we get this very sneaky phishing

506
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,400
email from one of our ceos or an

507
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
impersonation uh email from a ceo we can

508
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
take a look at that say oh yeah this is

509
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,400
definitely a fish and then we can run a

510
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
script to actually get rid of that from

511
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
everybody else's

512
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,799
inbox in our organization

513
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
so that first person that fished it

514
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
essentially

515
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
got rid of that malicious email for the

516
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
entire organization right didn't even

517
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
need to get

518
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,039
get past our you know maybe sandbox or

519
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,240
antivirus you name it

520
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
additionally if staff understand have

521
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
this mindset where cyber security is

522
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,320
their job

523
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,200
they

524
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
with this informed mindset they can

525
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
actually help spot unsecure processes

526
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
and hopefully work with your team to fix

527
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
it right so if they're not scared of the

528
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,080
security operations team they'll work

529
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,039
with the security operations team to fix

530
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,480
their insecure processes right um

531
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
meaning that

532
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
let's take two organizations for example

533
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
one that isn't security aware one that

534
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
is one that isn't security aware maybe

535
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
they're sending out emails with

536
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
personally identifiable information

537
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,280
right without that's not encrypted

538
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,679
but if they find out that um that's not

539
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,440
secure there

540
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,120
a

541
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,880
non-security aware organization will

542
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,559
just try to hide that under the rug

543
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,720
they'll say okay well don't tell the

544
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
security guys they're going to make our

545
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,120
lives a lot harder right versus a

546
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
security aware organization they're

547
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
going to come to me and say hey this is

548
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
how we're currently doing the emails is

549
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,880
this secure if not how can we make this

550
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
process more secure

551
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
and hopefully if you're doing your

552
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
annual cyber security awareness training

553
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
around

554
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
shortly after the training is when most

555
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,200
staff will come to you and say hey these

556
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,120
are the processes that we have can you

557
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,080
help us secure them

558
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
we talked about reporting phishing

559
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,799
emails um and yeah last thing that i

560
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
want to mention staff are not afraid of

561
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,280
reporting security events

562
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,600
so meaning a little bit of customer

563
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,320
service goes a long way

564
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
if somebody sends you an email hey is

565
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,679
this a fish hey

566
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,559
i think i clicked a malicious link

567
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,480
as the security team you want to be very

568
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
supportive you want to thank them for

569
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
letting you know

570
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
you want to get them to the point where

571
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,240
they almost feel like well you don't

572
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,600
want them to almost feel like you want

573
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,080
them to feel like you and them are

574
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
partnering up to fix an issue it's not

575
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
security isn't coming in to fix fix

576
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,679
their mess but you they maybe made a

577
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,320
mistake and security is coming in to

578
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,600
help them

579
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,440
mitigate the risk of their mistake you

580
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
want them to feel comfortable asking

581
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
your security team you want your staff

582
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
to feel safe reaching out to

583
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,559
your security analyst or manager rather

584
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,400
than feel stressed out worried that

585
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
there's going to be consequences and

586
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
stuff like that to their job

587
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,640
so

588
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,000
a little bit again a little bit of

589
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,320
customer service goes a long way

590
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
uh to make sure that staff are not

591
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,440
afraid of reporting any security events

592
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
yeah and and you know

593
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
you know as i said this can this can be

594
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
a bit of a change for your security

595
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,200
team's mindset you know i i like to joke

596
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
that you know we used to be but we're

597
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
not the department of no

598
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,799
now we're the department of police no

599
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,880
you know and so it's going to be a

600
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
change in the mindset it's hard

601
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
sometimes for more hardcore security

602
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,880
teams um to step back from the stern

603
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
parent kind of mindset you know your

604
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
team has to view themselves as part of

605
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,440
the solution and not the arbiter of good

606
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
and bad and right or wrong and that that

607
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,000
can that can be you know a bit of their

608
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,679
own sort of security culture shift as

609
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,360
well

610
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
exactly you do not want to be known as

611
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
the office of no

612
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,679
so now let's talk now we talked about

613
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
security awareness the importance of

614
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,559
security awareness let's talk about how

615
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,320
we can implement security awareness

616
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,600
within our organizations

617
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
now

618
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,799
excuse me

619
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,880
before we get into that into details of

620
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
that we need to talk about how we can

621
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,760
make it successful and before we do that

622
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,679
we need to understand the type of

623
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,840
learning that most

624
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,000
i guess the type of learners that most

625
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
people are most users

626
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
and

627
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,159
obviously there's different

628
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,760
methodologies that you can use i

629
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
personally like to use this one because

630
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,799
it keeps it simple uh the rule of three

631
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,760
visual so we've got

632
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,640
uh staff that use visual objects like

633
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
infographics charts pictures

634
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,240
network diagrams process flows that help

635
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
people understand

636
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
then we have auditory

637
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
uh retain information through hearing

638
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,880
and speaking

639
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
we have staff that this would be stuff

640
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,600
like podcasts videos

641
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
um stuff along those lines

642
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
and lastly we have kinesthetic

643
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,480
and kinesthetic essentially likes to use

644
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
the hands-on approach to learn new

645
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,080
material we have a lot of those

646
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,799
especially in the it department in the

647
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
it area but again security awareness

648
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,080
isn't just for it it's for everyone so

649
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
it's important to understand the types

650
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,559
of learners that you have visual

651
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,880
auditory and kinesthetic in order to be

652
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
able to reach them in the most efficient

653
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,039
way

654
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
right with um and i want to talk just a

655
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,360
little bit more about this before we

656
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,840
move on with a visual learner it's

657
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,360
really um

658
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,919
a lot of the things that you can get and

659
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,480
we'll talk else there will be i think

660
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,360
some links later on but um this would be

661
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,279
stuff like

662
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,679
security awareness graphics uh maybe a

663
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
psa maybe a quick update about what's

664
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
going on in the industry right if uh for

665
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,840
example when life lobs or the cra got

666
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,279
hacked you can send

667
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,080
a little picture information a little

668
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,279
infographic about how it got hacked why

669
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,039
it got hacked and that would do that

670
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
would do a lot more for these visual

671
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,520
learners than the same information in

672
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
email format

673
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,760
right

674
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
podcast you can turn that you can turn

675
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,400
you can read out that entire infographic

676
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
and turn it into a two-minute podcast or

677
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
two-minute listening piece and now

678
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
you've hit the visual and auditory

679
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,520
learners and kinesthetic

680
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
we'll talk about that later but there's

681
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,919
a few ways that you can actually test

682
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,159
your user's security awareness with the

683
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,159
kinesthetic

684
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,159
so how do we start doing it now and

685
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,480
ideally for free

686
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,679
well

687
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,760
i have a whole bunch of tools that you

688
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,559
can

689
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,760
just to get at least the base started

690
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,960
the first tool is the fishing awareness

691
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,279
tool a fishing reporting tool so this

692
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,600
tool will allow you to monitor fishes

693
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,480
from the

694
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,360
that the organization receives so

695
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,200
you can look at the picture see at the

696
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
in your email box you would have a

697
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,480
little uh phishing alert button where if

698
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
you clicked it it would go to a special

699
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
inbox that hopefully your security team

700
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
monitors

701
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,279
next you want to find a baseline so you

702
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,840
want to send a fishing simulated fishing

703
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,960
test to see how your organization does

704
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,520
this baseline is going to be

705
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
now

706
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,960
it's okay if you get a lot of clicks

707
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
this baseline is meant to see your

708
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,919
improvement

709
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,640
not your not where you're at right now

710
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,320
going forward you'll be doing different

711
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
baseline tests to ensure that you've

712
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,960
improved but even if your first one has

713
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
a really high click rate don't feel

714
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
discouraged

715
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
then you want to run monthly bi-monthly

716
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,360
quarterly whatever your organization

717
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,679
size whatever works but you want to

718
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,400
create fishing campaigns so fishing

719
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,480
campaigns essentially is a fake fish

720
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,279
that you send out on your organization's

721
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,480
behalf to actually see how well your

722
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,559
staff would have caught it or

723
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,159
fell for it

724
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,000
now

725
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,760
going back one step

726
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
for a phishing reporting tool there's a

727
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,640
free one called know before

728
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,200
they have a free

729
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
add-on you can install that sends that

730
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,880
to a phishing

731
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,640
inbox

732
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
for the baseline and running bi-monthly

733
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,960
phishing campaigns i suggest using trend

734
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,919
micro

735
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,799
so trend micro fish insights i believe

736
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
uh i believe that's the full name

737
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,480
it'll allow you to actually do free

738
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
security awareness training

739
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,120
for up to 200 users so when i started

740
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
when i say free training i mean free uh

741
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,080
phishing training so you will be able to

742
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,480
fish up to 200 users on a monthly basis

743
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,679
and they actually have some great

744
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,520
templates you can use that's a great

745
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
place to start

746
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,600
then you can move on to spear fishing so

747
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
pretend you are your department head

748
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,919
right

749
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,320
if you're fishing the it team you take

750
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,159
the it director's email and pretend to

751
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,600
be the i.t director and see the

752
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
difference between

753
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,919
the fishing the clicks there and the

754
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
general fishes

755
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
and then ideally you're looking for

756
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,399
patterns you're validating your results

757
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,080
and you're creating harder fishes as you

758
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,480
go because what you want is your goal

759
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,360
isn't to trick your staff

760
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,760
your goal is to educate them and what's

761
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120
the difference well the difference is

762
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
when you're tricking your staff there's

763
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
a whole bunch of sneaky things you can

764
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
you can throw in right you know there's

765
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
a once in a million once in a lifetime

766
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
fish that you'll get that's probably

767
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,520
undetectable to most people but

768
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,080
99 99.9 of fishes all have very common

769
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
um indicators

770
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,679
and what you need to do is you want to

771
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,600
get your staff to be as comfortable with

772
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,760
those indicators as possible so that

773
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,720
they don't get phished by that 99.99

774
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,360
of phishing emails right such as hover

775
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,240
over the hyperlink check who it's from

776
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,000
right what's the tone of the message

777
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,840
right stuff like that

778
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
excuse me and the last thing i want to

779
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,640
talk about here under awareness is your

780
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
cyber security and awareness

781
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
presentation

782
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,720
this should be a yearly thing on

783
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,039
onboardings as well as something on

784
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,799
multiple fails and phishing tests so if

785
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,320
you have someone that failed three tests

786
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,159
in one year maybe you want to send them

787
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,880
to some training

788
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,640
and here's a little example program

789
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
that you can take a look at that's a

790
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,919
great way to start

791
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,360
as you know

792
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,039
for an smb it's a great way to get your

793
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,520
feet wet when it comes to

794
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,840
a security program

795
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,480
you start wounds with

796
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
uh the

797
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,799
seminars and you're doing quarterly fit

798
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,120
with your test

799
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
i forgot to mention this testing so the

800
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,760
fishing campaign testing

801
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,240
that best way for kinesthetic learners

802
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,120
to learn and i have a slide about that

803
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
and just actually it's the next one but

804
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,919
finishing with this slide

805
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,679
you start with the greens once you're

806
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,600
happy with that you move and add yellow

807
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,360
to it so now you're

808
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,679
fishing on a bi-monthly as well as

809
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,919
you've added a lunch and learn and in

810
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,360
october cyber security awareness month

811
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
and then once you get to red now you're

812
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
doing monthly fishing campaigns you're

813
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,320
also adding in quarterly infographics

814
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
you're doing spear phishing

815
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,880
and you're doing cyber security month in

816
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,279
october

817
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,480
so this

818
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,320
is a great way to

819
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
build out your smb to at least start

820
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,440
doing

821
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,039
start creating a security awareness

822
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,279
program

823
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,240
so phishing tests i did mention we're

824
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,840
not trying to trick we're trying to

825
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,279
educate so it's very important to have a

826
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,960
oops page

827
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,799
once you've clicked the link where does

828
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,240
it take the staff

829
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,919
and how are you going to inform the

830
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,720
staff of how not to click the link going

831
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,080
forward

832
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,440
so in this case

833
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
this is a template from know before

834
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,039
however you can also just do this in

835
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,200
microsoft paint with some little text

836
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
boxes if you need to that's what i used

837
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
to do before but essentially what you

838
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
want to do is you want to highlight all

839
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
the different areas that the user could

840
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
have looked at in order to have not

841
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
gotten phished so they can learn that

842
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
next time

843
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,399
and it always it's nice to have a little

844
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,960
tagline ours is when in doubt fish it

845
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
out easy to remember

846
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,760
and we keep repeating it

847
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
so let's bring it all together how does

848
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,240
a security awareness program look well

849
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
it has yearly and awareness training

850
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,760
where we educate users on policies and

851
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,120
why

852
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,679
and this usually is our auditory and

853
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,360
visual training

854
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
then we've got our monthly phishing

855
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,519
campaigns and our goal is to educate not

856
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,640
to trick

857
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
this can be done this is a kinesthetic

858
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,559
learning type and we can do this for

859
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,279
free from fish

860
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,519
trend micro

861
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,799
then we also want to be adding

862
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,039
supplementary supplementary contact

863
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,840
content infographics webinars psa

864
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
whenever you have a great idea or you

865
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,840
think your organization maybe even lunch

866
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,199
and learns right um

867
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,640
if you have

868
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,519
any other content ideas just remember

869
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,360
about the auditory visual and

870
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
kinesthetic right you want to have a mix

871
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
of all three if you're doing a whole

872
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,559
bunch of infographics maybe you want to

873
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,200
go for a podcast or a lunch and learn

874
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,399
right

875
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,320
uh and the last thing is cyber security

876
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
month and cyber security month is a

877
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,399
well-known month for the entire industry

878
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,799
this is usually more

879
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,760
common for smbs not necessarily larger

880
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
organizations and i'll let penny explain

881
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,480
why afterwards um but essentially with a

882
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,760
cyber security month um you are aiming

883
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,200
to actually do a little bit of

884
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,159
everything

885
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,519
and try to

886
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,799
get staff to

887
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
almost it's essentially a campaign it's

888
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,799
a marketing campaign so this is your

889
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,799
thinking like marketing here where this

890
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,559
is a full month dedicated to cyber

891
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
security maybe you download a theme from

892
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,640
a security awareness provider like

893
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,399
infosec institute

894
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,600
these can be online for free

895
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,679
you can find these online for free

896
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,519
you also want to have a lunch and learn

897
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,960
where you can present a trending

898
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
security topic and provide some

899
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,559
information in october it's a great

900
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,880
month to prevent a topic around the

901
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,760
lines of uh when

902
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,559
how to stay safe shopping online you can

903
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,880
also run a contest so that way you get

904
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,679
more people fishing your fishes

905
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,840
yeah using your fish report on your

906
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
phishing email you know if there's a

907
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,159
chance they can win some money

908
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,720
make it personal don't only repeat your

909
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,559
policy

910
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,360
for

911
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,399
lunch

912
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,360
uh

913
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
that it's about

914
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
um

915
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
make sure that it's about keeping

916
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
yourself safe online other than just the

917
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,000
corporate organization because if people

918
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
are thinking of their cyber security at

919
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,960
home probably take well

920
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,559
and lastly you want to inform them the

921
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,880
progress you want to let staff know of

922
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,799
the collective improvement and then

923
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,919
penny can you

924
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,799
just give us a second why this might not

925
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,440
scale well in a larger organization

926
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,720
specifically the public security

927
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,559
um yeah so it's because you know i mean

928
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,240
i work at fraser health and as you might

929
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,519
know there's there's a month for

930
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,440
everything right there's a month but

931
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,519
cancer and and and they're all equally

932
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,559
well they're all very important um so

933
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,720
it's you know it's just a situation

934
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,880
where that kind of theme doesn't doesn't

935
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,960
work and sometimes in large orgs again

936
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,559
there's there's a whole lot of competing

937
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,200
priorities but in many situations it's a

938
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,880
great thing that you know isn't there's

939
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
often a lot of material out there

940
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
already for you to use but but yeah

941
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,079
sometimes in larger words you just have

942
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,599
to get a little a little more creative

943
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,040
because um

944
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
you know just because of the size of the

945
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,079
organ the formality of the processes

946
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,199
thank you

947
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,839
um and the last thing that i want to

948
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,000
bring it up for creating the security

949
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,679
awareness program before i hand it off

950
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,719
to penny here is remember that first um

951
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,879
slide that we looked at about what the

952
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,000
government of bc considers a security

953
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,399
awareness program well

954
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,839
if we create that docu if we

955
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,480
document it formalize that policy and

956
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,719
make sure that it's updated regularly we

957
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,800
got that

958
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,399
annual information security for

959
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,239
employees we do that annual awareness

960
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,719
training we hit the second point

961
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,399
we make sure our annual awareness

962
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,359
training

963
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,440
has all the things that the government

964
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,839
wants or other potential compliancy

965
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,280
standards we're good there too

966
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,760
we tailor the employee tailored for the

967
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,839
employees roles such as more in-depth

968
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,079
training for it admins

969
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,560
now we get a check mark there and at the

970
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
end of their session at the end of the

971
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
yearly awareness training we get their

972
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,640
signature to get the annual sign off and

973
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,480
now we've essentially created a security

974
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
awareness program that fits the goals of

975
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,599
our own government as well as most

976
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
compliancy programs security compliancy

977
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,720
programs that are out there specifically

978
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,800
now once you've done this what are the

979
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
next steps and that's where penny will

980
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
take over here

981
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
yeah so thanks anthony so you've got

982
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,640
your comp

983
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,920
and has given a great comprehensive

984
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,480
overview of all the parts of a program

985
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,079
and sort of what you need to do to be in

986
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,160
compliance with them with most of those

987
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,560
um um frameworks now i'm going to

988
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
present some thoughts on how you can

989
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,839
take that up a level or two in it it

990
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,119
could be because you've already got the

991
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,800
basics and you want to take the next

992
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
step or because you're maybe in a really

993
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,240
big organ you kind of really need to

994
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,800
scale it up so um

995
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
excuse me i'm getting over a bit of a

996
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
respiratory so i'm drinking and coughing

997
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,720
a lot my apologies so

998
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,560
um either way fully mature program has

999
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,520
four parts so formal customizable

1000
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,400
training

1001
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,040
ongoing dynamic fish training

1002
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,359
various and varied outreach

1003
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,520
and a formal managed and up-to-date

1004
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,160
themed caler calendar of events and a

1005
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,680
lot of the all of those are things that

1006
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,079
anthony sort of already um already

1007
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,240
talked about so uh next slide let's

1008
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,720
start with formal training

1009
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,800
um sorry all right

1010
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,560
here we go

1011
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,800
we're a team here um so this is what

1012
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,160
most when you say security awareness and

1013
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,680
training this is what most people think

1014
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,480
of right it's the the the

1015
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
the meat of the meat and potatoes but

1016
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
this is actually the scaffolding of the

1017
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
whole program it's not the whole meal

1018
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,119
deal

1019
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,880
there's a couple parts of it so everyone

1020
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,800
needs some sort of introduction to your

1021
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,320
organization's security during

1022
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,280
onboarding right honestly

1023
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,119
mature program would have that actually

1024
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,800
quite basic because you're going to also

1025
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,160
have ongoing training where you can

1026
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,680
flesh things out where it's going to be

1027
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,440
more relevant but we'll talk about that

1028
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
in a minute um two key things to think

1029
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
about in your onboarding

1030
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,440
can you pre-test the person to determine

1031
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,960
what training they need to meet your

1032
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
onboarding requirements can they just

1033
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,480
challenge the quiz why should a brand

1034
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,880
new security analyst have to answer all

1035
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
six modules of the basic cyber safe

1036
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,720
training right um some platforms do have

1037
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,880
that uh and i will tell you in a mature

1038
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
program it's a really good idea to build

1039
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,320
goodwill onboarding training can be

1040
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,400
really long and boring so reductions

1041
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
wherever possible can help

1042
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,599
and secondly and this is you know

1043
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,119
similar to what anthony's talked about a

1044
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,800
program in general an intern doing

1045
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
research needs uh doing internet

1046
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
research needs really different

1047
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,000
onboarding than a volunteer greeter

1048
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,920
right then the developer the cfo and

1049
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,680
your tool should allow you to create

1050
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
groups and this is often done through 80

1051
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,160
integration and in more mature platforms

1052
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
so that you can choose the relevant

1053
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
modules for you know the specific job

1054
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,839
roles and again i can't emphasize enough

1055
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,440
how important this is in generating

1056
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
goodwill people that way don't feel like

1057
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,720
they're standing there wasting their

1058
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,640
time reading a clean desk policy when

1059
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,000
they don't their job doesn't actually

1060
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,760
have a desk right

1061
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
um for your ongoing training you know

1062
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
and and the in its in its in its

1063
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
functional form that's yearly training a

1064
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,200
presentation a course or a program when

1065
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,359
you're getting to a mature system for

1066
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,599
your ongoing training you know most

1067
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,960
people assume okay every year they'll

1068
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,359
just do the same the same modules well

1069
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,280
you know that's can be really boring and

1070
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
it can actually be kind of pointless

1071
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,880
because as anthony said people will find

1072
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,640
a way to invest as little as possible

1073
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,480
and try and they'll defeat

1074
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
excuse me that'll defeat the purpose of

1075
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,599
it you'll get your checkbox for your

1076
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,839
compliance but compliance checkboxes are

1077
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,280
only part of what keeps security

1078
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,040
professionals up at night right it's the

1079
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,720
actual fact that they need the training

1080
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
as anthony said

1081
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,960
so far better is what i call drip

1082
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,000
training now i don't know if that's an

1083
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,839
injured industry term

1084
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,359
i don't think i made it up but i'm

1085
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
running with it anyway so what it means

1086
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,359
is that employees on an ongoing basis

1087
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,880
they do their on-boarding ongoing

1088
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,960
they'll get an email or some prompt

1089
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
could totally be through slack or

1090
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
whatever other asynchronous um

1091
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,880
communications that that directs them to

1092
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,680
this month's training um which should be

1093
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,839
you know a three to seven minute chunk

1094
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,680
of training if you're using a sort of

1095
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,119
more formal platform most of them will

1096
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,359
have modules that are about that size

1097
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,359
and that'll be this month's module and

1098
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,160
it should tie into some other uh um to a

1099
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,599
theme or some other activities you're

1100
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,680
doing in your program um we'll talk

1101
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,320
about that in the calendar ideas so um

1102
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
and that's their task for the month and

1103
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
then next month or whatever cadence you

1104
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,960
choose look at the next installment and

1105
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,920
so throughout the period of the year um

1106
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,680
they'll have covered all of the required

1107
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,119
training if they have outstanding

1108
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,720
modules that they haven't done then

1109
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,400
those have to be finished up for their

1110
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
you know for their compliance so this

1111
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
keeps it interesting they can do the

1112
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,599
courses at their leisure or all at once

1113
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,200
just gives people a lot of flexibility

1114
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
and gives you org flexibility if you

1115
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,079
have people in really different you know

1116
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,800
job roles so um also in more mature

1117
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,720
organizations how do you enforce this

1118
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,040
well as i said you've got your executive

1119
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,720
approved security awareness and training

1120
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,079
policy uh which says you know the d some

1121
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,440
training will be done on onboarding

1122
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,680
you'll have exec buy-in specifically

1123
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,359
you'll have exact buy-in that the

1124
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,599
completion be tracked and reported and

1125
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,599
again most platforms will allow you

1126
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,040
especially if you have like ad

1127
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
integration to be able to track and

1128
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,680
report back but it also needs to be tied

1129
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,119
back into your year-end performance

1130
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,119
reviews right i have to have my fire

1131
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,040
safety training done i also have to have

1132
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,800
my security training done before the end

1133
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
of my review year and that's that's you

1134
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
know one of the the the most common so

1135
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,800
many other training uh things that are

1136
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,720
tied into that let's use the same thing

1137
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,760
for our security training lastly you

1138
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,839
have a plan for the training but if you

1139
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,119
just have an event where somebody goes

1140
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,280
and plugs in a usb stick and and your

1141
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
you know your security team spends three

1142
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
days cleaning up malware

1143
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,160
your program needs to be able to respond

1144
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
to that you need to be able to pull that

1145
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,280
in you need to have some stuff in

1146
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,520
reserve about usb so you can put it out

1147
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,599
there with that month's batch training

1148
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,560
because

1149
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,319
everything's context dependent and you

1150
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,000
know as anthony said there's different

1151
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,280
kinds of learners that sort of

1152
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,880
experiential learner of like oh my

1153
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
goodness i remember so and so that

1154
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,319
happened right that makes it a lot more

1155
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,599
current and you do need to be able to

1156
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,280
respond to that because that's going to

1157
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,119
just make it all that much more real for

1158
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,520
um for all for for for everyone and make

1159
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
them to see a little bit more value so

1160
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,000
um okay so you got your formal training

1161
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,200
set up now you're going to look into

1162
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
maturing your uh your fish training so

1163
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,960
next slide

1164
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,200
um

1165
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,280
one of the elements of a fully mature

1166
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,520
program is and anthony alluded to this

1167
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,760
even sort of in the the initials is it's

1168
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,079
potentially asynchronous especially if

1169
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
you're a larger divorce organization

1170
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
right you need to be able to send

1171
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,359
potentially different fishes to

1172
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,440
different groups but also your platform

1173
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,040
needs to be able to create dynamic

1174
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,920
groups based on responses to fishing so

1175
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,800
you need to if a group fails a fish test

1176
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,560
you need to be able to resend a fish

1177
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,880
test to that group without in larger

1178
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,720
orgs you can't do that manually you have

1179
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,319
to be able to say okay everyone who

1180
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,960
failed this make a make a

1181
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,040
a group and we're going to resend um a

1182
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,319
fish to them

1183
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,960
um then you should if you can you know

1184
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,280
that dynamic grouping you can then if

1185
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,200
those of that group that pass you can

1186
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
generate a lot of goodwill by sending

1187
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,560
them an email saying hey did you know we

1188
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,040
sent you another fish and you caught it

1189
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,800
so congratulations and that can generate

1190
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,319
a lot of good will because people often

1191
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,960
have a lot of baggage um when they fail

1192
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,480
and then again it will also allow you

1193
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,319
especially if your fish training and

1194
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,400
your security training are tied in you

1195
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,319
can actually take create a group from

1196
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,000
that of the people who failed the second

1197
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,760
time and direct them specifically

1198
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,160
towards some training as well um but

1199
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,760
these groups need to be able to be

1200
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,359
dynamically frasier all three of forty

1201
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,880
thousand people i can't you know my team

1202
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,319
can't be manually sort of you know

1203
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,240
managing these things and then your

1204
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
decisions need to be data driven you

1205
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,680
need to see if your training is working

1206
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,160
you need to know if groups maybe certain

1207
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,480
groups are more f vulnerable to fish

1208
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
certain kinds of fishes

1209
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,400
on the night shifts right that's really

1210
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,760
really relevant when you have a large

1211
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,440
org you have to start focusing in on

1212
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,520
those those kinds of things so and it

1213
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,880
means your reporting will change over

1214
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,440
time as well some platforms have robust

1215
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,280
reporting um

1216
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,040
but sometimes you also have to export it

1217
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,480
depending on what other attributes you

1218
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
want but um you know that is going to

1219
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,319
have to change over time because your

1220
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,400
executive are going to get more mature

1221
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,079
in the in in the detail that they want

1222
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,480
to see as well so okay so you've got

1223
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,800
phishing and training maturing as we go

1224
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,520
what are some other uh tools that we can

1225
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
that we can use so there's lots of

1226
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,520
options but the key

1227
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,280
keys are to make sure first of all that

1228
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,720
they're custom

1229
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,640
you need to hack whatever you see and

1230
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,319
make sure it works in your org so

1231
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,040
anything that you see in a book or on

1232
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,839
slides um you need to you need to use

1233
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,520
that as a placeholder for what you're

1234
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
going to develop right you can't can't

1235
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,599
just parrot stuff across and in the same

1236
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,359
vein it has to be authentic it looks

1237
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,800
like you're just replacing stuff from

1238
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,960
microsoft's website or re-running it or

1239
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,040
running a canned webinar

1240
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,640
your staff aren't going to be impressed

1241
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,920
and they're not going to be engaged

1242
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,000
right all of this has to provide them

1243
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,359
some value

1244
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,119
phishing training they're obliged to do

1245
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,480
that attending your programs

1246
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,560
participating in your context and all

1247
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,839
that has to provide them with something

1248
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,920
tangible or they simply won't engage

1249
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
right really useful actionable

1250
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,839
information hey here's about password

1251
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,240
managers that's a um you know the sort

1252
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,280
of thing

1253
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,119
swag from swag is also something that

1254
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,760
you can provide them we're human right

1255
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,079
um and fraser we have these cool mugs

1256
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,760
that say passwords are like coffee not

1257
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,319
for sharing we also have we have socks

1258
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,160
that say socks are like passwords you

1259
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,599
always need more than one

1260
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,040
um yeah we're just totally going with

1261
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,640
the sort of cheesy nerd nerd line so and

1262
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,240
and to give away i have a little stack

1263
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,560
of tiny notepads that say don't write

1264
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,280
your password here um to which my adult

1265
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,560
children i always forget the password

1266
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,480
for our wi-fi um and then when guests

1267
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,800
come i have to ask them so they actually

1268
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
took one of these wrote our wi-fi

1269
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
password and then laminated it and

1270
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,599
that's what i have to hand to to staff

1271
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,800
so i don't know why other people take me

1272
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,880
seriously because my children evidently

1273
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,920
don't but anyway that's an aside um

1274
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,920
security champions this is one of my

1275
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,680
favorites it's it's it's it's great but

1276
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,200
you have to have a formal program for

1277
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,440
this you can't wing it right

1278
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,880
the security team because it's

1279
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,400
complicated they have to get something

1280
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,160
from you more training swag kudos and

1281
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,920
there's and we have to get something

1282
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,839
from them they have to get our messages

1283
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,000
out to the teams but there's another

1284
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,520
sort of element of the the two-way

1285
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,200
street that we we need they have to um

1286
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,079
um

1287
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,839
bring information back to us so that we

1288
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,920
better understand what their segment of

1289
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,400
the organization needs so wow those

1290
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,839
those you know those mugs are great but

1291
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,599
they're really heavy for kids if that's

1292
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,280
relevant or wow everyone really

1293
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,440
appreciated that email last night but

1294
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,800
the night shift kind of didn't

1295
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,000
understand it because it's really not

1296
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,640
relevant to their to their work or hey

1297
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,319
that article on password managers that

1298
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,560
was it's great for most of us but any a

1299
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,960
lot of our esc esl people struggled to

1300
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,640
understand it so we might just want to

1301
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,400
you know rephrase that a little bit

1302
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,480
we need our ambassadors champions

1303
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,560
whatever you call them to help us change

1304
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,640
our security to help us change security

1305
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,599
culture

1306
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,040
but they also need to bring things back

1307
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,359
to help us change our security program

1308
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,280
and that's a you know that's why

1309
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,200
it it there's lots of resources out

1310
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,119
there in security champions programs i

1311
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,119
won't even begin to to you know most of

1312
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,640
mine is anecdotal um

1313
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,800
but so i won't go into too much detail

1314
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,720
here but remember it can be a really fun

1315
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
and rewarding part so don't leave it out

1316
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,160
but it can't be your first step because

1317
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,839
it's it's not as simple as it seems so

1318
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,240
um one of the other things content right

1319
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,400
if you have a website that um has

1320
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,079
constantly changing content that's

1321
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,760
relevant that's another thing that you

1322
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
can use to drive engagement if you have

1323
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,520
an internal

1324
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,760
internal comms or internet team you

1325
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,440
actually want to use all the tricks from

1326
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,760
from your internet group because you

1327
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,960
know you want to you want to make sure

1328
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,040
it's new content from a security

1329
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,319
perspective

1330
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,000
you have to make sure that there's no

1331
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,680
stale content and there cannot be

1332
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,240
incorrect content or out of date content

1333
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
or you'll lose all credibility so but

1334
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,920
that's uh you know that's that's another

1335
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,720
one

1336
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,920
one day i'll have to do a whole session

1337
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,680
on different outreach options

1338
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,599
but uh you know for now

1339
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,040
you know there's there's there's

1340
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,560
actually there's often a lot of talks

1341
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,680
about this sort of thing a lot of

1342
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,520
conferences um

1343
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,880
one suggestion i can say is if you're

1344
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,160
large enough or to have a marketing

1345
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,079
department and anthony alluded to this

1346
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,520
talk to your marketing department

1347
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,440
because they're used to marketing

1348
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,280
outside ask them to work with you to

1349
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,359
market inside right

1350
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,160
and um and they actually find it quite

1351
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,839
quite interesting so one of the things

1352
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,599
they will tell you to probably create as

1353
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,520
will your internet team is to create a

1354
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,800
calendar

1355
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,839
um so for the next slide um this is

1356
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,720
where you set a theme for each cadence

1357
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,960
right um you match up your articles your

1358
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,880
blogs your training

1359
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,720
and and then you sort of you're planning

1360
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,839
ahead so what what i've done is here's

1361
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,599
all the difference we have um you know

1362
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,400
our overall theme and then we have um

1363
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
our blog and we have our webinar and we

1364
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,440
have our email tagline and we have what

1365
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,040
what outreach are we doing what what

1366
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,559
training are we giving to specific

1367
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,680
groups

1368
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,520
and then that way for each month you can

1369
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,880
just figure out everything that's

1370
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,520
relevant for that month um

1371
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,119
and base it back to the theme so it just

1372
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,800
allows you to plan

1373
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
um plan ahead and it gives you a

1374
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,040
structure i also have categories for my

1375
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
articles like

1376
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,839
definitions uh real life which is you

1377
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,760
know what's it like in our org in

1378
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,800
general and i every now and then i just

1379
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
make up a bunch of topics

1380
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,119
fit them into those uh categories and

1381
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,359
then in my calendar i alternate between

1382
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,280
the three categories so all i have to do

1383
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,119
is find a definitions topic that's about

1384
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,880
frontline workers and boom i have my

1385
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,119
topic for the for the for the time so

1386
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,000
it's just a kind of a way to to to hack

1387
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,160
what can be a really over a really large

1388
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,839
um issue so

1389
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,960
um

1390
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,079
and you know when you have all this it

1391
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,680
doesn't look like it's you know done by

1392
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,040
frantically understaffed security

1393
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,319
analysts so

1394
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,240
next slide

1395
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,559
so that the elephant that's in the room

1396
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,880
is that a lot of this can actually be

1397
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
leading horses to water like like we

1398
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,720
talked about right all this effort can

1399
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,240
make them aware

1400
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,760
and we talked about awareness of the

1401
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,680
issues but also awareness of the power

1402
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,000
that they have that your users have to

1403
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,839
protect against the issues but it's not

1404
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,200
actually going to make him care unless

1405
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,119
you have that as a central tenant of

1406
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,280
your program right i'm aware that

1407
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,839
jaywalking is a crime right but if i

1408
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,839
think the road looks clear

1409
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,599
i don't care about i'll do it because

1410
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,119
there's really no consequence unless i

1411
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,280
get caught and i don't see any cups but

1412
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,960
if i see a little kid

1413
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,119
right i'm often not going to jaywalk

1414
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,720
because there's a real reason not to

1415
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
that kid could copy me and run out you

1416
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,359
know so suddenly i care about that

1417
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:42,960
because there's a relevance to me and

1418
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,880
and so i'm going to make better choices

1419
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,760
right

1420
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,480
so what can i do to protect my my

1421
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,720
organization which is everyone around me

1422
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,880
as well as myself but then the next step

1423
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,480
is can they actually do that

1424
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,280
just because they are aware and then

1425
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,200
they care are they in a position to

1426
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,839
always make the right choice so it means

1427
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,839
this means embedding security in the way

1428
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,440
we approach a lot of things for instance

1429
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,000
your dlp stops them from sending certain

1430
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,520
files by email great

1431
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,760
but you also at that point have to make

1432
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,079
sure that they're then informed how to

1433
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,920
send those files safely right because

1434
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,000
when was the last time if ever that that

1435
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,760
information was presented to them maybe

1436
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,079
at their onboarding a year ago it's not

1437
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,640
going to pop into mind so can we have

1438
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
that info be part of the message that

1439
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,240
tells them they're not allowed to do

1440
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,480
that right the organization does not

1441
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,319
allow this to happen

1442
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,960
here's where how you can send files

1443
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,400
it has to be pretend

1444
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,119
presented in context and yeah you go to

1445
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,920
that's a very specific ask to your i.t

1446
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,440
department right

1447
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,200
and that is the key to the cultural

1448
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,160
shift that's the key to a real cyber

1449
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,640
safe security culture it's that second

1450
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,440
order effect right your ip department

1451
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,680
has to be invested in security like the

1452
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,280
average user

1453
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,200
but also

1454
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,680
in the implementation of their work

1455
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,200
so they're not just worried about them

1456
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,920
not clicking on usbs but they're also

1457
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,839
going to hear your requests and go oh

1458
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,920
wow yeah that makes total sense we need

1459
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
to do that because that's going to make

1460
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,720
um

1461
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,480
everything that much more that much more

1462
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,599
secure

1463
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,839
um

1464
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,559
so

1465
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,839
we have to get

1466
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,200
and that's what i mean by that second

1467
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,720
order effect everyone has to care

1468
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,960
everyone has to has to has to be making

1469
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,000
the right choices but the whole

1470
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,160
organization also has to be working to

1471
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,559
make sure that people can make the right

1472
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,119
choice when they are because as we know

1473
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,880
at the coalface

1474
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,079
um it's all about friction

1475
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,040
so people will take the easiest path

1476
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,160
next slide

1477
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,280
and we will and people doing will be

1478
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,839
doing their job

1479
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,119
they're going to do it they need to do

1480
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,520
their job right and to do their job

1481
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,280
faster and better and that statement

1482
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,680
that's benign not uh not critical in any

1483
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,319
way because you know i i j walk but

1484
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,000
it's critical to creating that cyber

1485
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,839
safe culture it's not just those first

1486
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,240
order things like people using safe file

1487
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,640
transfer methods but also needing to

1488
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,319
permeate the culture so we don't you

1489
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,839
know we don't do things like this we

1490
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,319
can't just have security saying not

1491
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,160
allowing people to do things we need to

1492
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,559
be creating an environment where making

1493
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,640
the right choice is the easier choice to

1494
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,720
make so that we don't end up with things

1495
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,160
like this

1496
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,240
picture on the screen

1497
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,040
so that's it

1498
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,000

1499
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,280
awesome thanks penny all right so now i

1500
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
know we do have some questions let me

1501
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,520
just get out of the screen here

1502
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,440
um and we'll see what we can answer here

1503
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,160
okay

1504
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,279
yeah just looking at the

1505
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,960
well apparently we should probably

1506
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,480
apparently we should give a lot of food

1507
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,960
as well apparently food's a good choice

1508
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,359
yes it is

1509
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,800
um

1510
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,319
yes so just one question i wanted to

1511
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,599
answer quickly just because i know that

1512
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,839
one will be easy to answer uh would it

1513
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,280
be possible to get a copy of these

1514
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,920
slides to refer back to later

1515
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,040
um

1516
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,280
feel free to reach out to myself on

1517
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,680
linkedin if you want an actual copy of

1518
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,800
them however this event will is recorded

1519
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,720
and will be posted on youtube so you

1520
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,040
will be able to reference this whenever

1521
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,400
you'd like

1522
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,319
anthony can i answer one question here

1523
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,720
or one comment here so i see a couple of

1524
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,800
times people have said you know security

1525
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,319
is not everyone's job unfortunately i

1526
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,480
didn't get a chance to watch that but

1527
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,359
yes

1528
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,800
and then more

1529
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,000
sort of the next level of some of the

1530
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,160
conversations i was having is that you

1531
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,240
as a security team and as but not even

1532
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,640
as a security team as an organization

1533
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,440
if you can make do the thing so that the

1534
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,319
user never has to be given the choice

1535
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,880
absolutely that's the next step to take

1536
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,520
right so if we can make it so that if

1537
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,760
they try to put the email it's stuff in

1538
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,200
their email

1539
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,119
it routes it through

1540
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,880
it routes it securely and then it's not

1541
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,960
an issue absolutely we want to get there

1542
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,440
but we're not there yet um and not

1543
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,440
everything can be can be done that way

1544
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,200
so i totally agree and i will go back

1545
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,680
and watch the that presentation but

1546
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,920
that's in many cases a level of maturity

1547
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,520
that i think a lot of organizations

1548
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,880
aren't necessarily at yet so

1549
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,720
agreed

1550
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,280
um yeah we haven't had a chance to look

1551
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,200
at all the questions as we were speaking

1552
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,599
um another question we have and this

1553
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,119
one's probably closer for penny um in a

1554
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,280
security awareness program say for two

1555
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,040
to three years we developed and given

1556
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
training on

1557
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,240
various topics like phishing malware

1558
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,000
passwords especially for existing

1559
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
non-technical people how do we make it

1560
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
more interesting after two to three

1561
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,640
years because existing staff would have

1562
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,480
gained information about common

1563
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,839
awareness topics

1564
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,640
yeah you know what i would i

1565
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,040
if you don't have a um a champions

1566
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,880
program i would say that's definitely an

1567
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,960
opportunity to get some of your security

1568
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,400
champions to

1569
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,240
design some training that's a little bit

1570
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,200
more um um

1571
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,280
really focused on on sort of what

1572
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,880
they've learned as they've as they've

1573
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,160
gone along

1574
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,400
that i think just ties back into needing

1575
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,319
to make it um

1576
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,720
constantly updating it as well

1577
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,319
um and and um you know

1578
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,920
uh you know develop again i don't know

1579
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,760
what your budget is but develop some

1580
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,760
contests or you know um um

1581
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,119
[Music]

1582
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,280
treasure hunts whatever where they where

1583
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,480
all of the things that they need to

1584
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,920
learn about passwords they have to

1585
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,440
actually put into practice in certain

1586
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,400
environments so there's some you know

1587
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,960
lots lots of things but it all just ties

1588
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,319
back to that thing of having to just be

1589
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,240
changing it up every year and maybe

1590
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,400
maybe having one stream for the newer

1591
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,440
people and another stream for or

1592
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,799
for the more people have been there

1593
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,839
longer maybe where they can just even um

1594
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,280
challenge the quiz and not necessarily

1595
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,799
have to have to do the training so

1596
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,240
i think we might be at our time yeah uh

1597
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,559
do i think we are

1598
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,880
moving to another session task to answer

1599
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,640
more questions

1600
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,839
uh

1601
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,880
ashley just want to confirm

1602
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,799
because i know another speaker is coming

1603
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,759
on in just a minute here

1604
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,839
all right i think in that case um we'll

1605
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,559
just have the next speaker hop on

1606
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,200
um if you have any questions absolutely

1607
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,440
feel free to reach out to either of us

1608
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,240
on linkedin um probably an easier way to

1609
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
get in chat with us to get in touch with

1610
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,280
us

1611
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
and from there i guess we'll pass it on

1612
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,240
to your next presenter here
