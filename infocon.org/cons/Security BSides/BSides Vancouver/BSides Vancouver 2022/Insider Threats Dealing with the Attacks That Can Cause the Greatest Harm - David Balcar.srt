1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
forensics i'm usually the guy brought in

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,799
to break all the things uh i'm pretty

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,319
good at that i love everything from

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,559
social engineering to you know getting

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,280
into different kind of networks so i've

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,799
actually done a lot of cases and i'm

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,160
going to talk about one of my cases that

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,440
i've worked with law enforcement and

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
stuff over the years uh and with insider

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
threats uh you get can you got my

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,600

so i always like talking about the

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
threat landscape a little bit um i wish

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,399
we had bulb blart to uh help us when we

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,399
need help but you know the threat

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,640
landscape out there is you know crazy so

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,879
when we see stuff like this right so

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,879
here's a hotel i was given a talk a

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,120
couple years ago and

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
they the manager made a point to me when

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,600
i checked in and saying hey you have a

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,920
card and be sure to use that card to get

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
to your floor i was like oh okay they

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
got decent security and i get into the

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
elevator and guess what i see i see a

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,000
permanent card attached to the

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
elevator door here and of course being

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
who i am i definitely had to try it and

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
of course i could get to any floor that

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
i want it uh being a magnetic card gonna

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
be really easy to clone um i actually

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
didn't have a cloner that day but if i

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,799
did it would have been really really

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
easy to to clone that for sure

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
um you definitely don't want to uh this

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
is the insider

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
blocking their boss from seeing what

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,400
they want to do

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,439
for sure

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,400
um i know we've all heard of byod this

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
is byofs this is bring your own fire

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
extinguisher uh probably don't want to

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,799
be in this building uh when this goes

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,280
off for sure and how did the the guy

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,119
putting the railing there

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
actually say you know what this is a

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,399
good idea let's block this door probably

51
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,840
probably not good

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,439
uh this is your hopefully there's no one

53
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,720
from cisco but this is your network

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
protected by cisco uh just kidding uh so

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,680
you know we've heard of you know people

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,360
propping open doors and stuff and people

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
that'll walk in a perfect example right

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,880
there

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
and then we have you know of course

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
people leave their

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,960
codes out there for everybody to get to

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
which is really really tough to see

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
and oh and just a quick one this one was

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
uh the one on the right was taken at a

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,640
security conference a couple years ago

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
uh if you can believe that

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
um definitely uh watch out for where you

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
charge your cell phone um and and who's

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
actually providing that electricity or

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
electrons going through that you never

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
know who the insider is

72
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
so what does wikipedia say what is the

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
insider threat right it is that

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,239
malicious threat to any organization it

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
could be employees foreign employees

76
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
contractors business associates uh you

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
know contractors that are out you know

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,760
working

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,800
and

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
they've got higher access than everybody

81
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
else right they can just walk through

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
the front door which is kind of crazy

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
one of the things i like to say you know

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,160
if you ever get a chance to read the art

85
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
of war read the art of war there's a lot

86
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
of stuff in there that you can use and

87
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
day-to-day you know cyber hygiene cyber

88
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,920
security and i like this one particular

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
quote right if you know your enemy and

90
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
yourself you need not fear the result of

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,640
100 battles but if you know yourself but

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
not the enemy for every victory gain

93
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,159
will also suffer a defeat and i think

94
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
that second sentence is so true

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,239
right you've got to know who the enemy

96
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
is whether it's a nation-state attack

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,120
it's an insider threat it's it could be

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
you know what about hardware failing you

99
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,560
know i mean that's it could be a threat

100
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
as well

101
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
so i think it's it's a very good saying

102
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
uh in relation to cyber security

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
so what does hollywood say about uh

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
threats so

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,040
i'll give everybody a second to look at

106
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
this picture but it's you know what was

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
this guy doing you know what kind of

108
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
insider threat was he

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
he was doing ip theft for sure he was

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,159
trying to steal the dyno dna so to speak

111
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,599
i don't know if you watch this i know a

112
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,120
lot of people watch this

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
in the u.s for sure

114
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,959
and again thanks for everybody for

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,799
having me today in beautiful vancouver i

116
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
wish i was there i'm actually at

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,680
a race track called limerock park if you

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
want to google that in lakeview

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
connecticut today

120
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
so in mr robot he was trying to do

121
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
sabotage right he was trying to walk

122
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
knock out the building so they couldn't

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,760
restore all the data the financial data

124
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,840
then we got this guy so what do we think

125
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
this guy was doing

126
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
this guy was trying to do fraud he was

127
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,918
actually trying to do the superman three

128
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,040
fraud by every transaction siphoning off

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
like hundreds of a penny

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
and if they did it multiple transactions

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
well of course they messed up and it was

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,479
subtracting like dollars at a time of

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,160
every transaction

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,759
then we got this guy

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,240
so what do you think this guy was doing

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
well this is ed snowden so this is

137
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
actually from the movie at snowden so

138
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,840
was this guy doing espionage against the

139
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
the us government or was he a

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
whistleblower showing what was being

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,720
done uh it is very controversial even to

142
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
this day for sure uh

143
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
to even think about that so and i'll

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
talk about a case that was similar

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
um in a commercial space anyways where

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
you know was it a whistleblower wasn't

147
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,960
it a whistleblower

148
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
so i've got this picture this is a tweet

149
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,240
from a couple years ago and i always

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
find it interesting because i do a lot

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,600
of

152
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,520
like hardware hacks and own stuff and

153
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
research on reverse engineering of

154
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
different kinds of hardware and it was

155
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,520
interesting when i saw this is because

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
this was a daughter board this was in a

157
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,600
cisco switch that they sold several

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
hundred of them but if you look closely

159
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
at it that is a cyber espionage device

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
and that device was actually talking

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
back to china

162
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
for different things right and they

163
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,360
could look for anything that implant so

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
i always ask you especially if i'm there

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
live is how many people have actually

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
taken apart their equipment before they

167
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,919
put it online and very few people do

168
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,320
that right i mean i know i do uh when i

169
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
get new equipment i'm going to pull it

170
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
apart i want to see is there some kind

171
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
of implant

172
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
this implant was easy to find for sure

173
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
but there's definitely other implants

174
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,639
that are going to be very extremely

175
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,720
difficult to find now you couldn't

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
protect yourself against this if this

177
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
was in your network

178
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
it's game over so you have to be very

179
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
vigilant around supply chain and other

180
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
things and where you're getting

181
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
equipment

182
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
so some of the stuff that's in the news

183
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,759
of course this is an insider deaf data

184
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,880
theft during remote work of course that

185
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
huge during uh these last couple years

186
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
for sure

187
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
then you've got this one this in

188
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
particular insider was sentence sentence

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,440
for sabotaging ppe shipments it's like

190
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
it's not just cyber it's across the

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
board where else are these insiders

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
messing with their stuff

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
so this is a real bad one this is all

194
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,520
about banking so this is in may of last

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
year almost a year ago so the cipher was

196
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
looking for insiders at bank of america

197
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
chase bank wells fargo

198
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
they were trying to get access to

199
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
someone who

200
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
could

201
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
basically authorize transactions they

202
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
were they could hack into the banks they

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
were trying to send transactions across

204
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,639
them

205
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,199
and then they would say okay if we're

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,680
going to deal with amounts over 200 000

207
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
to several million and they would give

208
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
whoever they could get a figure eight

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
figures out weekly comp weekly

210
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
eight seven to eight figures a week uh

211
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
that they could run through there uh

212
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
crazy crazy time and they were going to

213
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
get a uh definitely a cut right 40 to 50

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
percent

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
so whoever could do that was going to

216
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
make a ton of money and definitely going

217
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
to go to jail for a very long time

218
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
so here's one this is a former i.t admin

219
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,120
i like this guy

220
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
he really was innovative this is a

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
couple several years ago

222
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,120
uh he not only did he leave a back door

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
but he accessed his company's network

224
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
over 700 times in one year which i find

225
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
you know kind of amusing because i mean

226
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
that's averaging he was connecting and

227
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
doing something on their network 2.3

228
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,280
times a day

229
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
every day for a year

230
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
i guess he didn't take off for christmas

231
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,639
in new year's or his birthday he kept

232
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,599
working

233
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
and they didn't discover him until a

234
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
year into it

235
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,440
which is kind of crazy

236
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
here's another one this is a road i.t

237
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,919
this is back in 2018. if you ever get a

238
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,120
chance to read this story it's pretty

239
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
interesting

240
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
and i like to say going off the rails

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
because it had to deal with canadian

242
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,039
train switches

243
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,879
and he was shutting them down

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
he did get a year and a day behind bars

245
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,120
for that as well

246
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
here's a story about a

247
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
terminated employee what he did was hack

248
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
his way back in and he faced and this is

249
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,120
again this is all the way back in 2009

250
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
uh he actually compromised over a

251
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,839
thousand servers uh across that network

252
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,800
so you have to be vigilant across you

253
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
know logins

254
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
data transfers you know it's a lot to

255
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
watch and we'll talk more about that in

256
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
just a little bit

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,600
so

258
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
what about this this is the easy stuff

259
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,680
right this is at an insider job at a

260
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
medical clinic they were actually taking

261
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,480
their phone and just screenshotting uh

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,200
their little ipads and their computers

263
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
because they they weren't allowed to

264
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
print they weren't allowed to do just

265
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
certain things on those computers and

266
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
then this person was selling that data

267
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
very hard to catch i mean they had they

268
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,959
actually caught up through security

269
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
cameras

270
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
um so this is always bad right this is a

271
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
couple years ago this particular

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,160
company's employee sold customer info to

273
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,920
tech support scammers so we've all seen

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
those tech support scammers but now if

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
they've got more inside information

276
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
man it makes their credible more

277
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
credible right when they call you say

278
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
hey i'm with such and such and we notice

279
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,080
that you own such and such product they

280
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
can get more specific in their phishing

281
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
attempts to try to scam you and get into

282
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,199
your computer

283
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,120
uh dlp the three-letter word uh

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,240
it's tough dlp is very tough to get

285
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,959
built correctly i would say

286
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,959
across i haven't seen a really great

287
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
install of dlp because there's just so

288
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
many ways to get around it

289
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720
you can see this particular company

290
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,959
was suing these four former employees

291
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,760
for stealing company data

292
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
and they didn't catch them with their

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
dlp they actually caught caught them

294
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
after the fact because it was a several

295
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,760
sales people that was stealing

296
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
customer information to go to a new

297
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
company

298
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,079
now here's an interesting one this is

299
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,040
when the fbi arrested a nsa contractor

300
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,079
for leaking secrets to uh the media

301
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,959
well

302
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
yeah she's all sitting here looking

303
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,560
actually getting ready to smile hey i'm

304
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
having a great day

305
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
but they actually

306
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
caught her because

307
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
she couldn't send the information and

308
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
she couldn't put it on a usb drive so

309
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
what she would do is print it and

310
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
actually walk it out the front door to

311
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
give it to the media

312
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
well once they

313
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
were on to her they actually did the

314
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
drop they grabbed the paper from her and

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
what most people don't know for a long

316
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
long time now

317
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
laser printers and stuff will print

318
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
micro dots uh in very very small

319
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,839
sections so you could actually take a

320
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,519
piece of paper and if you have a really

321
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,959
really good microscope you can actually

322
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,880
find this stuff and it's got the serial

323
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
number of the printer if it's got a date

324
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
and time it's got several metadata and

325
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
that's how they tracked her down

326
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
because they could track exactly what

327
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,680
printer it was that she was printing

328
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
from

329
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
so another one and of course you got

330
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
steve harvey looking like what happened

331
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
so this is a rogue system admin they

332
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
shut down and deletes core files on the

333
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,040
day he was fired so what do you do with

334
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,240
that do you

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
you know if you've got a rogue admin or

336
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
someone that's disgruntled employee you

337
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
know how do we prepare for that do we

338
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
have good backups do we do we have a

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,399
process in place say okay you know what

340
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
a week before you leave or two weeks

341
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
we're gonna shut your access off um you

342
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
know i know it's hard to believe someone

343
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
just walks in walks out but it's

344
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,519
definitely you've got to have some

345
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
policies and procedures and be able to

346
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
look at some of that stuff

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,200
so

348
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
a little

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
case that i worked on

350
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
several years ago this particular

351
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
insider this was at a we'll call them a

352
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
chemical company so they had and this

353
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
was multiple players multiple insider

354
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,639
threats it all started with one of their

355
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
sales people leaving

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
and wanted to go work for the competitor

357
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,839
and they these two competitors only sell

358
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,560
the same stuff you know so it's very

359
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,720
guarded secret of how they produce their

360
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,079
you know

361
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,680
chemicals and whatnot

362
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
and what was interesting though is i was

363
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
at this site doing a security audit

364
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,680
actually doing some pin testing for them

365
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
and the

366
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
i.t director came up to me and says hey

367
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
uh you know we have we have an issue

368
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,959
that we want you to look at and i said

369
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
well that's interesting i've got an

370
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
issue i need to talk to you about

371
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,079
and so he's proceeded to tell me it's

372
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
like hey we had an employee or somebody

373
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
from the outside send an email inside

374
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,040
our company with our employee list they

375
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,600
actually knew our group names

376
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
and they sent all the salary information

377
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,680
spreadsheets of every what everyone was

378
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
making and bonuses and everything to

379
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
everybody in the company so it really

380
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
caused a stir

381
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,440
uh at the same time

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,000
on one of my laptops because like when i

383
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,519
do pin testing i actually carry two

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,440
laptops one i actually set up is quote a

385
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,639
honeypot

386
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,480
just in case see what's happening on the

387
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,200
network and it kept getting scanned and

388
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
plus my main computer kept getting

389
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
scanned so we start tracing it and we

390
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,480
were in the it department uh and it was

391
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,760
actually somebody that was just two

392
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
cubicles over because we traced the wire

393
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,959
down to the wire

394
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
and they were scanning our boxes trying

395
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
to look for vulnerabilities it's like

396
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
what are they trying to do

397
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,440
and so when i approached the i.t

398
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
director about this and he goes man

399
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
that's funny

400
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
but i don't believe it's that guy

401
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
well i don't know why he would do it

402
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
he's probably just goofing around or

403
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,639
something it's probably not real it's

404
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
like okay so we proceeded to investigate

405
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
the case and of course the scans got

406
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
more and more

407
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
frequent on the boxes

408
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,199
and during our investigation

409
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
i learned that there was a laptop from

410
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,600
the sales person that we wanted to do

411
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
forensics on and so forth like that but

412
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
i had a sneaky suspicions about this

413
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,560
particular insider and

414
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
uh it admin so we actually set up a

415
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,480
little sting

416
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
their main office is 20 minutes away

417
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
from their the plant that we were at

418
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,000
and so we said hey can you please come

419
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,040
to the main the hq pick up this laptop

420
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
and bring it back so you can re-image it

421
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
what he didn't know is that we had

422
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
already forensically taken a copy of the

423
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
hard drive we took the original hard

424
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
drive out cloned it to a

425
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,399
just another hard drive put it back in

426
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,360
the machine

427
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,639
and we had a private eye along with one

428
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,959
of our other guys follow this guy out

429
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,079
and it took them over 45 minutes to make

430
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,600
that 20 minute drive

431
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
well

432
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
i got a call later that day as soon as

433
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
the guy showed up uh from rpi and stuff

434
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
and it says hey you'll never believe

435
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
this i have pictures of this guy in a

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,839
parking lot with his laptop open and

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,399
he's wiping out files and we saw all the

438
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,680
evidence because we could compare the

439
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,279
two hard drives and that's what he was

440
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
doing he was actually covering for the

441
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,120
sales guy so

442
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,360
fortunately we caught this guy we got

443
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,399
the

444
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,079
sales guy we actually worked with the

445
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,880
other

446
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
company and they said hey

447
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,680
we don't want anything any part of this

448
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,120
and we'll help you in the investigation

449
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,079
well turns out both people were caught

450
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
and it was not a good situation for

451
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
anybody and actually they went to jail

452
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
for several years for stealing

453
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
information especially you know formulas

454
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,600
and sales information everything else

455
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
uh bad bad stuff

456
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,360
so here's my wtf moment for the day so

457
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
of course you've heard this story about

458
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
anthony ledowski uh he was trying to uh

459
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,959
steal uh trade secrets from wamo and

460
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,040
give them to uber which the guy smiling

461
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,720
on the left uh which is the old ceo of

462
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,399
uber which is travis

463
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
um and it's interesting you know

464
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,199
i currently work at uh company vmware

465
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
and our software actually was the one

466
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
that was used in this it was when i was

467
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
with carbon black they bought carbon

468
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
black and

469
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,680
we could tell exactly how many files

470
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,399
were they files and what specific usb

471
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,639
drive they they stole

472
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
to store all these files and that's when

473
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,199
so when google testified in court they

474
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
testified said yep this is the software

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
we use this is how we found out and you

476
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
know and all that kind of stuff

477
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
so fast forward a little bit uh

478
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,399
so he did plea finally plead guilty to

479
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
stealing google tran uh trade secrets

480
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
and and as of a year and a half ago so

481
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
to get 30 months uh in prison for it so

482
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
not a good thing

483
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
here's my honorable mention

484
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
today for insider threat so this u.s

485
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,399
employee he actually outsourced his job

486
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,639
to china but he did it in an interesting

487
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,160
way so

488
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,759
when they worked remotely they had to

489
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,319
have rsa tokens so they you know it

490
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,839
changes the number six digit number

491
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,000
every minute and what he would do is

492
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,079
he'd get that and fedex it to somebody

493
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,199
in china

494
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,280
and they would vpn

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
and what he would do he would set their

496
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,679
watch cat videos on youtube look at ebay

497
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
read it and everything else and this

498
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,039
other guy did his job and he would just

499
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,000
pay this guy to do his job uh and he got

500
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
away with it for quite some time

501
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
just crazy crazy stuff

502
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
out there for sure

503
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
um i love this one this is my best one

504
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,480
for sure

505
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,799
uh this man hacks the jail computer

506
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,559
network to get his uh try to get his

507
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
friend released early uh when i uh made

508
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
some inquiries into this one i said why

509
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,240
didn't y'all just let him

510
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,200
uh

511
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
come pick up the guy instead of

512
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,919
arresting him so they went out and

513
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
arrested him uh this engineer that did

514
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,120
this they arrested him at his house but

515
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
i was like man i would have let him come

516
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
to the prison like pick up his friend

517
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,360
that way you can get both of them and

518
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,520
just put them both in prison

519
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,960
so yeah funny funny times

520
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
so some of the stats out there

521
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,679
that you may or may not know so insider

522
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
threats pose one of the biggest security

523
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
risks out there

524
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
so over 91 percent of i.t and security

525
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,960
professionals feel they're vulnerable

526
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,400
and i always ask i was like why do you

527
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
feel vulnerable it's like and usually

528
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
it's the visibility we don't have

529
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,919
visibility into whatever this threat

530
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,919
could be whether they're stealing data

531
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,840
they have the wrong access

532
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
you know and i'm all about you know

533
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
you've got to have that visibility

534
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,240
you've got to have that audit capability

535
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
to be able to look at not only who's

536
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
logging in so you're you can catch more

537
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
than just quote insiders right but as

538
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,120
people are trying to you know whatever

539
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,559
whatever attacker it is whether it's a

540
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,080
nation state or whatever it's going to

541
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
be doing

542
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
um you know lateral movement across the

543
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,559
network and you can catch them

544
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,000
for sure

545
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
so you know core 42 is a couple years

546
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,720
old i haven't seen a new new one list

547
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
for this but you know

548
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,640
over almost 70 percent of security

549
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
leaders say dlp cannot stop inside a

550
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
threat and they're true you know i know

551
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
in my pen testing days i've beaten like

552
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
lots and lots of dlp uh either trying to

553
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,720
get credit cards past it or just get

554
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,039
gobs of data past elps

555
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,880
for one way or another

556
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,960
it can happen encryption is usually the

557
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,520
number one answer to get around those

558
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
unfortunately because you'd have to be

559
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
able to decrypt it uh on the fly to look

560
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,320
for that stuff

561
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
so the other thing is you know also over

562
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,320
60

563
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,559
involve employees planning to leave you

564
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,840
know just if you're going to leave just

565
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,000
leave you know don't uh

566
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,080
try to mess with the employer it's just

567
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
crazy just ask him for trouble

568
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,400
um so that was one of the biggest thing

569
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,679
where they saw

570
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,960
you know everything from stealing

571
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,640
sensitive data that was the number one

572
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,799
thing to getting privileges that they

573
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
shouldn't uh to getting data and even

574
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
sabotage down to five percent of that

575
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
that we're doing that we're trying to

576
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
sabotage and that that's that's what

577
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
most people think oh it's an insider

578
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
threat they're gonna sabotage me but

579
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,919
it's the

580
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,760
data theft that you really have to think

581
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
about it's like what is my ip right what

582
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
am i keeping what's valuable for my

583
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
company you know if we're selling

584
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,360
widgets it could be the design of that

585
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
widget it could be the process of the

586
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
molds to make it everything else you

587
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
have to keep and

588
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
track of

589
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,360
so what are some of the things that

590
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
we're missing right everything from

591
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,960
insufficient data protection strategies

592
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
and solutions

593
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,080
definitely the biggest one is increasing

594
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
number of devices with access sensitive

595
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,480
data

596
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,720
as we've seen over the last couple years

597
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
that you've got this

598
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,360
strain on you know sock teams around the

599
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
world going man everybody's remote i've

600
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,679
got no data island it's

601
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,360
it's getting hit from 500 different

602
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
directions

603
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
that's kind of crazy right

604
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,000
you've got everything from the mobile

605
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,080
side right lots of mobile stuff you've

606
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,760
got a lot of

607
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
machines that are behind a wireless

608
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
network that's at home with a home

609
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,280
router with no security on it

610
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,520
you wouldn't believe how many homes have

611
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
default password for the routers you've

612
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
seen the attacks against d-link linksys

613
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
and so forth that it was default

614
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,679
password they never changed it

615
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,080
i think cable companies

616
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
are some of the worst where they don't

617
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,039
do

618
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,360
a good job of hey you might need to

619
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
reset that password you know and that's

620
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
what should do so if you're starting to

621
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,559
look at some of the new things

622
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,480
that software should be changing that

623
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
password as soon as you get it

624
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
um i know it might not be super

625
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
convenient but it has to be done so we

626
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
can

627
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
get this stuff updated and stop stop

628
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
some of these attacks for sure so i've

629
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,320
seen

630
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,880
like i know like at my house i run

631
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,400
like five different networks and one of

632
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,559
them is a honeypot and i'm looking at

633
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
i'm looking at sideband off of my

634
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,720
internet connection where okay what

635
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,440
attacks are coming at me so i can either

636
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
make sure my networks are protected i've

637
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,200
got some air gap stuff from my lab and

638
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
so forth but it's amazing you just the

639
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
scans every single day that i'm getting

640
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,520
hit by

641
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
i'm still seeing internal blue out there

642
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,080
uh believe it or not um and lots of the

643
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,400
ransomware lots of different you know

644
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,720
looking for you know different ports 135

645
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,880
139 445 looking for those ports uh i've

646
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,600
seen quite a few dns hijack attempts too

647
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,559
lately because i also spoof a dns server

648
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,080
trying to pull dns records out

649
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
then you've got you know more employees

650
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
more contractors partners accessing it

651
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
you know if we look at the attack

652
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,039
against

653
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,080
target several years ago it was the

654
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,400
partner that got breached first and then

655
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
they use that vpn connection to get back

656
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,840
to the main network

657
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,200
again the network wasn't segregated

658
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
they got into one part of the network

659
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
which got them right into the pos

660
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,600
systems

661
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,960
crazy

662
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
definitely we're seeing this increasing

663
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
use of cloud apps and infrastructure how

664
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,799
is that being tested how is it being

665
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,320
verified that hey

666
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,880
i know who did it when they did it and

667
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
possibly why they did it of trying to

668
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,919
get access to data that's that's huge

669
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
that i'm seeing a lot of different

670
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
companies out there that hey we've got

671
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
this great app but okay what are you

672
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,240
doing with my data is it segregated from

673
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
everyone else's on your cloud platform

674
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,960
or not uh is it encrypted do i own the

675
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
encryption key do you own the encryption

676
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
key can i pin test it these are some of

677
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,799
the questions you should be asking um

678
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,559
your providers if you're going to some

679
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,679
of these cloud

680
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,080
instances to see about that we've seen a

681
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
lot of attacks

682
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
recently on

683
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
especially apis

684
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,320
and docker containers especially uh any

685
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,679
of the container stuff because we know

686
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,279
it goes up and down and they have to

687
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
attack fast

688
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
get in get out as quickly as possible

689
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
because we know

690
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,559
uh that dockers can just be wiped out

691
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
restarted and they've lost their

692
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,720
connection so we're seeing a lot of that

693
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
and that's one of the things that keeps

694
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,679
me up at night if so to speak is the use

695
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,919
of apis and how

696
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,240
unsecure a lot of them are they're like

697
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,640
there's no visibility into oh well we

698
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
have it open but you know there's no

699
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,120
auth we just give our api out for people

700
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
to use it's like you've got to have some

701
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
type of off and some r back in there for

702
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,919
sure

703
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,559
so some food for thought for today

704
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,000
and again if there's any questions

705
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
please feel free put your poster

706
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,200
questions in there they'll stop me and i

707
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,799
can answer the questions live for you

708
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
i'd be happy to do that as well i

709
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
definitely love being live

710
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
um you know we've looked at some

711
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,559
regulations and i really liked the gdpr

712
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,440
actually

713
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,360
because as you can see from this several

714
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
years ago is actually they saw a huge

715
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,559
decrease

716
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,120
in um insider threats

717
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
um you know so it fell by over eight

718
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,120
percent

719
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,760
uh in the past 12 months in the uk

720
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,200
while the us

721
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,799
grew 8 percent

722
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,440
that they've seen on the insider threat

723
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
perspective so it's interesting how do

724
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,760
we get that perspective here in the us

725
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,919
and and get some of these controls in

726
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,880
place to where we can alleviate not

727
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
probably not 100 for sure because

728
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,159
there's always a will there's a way

729
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,880
right

730
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
uh to get better visibility get some

731
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,919
better push some things in process where

732
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,480
i'm not changing my security posture

733
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
except making it better right but not

734
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,120
messing with my processes and my

735
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,239
business as well

736
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,960
so definitely some good news this is a

737
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
good one this was going to be a huge

738
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,200
insider threat case so a couple bad guys

739
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,480
basically

740
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,960
talked to a

741
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,600
tesla employee and they said hey we'll

742
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,799
pay you i believe it was 500 000

743
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,919
to insert this thumb drive into the

744
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,480
tesla network right at the gigafactory

745
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,520
uh thank goodness the employee says nope

746
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
um yeah or he didn't really say much

747
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
what he did is contact security they got

748
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,120
with the fbi they set up a sting

749
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
and then they were able to catch these

750
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,559
guys

751
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,559
crazy stuff i mean that's a whole lot of

752
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,520
money just to insert a thumb drive

753
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,919
um i worked a case several years ago as

754
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,520
well it was an insurance case and i got

755
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,679
called by an entrance company at a bank

756
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,760
and they didn't understand they're in a

757
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
high-rise building and they were losing

758
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,760
servers and switches and routers and

759
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,080
different hardware that was just walking

760
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
away and they could never pin it on

761
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
anybody they kept thinking it was the it

762
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
team but they never did anything with it

763
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,080
it actually turned out to be a third

764
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,039
party

765
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,039
and i actually pretended to be part of

766
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
the cleaning crew

767
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,400
for about two weeks until we could

768
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,240
finally we finally caught who was doing

769
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,120
it

770
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,400
they were actually because the cleaning

771
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
crew had access to every single room

772
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
with their car key access they could

773
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,760
just swipe it and they would clean out

774
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,919
the trash cans in the server room which

775
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,840
i can guarantee you now there's no trash

776
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,799
and no one's allowed in the server room

777
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
but they would actually take something

778
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,080
out of the box put it in their trash can

779
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,000
and wheel it right out the front door

780
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
and go into like the service elevator

781
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,440
well back in those highways there was no

782
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
cameras or anything so the bank couldn't

783
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,159
figure out who was stealing it um

784
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
so luckily they did catch the lady that

785
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,840
was doing it um and she turned evidence

786
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
to cyber gang that was actually doing

787
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,279
the thefts uh with her and they paid her

788
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,520
basically 500 every time she walked out

789
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
of the building with a piece of hardware

790
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,559
so crazy stuff

791
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
so some of the stuff that you should be

792
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,480
reading and i'm kind of looking at this

793
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,559
this one is put on by the national

794
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,799
counterintelligence security center i've

795
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
got the link at the bottom

796
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
and again my slides will be available so

797
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
if you can't write this down fast enough

798
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,039
you can look for this insider threat

799
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,799
mitigation for u.s critical

800
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,039
infrastructure entities it's a good it's

801
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,279
actually a good reading for looking at

802
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
some of the mitigation you can do

803
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
against not just critical infrastructure

804
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,720
but your own entities i mean definitely

805
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,559
if you have critical infrastructure

806
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,840
i think everyone has some type of

807
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
critical infrastructure that they've got

808
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
to keep up so that's really good it just

809
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
got published last october

810
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,720
so it's at the dni.gov so you can look

811
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,360
up insider threat mitigation for that

812
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,559
another one is the insider threats and

813
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,039
commercial espionage

814
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,960
for economic and national security

815
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
impacts this is from the insa and this

816
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
is for their insider threat subcommittee

817
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
as well so this one was published

818
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,159
last year

819
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,480
may i believe oh five yeah

820
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,880
so another good one to read also it can

821
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,399
give you some of those steps and some of

822
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,480
the things you need to be

823
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
watching out for uh for sure when

824
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,080
dealing with uh insider threads

825
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
so i know my talk is kind of quick but

826
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,919
before i get give you dave's top ten um

827
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,240
i'll tell you one more

828
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
insider threat story here so several

829
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,279
years ago his work got a call from

830
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,360
one of my business partners and he goes

831
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,320
hey

832
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,240
i've got a customer in such and such

833
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,120
city

834
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
that said they think they're being

835
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
bugged and they think they have someone

836
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,799
that's you know basically breached their

837
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,360
network can read all their emails and

838
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,320
everything they think all their

839
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
communications are

840
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
affected as well so it's like okay okay

841
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,679
i'll talk to the guy so um didn't have a

842
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,760
phone number but the guy called me

843
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,360
from a burner phone

844
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,840
and it was the cio

845
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,000
and so we met the guy

846
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,440
actually he wanted to meet at like one

847
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,039
o'clock in the morning

848
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,120
at basically an empty parking lot

849
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,919
uh of course i brought uh some uh some

850
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,520
bodyguard for that

851
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
because we trusted the guy but you know

852
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,799
you just never know right after you know

853
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,159
we definitely did our due diligence

854
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,159
before we had this you know meeting

855
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,960
super nice guy explained to he's like

856
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,159
you know dave

857
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
we think all my columns are being or

858
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,679
compromised that's the only reason he

859
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
wanted to meet to where it wasn't at the

860
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,440
office or anything like that

861
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
and what was interesting though is so we

862
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
formulated a plan they thought they knew

863
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,080
who was doing it

864
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,440
uh it was an insider it was a

865
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
the network administrator the main guy

866
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,679
and he had been there for almost 10

867
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,640
years

868
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
and so we set up a sting we actually

869
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,880
would sit there we got at his computer

870
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,159
we put spyware keylogger and screen grab

871
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,880
software on his machine and tied it

872
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
directly to the cio's machine so the cio

873
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,399
could see what's happening with no one

874
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,200
else

875
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,440
not even us so we actually installed it

876
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,919
at like three o'clock in the morning

877
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,840
and then we walked out

878
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,919
but we also you know had to reboot his

879
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,880
computer we covered our tracks and

880
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
thinking what this guy was doing based

881
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,360
on some other factors we actually turned

882
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
off all the computers in front of his

883
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,520
office and rebooted all of them simulate

884
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,760
a power failure basically

885
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,159
he came in the very next day got on his

886
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,399
computer the very first thing he did he

887
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,279
logged in and he went directly to his

888
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,080
app logs his windows logs he looked at

889
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,679
the system log he looked at the login

890
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,760
log and the application log he wanted to

891
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
see if anything was installed or

892
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
anything that was it logged

893
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,440
luckily for him he didn't find anything

894
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
because otherwise this would have been a

895
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,440
short trip uh we cleared our track so he

896
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
couldn't see anything

897
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
and you know did some other file date

898
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,559
modifications as well

899
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,880
and then he proceeded to get out and

900
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
then we didn't see anything

901
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,159
then he went out to look at the

902
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,360
commuters in front of them and he

903
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,200
noticed oh looks like it was a power

904
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,360
power failure so he came and sat back

905
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,399
down

906
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,080
then the next thing he did he spent the

907
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,519
next 30 minutes

908
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,840
reading everyone's email and he opened

909
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
up the email of the top 40 people in the

910
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
company everybody from the attorneys

911
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
to the cio to the ceo uh and accounting

912
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,360
he had a he had literally 40 people that

913
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,039
he was going through the emails and he

914
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,640
what he was doing is taking those and

915
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,399
copying them and sticking them on thumb

916
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,519
drive

917
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,760
uh as soon as that happened the seat in

918
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,080
the cio saw that he called us and says

919
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,480
hey i think we got this guy so we you

920
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,159
know left the hotel rushed back over

921
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:54,960
there

922
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
and they already pulled him out they had

923
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
him downstairs

924
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
waiting for law enforcement to show up

925
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
so they could he could get arrested law

926
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
enforcement showed up

927
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
they had their case put together with

928
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,880
the

929
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,360
company attorney and this guy definitely

930
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
did not want to say a word

931
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,039
and i was just curious so i asked him

932
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,320
it's like hey can i spend a couple

933
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,679
minutes with him i'd like to see if

934
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,679
he'll talk to me and tell tell me what

935
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,320
what the deal was um so i did i got to

936
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,080
talk to him for a few minutes and it was

937
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,919
interesting he actually told me what was

938
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,519
going on

939
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,960
he was actually selling these emails to

940
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
competitors people that were getting

941
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,519
acquired so this one particular company

942
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,120
as a financial company was acquiring

943
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
other little financial companies

944
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,679
and he was selling it so they could get

945
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,440
raise their bids basically so they can

946
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,519
try to get more money

947
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,240
and he did this for over a year

948
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,559
now he sold information to a little over

949
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,120
a dozen different companies how much do

950
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,679
you think he made out of this uh we're

951
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,120
talking about a multi-billion dollar

952
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
financial company that was acquiring

953
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,080
others

954
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,200
uh believe it or not he only made about

955
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
fifty thousand dollars

956
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,799
uh out of this uh the transactions were

957
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,159
not very big

958
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,240
uh and all that kind of stuff uh it was

959
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
a real shame because you know talking to

960
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,880
the cio he was super nice guy he'd go to

961
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
all the barbecues and all that kind of

962
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,440
stuff

963
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,360
but he just he threw his life away so

964
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,039
yeah he ended up getting sent to jail

965
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,919
for almost nine years uh on that

966
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,960
so

967
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,279
not not good times for that for that guy

968
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,880
for sure

969
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
so i know i've brought up a couple cases

970
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,640
where i've had some rogue admins and

971
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,120
stuff like that pretty rare most of my

972
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
cases don't deal on that side they deal

973
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
on

974
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,240
the other side where it's usually just

975
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,080
regular employees that are you know

976
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,399
either getting privilege escalation

977
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,399
or uh you know stealing data they

978
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,799
shouldn't get

979
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,039
so that's what we normally see

980
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,480
or it's the

981
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
sabotage

982
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
hey david

983
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,200
sorry to interrupt you it looks like um

984
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,960
there was a hiccup in the system and you

985
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
got muted is there any chance you can

986
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,560
just verify that you can unmute yourself

987
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
how about now can you hear me now yeah i

988
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
think with some insider threat here we

989
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,040
must have accidentally just uh got

990
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,880
somebody meeting me okay yeah there was

991
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,240
a hiccup i just saw that the live

992
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,680
broadcast stopped for a moment and then

993
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,839
all of a sudden you were muted

994
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,839
you're good to go you might mean to back

995

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,480
that i swear i didn't touch the uh the

999
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
keyboard my hands are here

1000
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,119
uh like vegas hands uh so we'll go

1001
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,800
through this real quick so

1002
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
again always treat your network as

1003
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,480
hostile always assume breached uh

1004
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
definitely no one's immune to malware

1005
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,839
we've seen that we've seen all the crazy

1006
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,320
malwares my key thing here is have that

1007
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,560
post breach strategy ready so i've seen

1008
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,720
plenty of customers that don't have

1009
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,880
uh that strategy ready so they're

1010
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,599
scrambling at the last minute have that

1011
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
tested saying okay guys we're going to

1012
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
simulate a breach today we've lost such

1013
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
and such data what do we do uh do we you

1014
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,359
know get the help desk do we get the

1015
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,440
users do we get uh the attorneys

1016
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,119
involved what what all where's our

1017
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
backups all that kind of stuff

1018
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,560
uh definitely don't forget about the

1019
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,720
insider threat

1020
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,079
i know this is a family show so i'll

1021
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,359
repeat one more time we'll come back to

1022
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,880
number two

1023
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,240
know your network

1024
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,280
and i say that because i worked a case

1025
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,119
with the city government several years

1026
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,720
ago that

1027
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,040
when we got in and i started asking my

1028
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,960
general three questions you know i ask

1029
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,640
where the dns logs where's your backups

1030
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,079
and where's the bathroom

1031
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,400
uh but on that case i also asked what's

1032
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,599
the network look like where's your

1033
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,520
ingress and egross points and they

1034
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
actually brought me a map that was like

1035
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,599
six years old

1036
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
that was not even valid wasn't even

1037
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,839
current nothing so we actually had to go

1038
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,800
through and find all the stuff for them

1039
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
and that put us behind a couple days for

1040
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,200
sure

1041
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,400
so uh back to log everything and i don't

1042
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
mean every single packet but the

1043
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
metadata so we know your dhcp we know

1044
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,280
your dns request and have that

1045
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,359
unfiltered data i'm a strong believer in

1046
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,119
the 30 60 90 a day rule so have all that

1047
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,119
metadata for 30 days

1048
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,760
chop off a piece for 60 days so you keep

1049
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
part of it for 60 and then so forth to

1050
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,880
90.

1051
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
it's really important it's all about

1052
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
that visibility because you're not going

1053
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
to catch nation nation-state attackers

1054
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
versus insiders versus anything else if

1055
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,599
you don't have that visibility

1056
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,920
definitely train your security staff

1057
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,680
doing events like b-sides which is

1058
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,800
awesome

1059
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,599
definitely go to those you get great uh

1060
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,599
word of mouth you get great training you

1061
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,359
get great content hopefully everyone's

1062
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,760
enjoyed this content today

1063
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,440
uh number three security awareness for

1064
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,800
everyone and i don't mean that click

1065
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,280
click click you know hey hr yep i'm

1066
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,560
quote certified uh for that but real

1067
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,280
security awareness and uh one of my

1068
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,760
friends i know did a great one for a a

1069
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,000
bank they were doing and they actually

1070
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
they walked in with a bunch of balloons

1071
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,000
and a cake and went to one of the floors

1072
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,200
as a big high-rise like 12 stories and

1073
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,160
found this lady and and everyone thought

1074
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,400
oh it's you know so-and-so's birthday it

1075
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,960
wasn't her birthday what she had done is

1076
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
reported a fishing attempt that turned

1077
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
out to be real it was a real phishing

1078
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,359
attempt

1079
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,680
to try to steal money from the bank and

1080
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,119
she reported it

1081
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,920
and so that was part of the security

1082
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,240
awareness was you know hey

1083
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
here's a cake here's some balloons and

1084
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
everyone noticed really really quick so

1085
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,280
the day before that happened they were

1086
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,680
only getting like 40

1087
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
you know of you know thousands employees

1088
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,880
only like 40 phishing emails sent to it

1089
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,119
department uh very few

1090
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,320
after that day they got over 400 a month

1091
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
it was just like boom boom boom boom and

1092
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
they were much much better their their

1093
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,760
chances of getting hit by some of these

1094
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,079
fishing went way way down

1095
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,480
hey dave got a question for you from

1096
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
from an anonymous user he wanted to know

1097
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,760
if you have evidence that an

1098
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
organization you've done business with

1099
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
has had your data stolen or leaked and

1100
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
you identify the individual what is a

1101
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,240
good route to pursue them

1102
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
uh the best route is called law

1103
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,960
enforcement is number one so save

1104
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,000
whatever evidence you have uh and that

1105
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,920
way they can make a case

1106
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
because unfortunately if you give it all

1107
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,920
to the company they might wash it under

1108
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,079
you know the sink and say oh well okay

1109
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,079
yeah we paid that guy off to get rid of

1110
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,839
him so we won't leak our data

1111
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,119
uh

1112
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,520
my my thing is bring in law enforcement

1113
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,560
um

1114
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
whether it's you know the cyber task

1115
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
force or whatnot uh to do that that's

1116
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,720
definitely going to be the best

1117
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,240
and and make sure you

1118
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,880
uh unless they tell you otherwise keep a

1119
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,040
copy of what evidence you have as well

1120
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,640
thanks great great question great

1121

having me out today

1145
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,119
it's been an awesome talk david i gotta

1146
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,480
tell you it's just

1147
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,560
great stuff to think about you know

1148
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
insiders are always the they say the

1149
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,720
biggest weakness in security but they

1150
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
can also be your biggest asset if you

1151
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
were to look at it from the other side

1152
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,720
of it

1153
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,319
what would you think are the top three

1154
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,640
things you give your top ten if you had

1155
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,560
to think about this from

1156
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,720
an organization a security person has to

1157
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
come back to work and say listen we need

1158
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,880
to start doing these other things

1159
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,359
is it really

1160
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,280
about making sure you're able to monitor

1161
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
them is it the ability of educating them

1162
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,119
what would you feel would be the first

1163
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,200
thing you would want them to do

1164
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,000
uh

1165
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,839
yeah and i don't want to put that false

1166
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,680
narrative out there you know a lot of

1167
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,440
people go oh well security teams

1168
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
watching everything we do

1169
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,640
you can watch a lot of stuff with

1170
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,880
metadata without infringing on anyone's

1171
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,920
privacy

1172
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,040
or you know trying to quote spy on them

1173
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,200
so my biggest thing is get visibility

1174
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,760
have that metadata so i can see what

1175
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,520
applications are running what data is

1176
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,119
going around my network that kind of

1177
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,079
stuff uh but the other thing is and you

1178
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,000
said you hit the nail right on the on

1179
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,520
the hammer there was uh that security

1180
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,160
awareness and that training of my users

1181
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,280
so they understand the importance of hey

1182
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,839
we have valuable data we don't want it

1183
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,560
to leave you like your job

1184
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
everyone that's it's everyone in is in

1185
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,400
this together how do we protect that

1186
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,839
data

1187
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,400
and that's big so i've seen lots in the

1188
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,319
last couple years where companies that

1189
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,800
have taken that approach have been way

1190
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,520
more successful because now it's not

1191
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,040
like you've got someone tattling on

1192
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,400
someone else but if they see some

1193
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,319
wrongdoing man they're going to be quick

1194
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,560
to point it out and says hey i think joe

1195
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,480
is stealing you know whatever and sally

1196
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,920
and giving it to sally who's selling it

1197
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,720
somebody else or you know what not

1198
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,079
because it's good for everyone because

1199
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,920
if someone destroys the company guess

1200
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,800
what everyone loses right i think mubix

1201
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,560
kind of covered it really well in his

1202
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
keynote when it was talking about

1203
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,359
one of the things is while we can try to

1204
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,880
put you know security dna in the

1205
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,640
organization not everyone are security

1206
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,960
people you can't expect them to be that

1207
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,800
in a lot of cases when we look at the

1208
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,040
lateral movements and and and how it's

1209
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,119
happening inside the organization there

1210
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,680
are fundamental security principles that

1211
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,760
are typically at play here like least

1212
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,440
privileged not being applied the

1213
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,119
secretary doesn't need access to the

1214
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,599
database server why why are we applying

1215
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,040
that we can go and say it's the

1216
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
secretary's fault for plugging in that

1217
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
usb key but the reality is is the best

1218
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,960
security systems that are out there and

1219
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,480
the policies and anything you can put in

1220
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,400
place are the ones that employees never

1221
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,160
see unless they do something they're not

1222
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,079
supposed to at which case that's when

1223
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,720
the security system should be kicking in

1224
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
education is important but we can't rely

1225
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,960
on the people to always get it right

1226
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,240
they're the biggest weakness in the

1227
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,760
organization but they can be only be our

1228
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
biggest assets if we're being

1229
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,119
responsible in applying everything else

1230
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,960
that's there oh for sure i mean i'll

1231
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,200
give you a prime example so

1232
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,400
i worked a lot with hospitals so

1233
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,560
uh you know hospitals especially down in

1234
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,359
hollywood los angeles have a lot of vip

1235
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,520
customers that generally do not come

1236
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,040
under their name they're always under

1237
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,079
pseudo names and they they have certain

1238
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,800
rooms and floors where

1239
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,079
you know people they don't want this

1240
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,359
this movie star or whatever they don't

1241
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,760
want that information to get out

1242
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,839
and i've helped them put policies in

1243
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,359
place in monitoring so that way you know

1244
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,720
uh uh a floor nurse on the third floor

1245
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,160
can't see what's happening on the fourth

1246
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,240
floor so she gets on the computer saying

1247
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,680
oh i want to see i you know i know

1248
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
britney spears is here so and you know

1249
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,359
she goes by you know

1250
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,720
roger rabbit or something whatever name

1251
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
she chooses but you see what i'm saying

1252
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
if the software's monitoring for that

1253
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,720
it's like okay if you're a nurse on the

1254
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,960
third floor that's the only patience

1255
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,119
that you should be accessing right if i

1256
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,880
access something else out of that i need

1257
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,720
to i need an alarm bill to go off i need

1258
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,400
to be able to see that and say you know

1259
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,240
what that nurse shouldn't be doing that

1260
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,160
and we actually caught

1261
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,440
a couple nurses in hollywood doing that

1262
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,040
that were selling information one person

1263
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,440
was in the ref records department so she

1264
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,520
had access to everything but her cousin

1265
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,920
worked up on this particular floor in

1266
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,160
this hospital and they were sending

1267
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
notes back and forth comparing

1268
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
and trying to sell that information to

1269
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,480
the tabloids uh but luckily the system

1270
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,720
we put in place which did not infringe

1271
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,040
on anybody's job they never even knew it

1272
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,520
was there but when the time came

1273
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,599
uh they could you know they could flag

1274
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,440
it right they could flag who's accessing

1275
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,079
this quote vip's information

1276
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,200
yeah

1277
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,759
that's awesome

1278
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,440
a good time all right let me check and

1279
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,000
see if there's any last minute questions

1280
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,319
one moment

1281
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,680
so there's a question here do you have

1282
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,920
any suggestions for public templates or

1283
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,240
a source where someone can refer to to

1284
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,000
start drafting an insider threat

1285
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,720
incident playbook

1286
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,040
oh that's good um

1287
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,359
i don't have any like resource off top

1288
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,880
my head uh i'd be happy you know uh

1289
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
if you get my email or dm me and twitter

1290
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,359
i'd be happy to give you some stuff uh

1291
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,119
for sure i think the biggest thing on

1292
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,319
insider playbook is the same as any

1293
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,640
malicious actor it doesn't matter it's

1294
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,520
just they've got the inside piece right

1295
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,680
the biggest thing is that uh the

1296
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,760
visibility into the metadata that i keep

1297
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
talking about whether it's you know if

1298
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,160
they're getting dhcp or they've got vdi

1299
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,920
how do we capture who was on that vdi

1300
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,520
session when they did it

1301
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,160
what usb drives are being used uh that

1302
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,680
kind of stuff

1303
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,880
that's going to be some of the biggest

1304
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,680
playbooks and but you need to have some

1305
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,480
criteria as well and that criteria is

1306
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,559
really going to center around okay

1307
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,240
what is our ip you've got to identify

1308
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,839
the you know

1309
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,000
the keys to the castle so if i don't

1310
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,280
know what theirs i'm not going to know

1311
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,960
what to watch anyways

1312
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
i can't just watch everything all the

1313
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,160
time but i need to watch that very

1314
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,559
specific day it's like okay this data

1315
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,319
only these people should have access to

1316
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,000
it whether that's the accounting system

1317
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,440
only the accountants should have access

1318
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,720
to that

1319
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,000
that's going to be the biggest thing in

1320
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,480
quote a playbook right is to look at

1321
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,960
those kind of scenarios and say okay

1322
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,599
if x y and z happens and it shouldn't

1323
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,359
belong to that person then we need to

1324
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,880
take a look at it and then the next step

1325
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,200
is going to go okay now i can open up an

1326
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,040
investigation you know what and if it

1327
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,800
looks if it's benign boom i throw it

1328
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,319
away and keep going

1329
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,680
but if it's not

1330
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,359
you've got to get to that point to where

1331
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,760
what is going to set off your red flags

1332
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,599
in your environment versus anybody

1333
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,040
else's

1334
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,400
to be open in those investigations

1335
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,720
that's great i i also just posted a book

1336
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,800
title for someone if you want to look

1337
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,359
it's an older book i think it's like

1338
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,160
mid 2000s called inside the security

1339
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,079
mind by kevin day

1340
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,559
where he talks about it from not only

1341
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,720
looking at building out the playbooks

1342
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,559
but understanding how to think about

1343
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,319
this what you're going to apply and how

1344
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,160
to apply it and then how to monitor and

1345
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,520
manage that so

1346
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,319
um

1347
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,240
it's like i said it is an older book but

1348
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,040
the principles um really help in in

1349
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
those type of scenarios

1350
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
yeah so what i put on the screen is like

1351
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,440
again get these two files if you can uh

1352
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,760
leave it up on here on the screen uh i

1353
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,200
provided the link in the chat for them

1354
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,040
on the phone awesome i wasn't able to

1355
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,200
get the second one but i go oh okay so

1356
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,599
here's the second one um so this is

1357
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,520
really good stuff for to help with those

1358
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,440
kind of playbooks and stuff uh

1359
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,960
especially around this one especially

1360
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
around the commercial espionage uh

1361
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,800
because we've seen a lot of the quote

1362
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
commercial espionage it's like

1363
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,640
how do you vet your employees how are

1364
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,680
they hired uh how many times you know

1365
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,599
has you've heard of oh this is an

1366
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,640
insider and they were selling

1367
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,880
information like the guy from you know

1368
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,960
um google try to you know grab that

1369
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,680
information from wammo and sell it to uh

1370
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,440
to uber where he was going where he was

1371
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
offered a job now they they were working

1372
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,520
in cahoots uh and that's the biggest

1373
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,319
thing but notice they were caught

1374
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,559
because of the monitoring software that

1375
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,760
they had was able to nail them down and

1376
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,760
say okay why would this person copying

1377
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,680
14 000 it doesn't fit their job

1378
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,040
description

1379
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,240
for sure

1380
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,720
i actually worked a lot of insider

1381
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,359
threat for some government agencies uh

1382
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,440
some manufacturing we'll call it that

1383
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,599
and

1384
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,920
on that i mean i got down to the point

1385
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,200
to where in between buildings i could

1386
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,520
time how long it took to walk between

1387
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,040
buildings and i know

1388
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
that joe couldn't be logged in at

1389
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,040
building a and then all sudden 20

1390
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,880
seconds later log into building b

1391
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,880
because i knew it took three minutes

1392
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,119
and we just had it set up in the sim we

1393
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,440
can look at the login times between two

1394
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,520
and says okay if it falls under this

1395
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,680
threshold guess what raise a red flag

1396
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,680
start my playbook start my investigation

1397
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,880
that's awesome

1398
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,559
uh someone in one of the comments said

1399
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,920
was following up on the previous

1400
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,119
question about bringing in law

1401
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,280
enforcement and the question is annie's

1402
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,680
asking referring back to anon's question

1403
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,839
if you bring in law enforcement before a

1404
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,079
company is aware would the company get

1405
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,400
upset or maybe it doesn't matter if they

1406
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,599
do

1407
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,000
um it all depends i've seen it both ways

1408
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,760
i've seen companies get very upset oh my

1409
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,160
god you know this person's gonna be is

1410
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,599
malicious to my company he's like no i

1411
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,680
want to protect the data right i want to

1412
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,839
if if if my data has been breached i i

1413
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,920
want to know about it uh

1414
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,800
but the

1415
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,880
the thing here that's really hurt the

1416
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,040
industry is you've had companies that

1417
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,359
have said have you know put it under the

1418
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,280
rug so to speak they didn't want to get

1419
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,640
their name out in the news they didn't

1420
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,960
want to get that but i i think it's it's

1421
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,359
got to come to a point especially now

1422
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,559
we're seeing a bunch of it uh and don't

1423
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,079
worry about hurting someone's feelings

1424
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,960
if you've gotten your data stolen um yes

1425
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,480
report it to the company report it to

1426
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,760
law enforcement because you just never

1427
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,839
know you don't want it you know

1428
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,440
swept under the rug because we've seen

1429
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,319
lots of companies do that unfortunately

1430
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,440
because they think it's going to save

1431
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,359
their reputation i think the companies

1432
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,760
that are out there in front saying hey

1433
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
something got messed up you know this is

1434
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,200
what got stolen we're doing something

1435
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,200
about it thank you joe for turning this

1436
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,000
in

1437
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
that was awesome uh that's how they

1438
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,240
should react uh but

1439
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,920
you know you can see over the last 10

1440
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,520
years they haven't you've had lots of

1441
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,760
companies go nope you're a whistleblower

1442
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,800
you're not a whistleblower we're going

1443
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,280
to go after you uh there was a an

1444
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,000
incident was about a year and a half ago

1445
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,920
state government uh

1446
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,760
basically a pen tester found a hole in a

1447
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,040
government website and reported it and

1448
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,640
and even though they had a quote bug

1449
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,720
mounting program they're like oh no p

1450
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,559
was a malicious person he was trying to

1451
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,599
hack us

1452
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,440
and he didn't do anything all he did was

1453
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,280
report hey this has got a cross-site

1454
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,400
scripting

1455
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,079
issue y'all need to do something about

1456
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,440
it and fix it

1457
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,880
i mean they tried to take this guy to

1458
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
court they tried to get him arrested all

1459
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,559
this other stuff and they finally the

1460
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,640
government had to back off because

1461
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,839
everyone in the industry was like no

1462
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,599
this guy didn't do anything wrong

1463
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,040
he found a hole

1464
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,640
he told you about it and you didn't want

1465
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,760
to do anything about it because they

1466
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,599

1496
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,400
awesome i always love hearing about the

1497
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,839
different types of threats from the

1498
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,920
insider side and you know

1499
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,839
stats be gone you know at the end of the

1500
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,599
day you can look at things i look at

1501
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,839
great examples even at state level with

1502
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,599
things like stuxnet and just the

1503
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,200
complexity of trying to get over air gap

1504
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,559
networks and trying to getting

1505
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,240
organizations and you know you sharing

1506
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,599
the one about tesla i always laugh at

1507
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:22,720
that one

1508
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,880
awesome that the tesla employee had the

1509
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,079
um moral fortitude to let you know not

1510
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,079
take half a million bucks to plug in

1511
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,079
your e-stick right um and but it's

1512
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,680
coming more and more ransomware gangs

1513
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,119
are are are

1514
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,040
are sharing in the wealth with any

1515
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,200
employee that's willing to get there and

1516
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
when i think about things like you know

1517
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,000
like the rubber duckies and the omg

1518
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,319
cables and just how easy these payloads

1519
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,400
are getting to be able to be deployed

1520
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,559
physically in these organizations

1521
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,480
it really comes down to your people but

1522
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,680
then i get back to you know the

1523
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,520
conversation we're talking before about

1524
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,319
well why are we allowing people who

1525
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,319
don't need that kind of privilege to be

1526
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,960
able to have this stuff pivot into these

1527
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,359
other uh areas i think mubic's point

1528
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,880
during his keynote about things like

1529
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
make sure every laptop or every desktop

1530
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,280
is being treated as its own container

1531
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,000
its own isolation that helps it's not

1532
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,319
going to solve everything but uh if we

1533
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,839
assume breach and assume people are

1534
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,119
going to plug in hostile um sticks uh i

1535
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,799
think we would be in a much better place

1536
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,079
as a people

1537
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,640
oh yeah for sure yeah it's it's funny

1538
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,160
everything you mentioned i have in my

1539
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,079
bag sitting next to me uh yeah i have it

1540
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,559
too right like we have a lot of tested

1541
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,480
the coffee shop and and just playing

1542
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,160
around with especially the new omg stuff

1543
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,240
it's just just phenomenal just even on

1544
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,119
data exfiltration off of these cables so

1545
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,599
it's just amazing what can be done um

1546
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,040
when we're talking physical for this

1547
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,799
kind of stuff i mean you have to think

1548
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,559
you know

1549
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,559
that i have got so many tools and stuff

1550
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,480
or or software that i've written in

1551
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,880
scripts and whatever uh to break into

1552
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,280
networks just imagine what and i'm just

1553
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,520
a lone person the nation state stuff of

1554
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,280
course you brought up stuxnet and you

1555
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,760
know i've got it in my lab it's crazy

1556
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,920
even today that stuff is super scary uh

1557
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,720
so

1558
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,480
well you look at the payloads that are

1559
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,680
you know darren the stuff he's doing

1560
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,520
over at hack five like some of the stuff

1561
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
on his github repo and the way they're

1562
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,240
now um you know providing prizes for

1563
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,920
some of the best payloads these are

1564
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
getting so much more sophisticated and

1565
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,319
have way more capabilities it's not just

1566
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,400
a matter of being able to type in a few

1567
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,000
keystrokes to get some interesting

1568
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,520
things we're talking about full

1569
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,119
interpreter back doors in a matter of a

1570
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,599
couple seconds and and you know state

1571
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,200
actors are going to be able to take out

1572
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,520
the next level so great to be scared but

1573
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,280
it's also the back too this is where the

1574
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,799
blue team's got to do a better job of

1575
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,720
making sure that they're going to assume

1576
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,760
that these type of things are hitting

1577
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,359
what are they doing about it

1578
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,359
yeah and and i'll definitely leave my

1579
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,000
final two cents here is visibility

1580
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,480
visibility visibility if you don't have

1581
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,160
the visibility you're not going to catch

1582
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,520
anybody

1583
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,280
and that's what i want blue teams you

1584
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,960
know when i go and try to you know i'm

1585
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,040
on the red team and and i love being on

1586
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,799
the blue team because i love trying to

1587
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,400
throw off the red teams that are trying

1588
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,640
to attack me but it's getting that

1589
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,160
visibility that's the very first thing i

1590
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,559
talk to customers about uh our clients

1591
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,040
that i'm talking to is like guys

1592
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,640
you can throw all this technology at it

1593
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,839
but guess what if you don't have that

1594
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,280
visibility you're not going to see that

1595
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,040
threat you're just not and you're going

1596
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,359
to lose every single time

1597
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,440
awesome well david thanks again we're

1598
