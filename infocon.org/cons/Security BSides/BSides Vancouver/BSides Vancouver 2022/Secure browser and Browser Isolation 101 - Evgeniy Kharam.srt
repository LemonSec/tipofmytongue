1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
like uh welcome to the b-sides Vancouver

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,620
2022

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,240
um either Jenny is going to speak about

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,599
browser security isolation 101.

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,800
um take it away Jenny

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,780
thank you very much good morning good

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,100
afternoon good evening I guess it's more

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
good afternoon for Vancouver it's a bit

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,720
slight older uh later for me I'm in

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,480
Toronto so it's 5 00 PM for me so let's

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,560
begin

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,500
as you probably know

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,019
we all spent quite a lot of time in the

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,340
internet and majority of the

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,620
applications we are right now touching

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,960
our browser related

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,660
and it means that we're spend quite a

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,120
lot of time in the browser and with the

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,520
amount of the bad guys in the amount of

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
automation right now having in the

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,780
Internet it's quite important to protect

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,239
ourselves much much better if you think

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,640
about this and all the automation we've

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,559
been doing so far in our corporate

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,899
environment the bad guys can do pretty

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,120
much the same automation on their end

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,100
and it's been the moment we spin or

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,199
start a website

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,540
in a couple of minutes the bad guys can

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,520
spend a very similar websites or the

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,200
potentially we find vulnerabilities in

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,659
the websites and they may in fact this

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,340
website with a lot of malicious things

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,040
or put fishing links there as well

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
so it's quite important to figure out

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,820
what's the best way to protect us and

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,140
we're going to talk about browservation

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,479
and browser security what's happening in

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,580
this market why it's important and what

40
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,439
you can do to protect yourself better I

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,880
kind of miss the slide by mistake so

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,759
I'll go back I'm evgeny I work full time

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,619
in a company called herjoy group you may

44
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,600
know Robert from Dancing With The Star

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,220
Shark Tank Dragon then and many other

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,380
shows but his main business is cyber

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,439
security been there for 15 years I also

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,180
started a podcast with Dimitri around

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,000
two years about security architecture we

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,159
did a lot of stuff Network related and

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,439
security related security related but

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,820
today we will talk about browser

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,740
isolation and browser security so let's

54
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,740
look on some stats there's more than 18

55
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,360
billion different websites on the

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,280
internet and based on security weekly

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
around two three years ago was did the

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,540
research they realize there's one

59
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,098
percent of these websites are malicious

60
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,679
one percent is actually 18 million

61
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,319
websites if we look on awesome top 10

62
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,980
we'll see that they found more than 95

63
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,920
four percent of websites are susceptible

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,260
to some kind of an attack broken Access

65
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,480
Control injections and many many other

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,459
things and this means that it's

67
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,580
relatively easy to do something bad with

68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,860
the websites and when you browse you

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,739
cannot be very reactive you want to be

70
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,019
proactive when you're browsing and when

71
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,360
you're defending your companies and your

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,700
networks as well

73
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,459
interestingly enough last week I was

74
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,099
checking for Teppanyaki this whole code

75
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,540
in Canada and if you're in US you're

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,580
probably called Hibachi and I want to

77
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,680
eat some food in Markham in Toronto

78
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
because I was doing a bit of research on

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,420
the topic I popped and want to realize

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,220
how many javascripts and domains and

81
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,319
links they have in a website this is a

82
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,140
simple website for food for restaurant

83
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,200
there's no even order online

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,019
they have 55 different javascripts and

85
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,360
certain domains that link to somewhere

86
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,580
you know how much CNN has and many other

87
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,340
sites has much much more and what I want

88
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,379
to show here is that there's a lot of

89
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,879
dynamic things happening with the

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
website if you're not always aware about

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,980
them so it's important to figure out

92
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,500
what we can do about it the and the web

93
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,799
itself is very very big attack Vector

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,959
majority of the phishing attacks and

95
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,000
social network and browsing are

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,580
happening through there we always talk

97
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,019
how the attack started it was

98
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,700
efficiently somebody send us something

99
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,239
we got a text message SMS or something

100
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,920
else when we click on the link and we

101
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,540
downloaded

102
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,239
malware or something else

103
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,360
I do want to speak quickly what we can

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,060
prevent using browser isolation and

105
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,299
browser security type of controls the

106
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,400
list is probably very very familiar to

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,159
you you see many many

108
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,180
attacks that are very widespread and

109
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,459
used all the time and I'll go a bit

110
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,200
deeper later on even so it's one-on-one

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,580
we're not going to go very deep but I

112
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,440
will explain the ideas and how it can be

113
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,418
done and why it's very very effective

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,520
interesting interesting part our

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,720
industry is pretty much not going around

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
but we are very focused to explain how

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,419
we can work with miter Q chain was one

118
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,100
one of course miter is one of the main

119
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,680
Frameworks that we explain how we can

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,139
defend what we use in a stock how vendor

121
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,660
aligned to this as well

122
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,880
the interesting part that Q chain has

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,060
seven steps miter has 14 step the surf

124
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,120
tabs steps in both framework is one

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,220
delivery One initial access it's

126
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,060
basically the part where a malware is

127
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,220
downloading on your machine or something

128
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,660
happen with your machine where

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,820
everything else is started with browser

130
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,979
isolation and browser security this is

131
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,960
where we can stop it that's it there are

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,180
no more steps because it didn't go to us

133
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,940
it's isolated from what we're doing

134
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,100
right now and what's happening

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,720
right now when I present this

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,580
information there is nothing really in

137
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,380
miter that talking about browse

138
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,240
resolution but I did support with

139
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,460
certain people and folks in miter and

140
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,539
they do working to add more isolation in

141
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,580
the miter attack framework because we

142
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,380
all believe understand how important it

143
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,220
is

144
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,680
also if you look on zero trust very very

145
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,900
popular topic almost magical acronyms

146
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,759
that people use all the time and it's

147
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,180
800 207 they talk about how we can align

148
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,520
to zero trust and what we can do and

149
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,919
they do call about price oscillation is

150
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,979
one of the techniques on the left you

151
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,600
see how it can download the endpoint

152
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
basically something I have on my laptop

153
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,620
and how it's done remotely both

154
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,919
framework and architecture are aligned

155
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,259
to what we're talking today so it's a

156
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,400
very interesting document around 50

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,440
pages is even already before you go to

158
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
bed I suggest to read because there's a

159
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,580
lot of interesting good information

160
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,160
there as well

161
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,740
I do want to go back and talk about the

162
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,120
history a bit this is not progression

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,919
it's more about the history because in

164
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,819
the end of the day we're talking about

165
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,100
web we're talking about URLs we're

166
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,900
talking about where we're browsing it's

167
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,180
mean we need to classify in a way and

168
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,520
figure out what potentially we allow or

169
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,520
not allow so around 20 years ago we

170
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,460
started with your categorization in

171
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,860
majority of the cases where it began it

172
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,080
was in school and universities because

173
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,240
there was a mandate to prevent people to

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,039
go to sort of websites you can probably

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,380
guess what kind of websites later on

176
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,940
with tradition to more Dynamic

177
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,940
categories where we were able to block

178
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,819
malware with rock fishing or basically

179
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,220
new domain websites it's quite important

180
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,400
because there's probably no reason for

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,500
you to go and

182
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,660
browse to our website that was started

183
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,220
yesterday only if you're doing your

184
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,160
research and of course we still use all

185
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,900
these categories and all these ideas in

186
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,000
the modern technology as well later on

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,599
the other core geolocation and a bit

188
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,520
more Dynamic information that will not

189
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,460
just block by zero one it or more block

190
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,139
about what are you doing maybe it's a

191
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,080
malicious document or or it's a data

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,360
protected document or maybe this

193
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,919
particular website

194
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,500
has a different score based on what we

195
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,560
check for example a Dropbox website that

196
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,840
shares document we have one score but if

197
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,120
again ishare.com may have a different

198
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,819
score even so it's also sharing document

199
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,539
but probably not as reliable as Dropbox

200
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,879
with browser isolation we added even

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,860
more information because I can now

202
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,620
enable browser isolation on potentially

203
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,800
new domains or uncategorized traffic or

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,020
where we don't trust or believe what's

205
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,620
happening and I can also merge and mesh

206
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,419
between all this so for example

207
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,280
if you're going to a website that looks

208
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,319
fishy because it looks like your bank

209
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,099
account and we can present you a logo

210
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,500
that will say this size look fishy but

211
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,960
you still want to go there but now you

212
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,479
want to put your credentials it may not

213
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,979
allow to put your credentials because

214
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,520
the risk of this website is quite High

215
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
or if you even block it as well or will

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,840
not allow you to download or upload

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
files there as well and the last

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,099
category are reality relatively new call

219
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,019
secure browser some people also called

220
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:35,700
Enterprise browser

221
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,880
it's a agent that you download it's a

222
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,860
browser chromium based base to talk

223
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,539
about it later on as well that you don't

224
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,399
allow to your laptop you need to log in

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,380
and you can use it with a similar

226
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,279
functionality on what we so so far

227
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,200
so we're going to talk about four type

228
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
of different solutions browser isolation

229
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,519
the remote part browser security browser

230
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,459
extension and endpoint isolation

231
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,620
technology that still exists but not as

232
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,959
popular as it used to be people try to

233
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:04,980
have

234
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,140
so what is about resolution let's think

235
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,779
about have two examples one when you go

236
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,040
and clean your apartment if you clean

237
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
your apartment or clean something else

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,100
you know for sure you're going to work

239
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,959
with chemicals and you're not really

240
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,640
thinking about which chemicals you're

241
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,959
going to work you know reading the

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,480
labels on every bottle you just probably

243
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,940
putting gloves and just working with the

244
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,620
gloves because you want to be sure

245
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,500
you're protected so this is one example

246
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,140
second example on the left you see a

247
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,420
bomb a person they need to disassemble

248
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,800
the bomb doesn't go and touch it

249
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,380
directly it's using a robot that doing

250
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,959
the work for him remote browser almost

251
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,820
within the same work but we're not

252
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
touching so something happened with the

253
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,060
robot

254
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,160
there's not nothing will happen with the

255
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,560
human hip operating the robot

256
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,320
if we switch and go more technically

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
technologically here we'll see on the

258
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
left we have different browsers any

259
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,300
browsers we want it could be a BYOD or

260
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,660
it could be a corporate device where in

261
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,240
certain technological way it could be a

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,700
client it could be

263
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,279
a proxy file

264
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,100
or different other technique

265
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,980
where we connecting to a remote browser

266
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,440
almost like a remote machine but I don't

267
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,240
want to talk about this right now it's

268
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,399
because it's not a remote machine

269
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,820
that doing the work for us you tagging

270
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,680
your comments and the remote browser

271
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,899
doing all the work for you all the tabs

272
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,060
are separated virtually or

273
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,339
virtualizationally and doing the work if

274
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,019
something happened with the browser over

275
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,579
there it's not happening with your

276
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,660
motion it's happening remotely of course

277
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,360
similar to remote Network Technologies

278
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
like sassy secure OB Gateway or

279
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,339
firewalls you want to be connected in

280
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,800
the fastest ways possible with the

281
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,140
latest latency is possible that you can

282
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,660
have a good experiences if you check

283
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,279
some of the vendors you will see the

284
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,779
technology came to the point that you

285
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,540
can watch YouTube videos you can have

286
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,300
fire clicking in a fireplace you can

287
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,339
play video games because the technology

288
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,459
is very very mature

289
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,599
this is one of the ideas

290
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,420
I do want to show an example of what you

291
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,700
actually see on the left here in a small

292
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,500
and make it bigger in a second we will

293
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,959
see a CNN website and if I make it

294
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,940
bigger you will see there's a lot of

295
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,279
information here and I can scroll down

296
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,040
here probably for for like a minute if I

297
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,500
will analyze CNN website I will see it

298
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,920
has more than 200 links more than 100

299
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,560
different javascripts there

300
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,440
and I'm basically only went to CNN but

301
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
there's so much information in CNN

302
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,800
there's so many links it's going to

303
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,260
scene and and in case you can put like a

304
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,240
method inside the metrics because one

305
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,459
link could go to one another website to

306
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,200
go to another website that potentially

307
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,660
May sorry something malicious overflash

308
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,760
for example

309
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,339
this this is typically what you're gonna

310
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,800
get from a vendor they're doing remote

311
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,920
browser isolation basically one link to

312
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,480
the remote browser and certain

313
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,820
information there as well that's it it's

314
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,399
very simple not a lot of information all

315
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,560
the garbage all unnecessary information

316
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,740
is removed so the chance that you

317
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,660
getting something infected is almost to

318
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,060
zero we cannot say zero but it's a very

319
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,800
very slim

320
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,200
and you can of course definitely also

321
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,139
document work you can it's not just

322
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,880
almost like a video it's actually

323
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,620
interactive you can you you can

324
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,560
manipulate you can work with documents

325
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,880
you are working and with the website

326
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
you're working if you look on the

327
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,940
features lesson attack more on the

328
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,560
features you will see that

329
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,420
there's a lot of similar features to

330
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,279
secure web Gateway but there is also

331
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,380
other features like self document access

332
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,779
for example I can actually access a

333
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,639
document that will be deconstructive

334
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,180
with the remote browser isolation vendor

335
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,680
and you were able to work with this

336
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,060
secure you can even download the

337
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,560
document if you want depend on your

338
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,279
settings or upload the document it will

339
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,800
work also with your IM provider for

340
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,660
single sign-on so you can support the

341
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,459
zero trust you can support access to

342
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,399
only the person that need to have access

343
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,320
and many other interesting things that

344
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,579
you can see here I don't want to read

345
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,839
all of them you can probably do it by

346
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,940
yourself so that will become possible

347
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,480
right now with safe browsing so your

348
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,399
browsing is is the last one because I'm

349
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,320
basically read only I cannot do anything

350
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,079
beside reading this could be good for

351
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,760
contractors as well this could be for

352
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
your remote employees

353
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,339
certain vendors allow you to do this for

354
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,800
the entire traffic certain vendors only

355
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,500
suggest you to do it on uncategorized or

356
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,899
unsafe traffic depend on the vendor of

357
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,120
choice you will choose they will suggest

358
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,100
different things in the beginning when

359
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,519
it started because it was a recess

360
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,500
hungry majority of the vendors only did

361
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,220
it for uncategorized traffic that in my

362
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,860
research was 7 to 15 is because it's 20

363
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,380
of the internet

364
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,699
let's talk about the browser security

365
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:08,699
part this is a brand new category

366
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:11,519
not a lot of vendors there as well I'll

367
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,860
do show the one I know right now I'm not

368
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,120
promoting any of the Avengers just

369
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
providing information they are chromium

370
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,399
based so not Chrome but chromium based

371
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,320
chromium is the Enterprise Edition

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,500
obviously almost open source they took

373
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,079
the base to change the base it's not

374
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,500
just chromium they change many things in

375
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,180
the browser they also created

376
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,860
virtualization and separation between

377
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,959
the tabs the

378
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
basically mandate you to log into the

379
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,160
browser that's why they call the

380
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,779
enterprise browser before you can use it

381
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,880
they support the zero trust idea when

382
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,320
they need to know who you are from where

383
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
you're coming

384
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,120
is interesting part because the browsers

385
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,540
can also do poster check a host Checker

386
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,760
to understand are your corporate device

387
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,800
do you have all the patching do you have

388
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,139
the antivirus or certain other settings

389
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,240
that you want to configure to make sure

390
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,420
to give you access before before you

391
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,040
actually can log in and when you log in

392
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,339
then they can provide access to the

393
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,260
corporate infrastructure that you need

394
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,079
some of them work together with SSL VPN

395
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,480
ztna providers some of them not but

396
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,519
think about this

397
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,459
you need to have access to AWS to do

398
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,920
some sort of changes with this idea

399
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,260
you're not just doing the IEM

400
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,480
authentication and single sign-on you

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
can also mandate from which browsers you

402
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,459
have and to have the browser you need to

403
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,920
download the browser so from somewhere

404
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,540
you need to install it you need to check

405
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,880
that you can use the browser as well so

406
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,100
you are elevating the defense in depth

407
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,440
by a lot this could be also a very good

408
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,420
solution for third party vendors which

409
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,519
is doing work for you or contactors

410
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,940
because in many cases you have an easier

411
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,560
way to control what they can do and how

412
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,839
they can do it now the weight of a

413
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,100
design that you cannot just download

414
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,139
files to their PCS there are certain

415
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,699
protections that happening there as well

416
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,639
to separate this part and create more

417
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,500
acceleration as well very very

418
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,180
interesting category a lot of

419
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,420
interesting things here there's certain

420
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,339
similarity to remote browser isolation

421
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,040
from a feature perspective but there is

422
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,839
also things that are different as well

423
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,579
like the

424
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,300
checking you for you have certain

425
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,160
applications or post to check on your

426
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,100
device it also do a password protection

427
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,160
on the browser so right now if I install

428
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
a software malware on your device and I

429
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
will try to scrap passwords from Edge on

430
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,220
Chrome I'll probably be able to do it

431
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,500
not me person but actually doing this

432
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,839
work with this browser security part

433
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,759
this part is not able to happen because

434
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,459
you have a wall they have a much secure

435
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,139
way to actually

436
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,480
let's say attach password you can also

437
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,779
mandate and figure out which extension

438
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,120
you have or cannot have with this

439
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
technology so it's quite interesting as

440
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,540
well

441
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,480
there is another section that is similar

442
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
to browser security but they use

443
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,740
extension only so you install for some

444
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,780
extension in your browser that will help

445
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,599
you to identify phishing attacks you do

446
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,240
URL filtering as well and do many things

447
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,760
without installing a browser and just

448
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,339
installing the extension so it's also

449
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,380
quite interesting not too many vendors

450
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,660
there as well it could be much easier to

451
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,380
deploy them but they may provide not as

452
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,539
much as functionality as remote browser

453
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,539
resolution or browser security

454
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,059
there was another part that we promised

455
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,039
to discuss and it's called local

456
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,900
endpoint isolation

457
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,700
if you're familiar with bromia from a

458
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,980
couple of years ago they're one of the

459
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,539
main companies was another company there

460
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,940
as well where they basically creating

461
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,100
virtualization as part of your entire

462
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,340
desktop it worked perfectly and was very

463
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,039
good but unfortunately people suffer

464
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,059
from

465
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,700
usability I mean there's a security idea

466
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,160
it was great but my personal experience

467
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
there was a lot of issues of his

468
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,419
usability of his extensions with the

469
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,160
amount of Hardware people needed on

470
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,220
their devices so the idea was great but

471
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,620
it was just very very not usable for day

472
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,380
by day and the user experience was not

473
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,740
degrade right now in my mind we shifted

474
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,720
from this idea there are still certain

475
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,700
vendors that pushing this in a different

476
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,400
ways but I think the browser security

477
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,100
extension and remote browser will be the

478
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,418
key Technologies for this

479
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,260
certain people asked what's the

480
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,720
difference between RBI and remote

481
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,780
desktop and the main part is that the

482
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,840
amount of speed the amount of latency

483
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,580
you want to achieve and the new

484
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,620
technology is using right now

485
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,780
will be very hard to achieve with just

486
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,220
remote desktop or Citrix for example

487
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,160
in certain cases if you watch our

488
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,720
kickoff episode in secret architecture

489
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,000
you will see that a quarter of a second

490
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,760
this is the latency people want this is

491
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,440
what people continued with the eye and

492
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,080
do not get frustrated that's why

493
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,720
the remote desktop Technologies are okay

494
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,520
but they're not going to provide you the

495
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,799
same look and feel depending on what you

496
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,080
do it may be frustrating that's why

497
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,720
having a much personal experience can be

498
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,360
much better

499
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,160
as promised I do want to show who

500
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
playing in the pond as you can see

501
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,140
there's a lot of vendors here on the

502
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,140
slide some of the vendors are very

503
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,240
new vendors and some of them are very

504
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,740
mature they've been here for a very very

505
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,020
long time like men who've been here for

506
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,580
ages of course you know McAfee is

507
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Carrier netscope I was growth point on

508
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,460
the lattice the older RBI vendors on the

509
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,080
right side you can see the new Orlando

510
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,419
Island and Thailand that literally been

511
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,340
around for a couple of months and the

512
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,320
Roman and Vinci is there

513
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,480
a local isolation isolate is still

514
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
around and doing a very interesting work

515
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,480
especially for

516
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,220
Enterprise

517
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,500
dedicated spaces where you need a lot of

518
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,380
segregation and air gapping

519
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,020
but I do believe if there's a lot of

520
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,140
vendors in the industry in the space

521
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,020
it's mean that there is something very

522
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,179
interesting and very relevant happening

523
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,740
in the world

524
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,380
if you do look on the oldest vendors you

525
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,000
will see some similarity and they will

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,860
talk about the similarity very very

527
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,260
quickly and it's called sassy and SSE

528
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,659
majority of the vendors we just saw and

529
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,179
I'm gonna go back for a second

530
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,919
are playing

531
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,220
in the SSC and Sassy space if you're not

532
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,039
familiar with SSC in sassy space secure

533
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
access service edge was defined by

534
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,179
Gardner as a framework 2018.

535
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,940
SSC C2 service edge is a new magic

536
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,799
quadrant that was released in January

537
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,480
and it's quite dominating right now in

538
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,159
the industry

539
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,260
the secure object with the casbians the

540
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,240
ztna are important

541
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,340
the remote browse isolation and the

542
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,260
browser security are playing insecure

543
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,960
Gateway and ztna because I need to log

544
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,320
in and I basically using the part of

545
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,960
inline inspection in the ztna part I

546
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,200
want to provide a remote access secure

547
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,880
remote access from where you're coming

548
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,780
so they're playing their all the vendors

549
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,520
in the space we're going to provide you

550
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,100
some kind of a URL filtering some kind

551
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,860
of protection of what you can do so it's

552
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,780
not going to be just a remote the

553
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,820
Isolation part it's going to be many

554
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,860
other things as well and they're all

555
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,299
going to play in this umbrella so I

556
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,820
think it's important that it is aligned

557
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,380
to this Frameworks this aligned to this

558
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,600
magic quadrons so watch for them and

559
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,880
have a look

560
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,100
important part when you're going to look

561
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,380
and choose majority of this vendor is

562
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,000
going to be as a service it's mean

563
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,320
you're not deploying any hardware

564
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,799
on-prem even so there was earlier models

565
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,460
of on-prem browser isolation I don't

566
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,260
think they're scalable right now

567
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,700
majority of the vendor at least I'm

568
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,440
talking with

569
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,720
are in the cloud it's mean they're

570
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,940
scalable they take care of your version

571
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,220
release so that you shift responsibility

572
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,500
to them they provide and availability

573
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,840
and you Outsourcing it's mean in some

574
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,340
cases if you're removing a lot of

575
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,559
headache from you but you may paying a

576
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,880
bit more money because in our

577
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,220
responsible on all these important stuff

578
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,080
and I'm just looking at my time because

579
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,000
I know we want to leave time for

580
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,240
questions

581
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,039
significant concerns when you choose a

582
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,500
vendor you really want to understand

583
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,600
what is the latency what else they

584
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,059
provide are they aligned back to

585
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,400
everything else you have how the traffic

586
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,380
will be routed remember we spoke about

587
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,200
where is it located so if you are in New

588
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,720
York but the company you're working with

589
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,820
the vendor is in Europe it's mean the

590
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,380
traffic will have to go all the way to

591
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,240
Europe so you really want to ask these

592
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,500
questions when you choose a vendors and

593
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,419
choose an architecture how many problems

594
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,400
you have where is located where the

595
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,679
traffic will be going

596
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,980
I is an architect be very very strongly

597
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,620
believe on alignment on your current

598
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,299
architecture and what's happening with

599
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,760
you inside one of the things you want to

600
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,340
look is if you don't have sanction and

601
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,960
sanctioned apps or you don't know how to

602
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,700
find them you really want to do it

603
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,559
before you go there because

604
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,320
it's going to be very important part of

605
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,140
your entire portfolio and what you're

606
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,760
going to do there as well and of course

607
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,140
the device posture and user

608
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,460
identification

609
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,559
I do want to touch base on monitoring

610
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,600
logging because you may find such

611
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,039
interesting things with these

612
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,600
Technologies for example you have a

613
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,340
vision fishing campaign people may

614
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,380
report on phishing but you can also

615
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,840
figure out from the logs from RBI and

616
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,059
browser security was actually clicking

617
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,200
because you're going to see these things

618
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,080
in in the links and you potentially may

619
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,640
find a lot of interesting information in

620
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,340
the link at you or thinking are safe but

621
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,400
not actually safe trans Behavior device

622
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,919
posture all this past can be monitored

623
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,100
and you can create very good metrics on

624
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,020
your environment what's happening and

625
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,240
not happening and last couple of things

626
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,179
as part of the studio broadcast we are

627
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,880
actually covering RBI and security

628
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,039
browser right now season four so you are

629
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,600
more than welcome to to think we

630
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,980
actually only release our kickoff

631
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,600
episode yesterday we're going to have

632
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,880
majority of the vendors used on a slide

633
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,799
here and it's a good time for us

634
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,100
questions

635
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,340
yeah one sec there's been lots of people

636
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,600
talking about different things in the

637
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,880
chat here I definitely got one question

638
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,600
for you let's just see here uh Toby's

639
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
asking Toby asks um I recall liking PF

640
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,940
blocker quite uh some time back uh PF

641
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,520
sense here too but pie hole has a lot of

642
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,320
very nice functionality to tweak

643
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,360
exceptions on the Fly anything like that

644
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,460
in pf blocker these days

645
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,039
so I'm not sure about PR blocker but pie

646
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,120
hole if I remember correctly it's

647
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,620
dynastic it's more about DNS security

648
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,419
and deep sense of course it's all open

649
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,600
source viral so we're looking more about

650
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,120
yes or no with the browser session about

651
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,500
the security we're looking about much

652
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,360
more dynamic range I can give you access

653
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,340
but I'm not gonna

654
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,860
led the bad information and malware get

655
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,200
to get your device so it's not just zero

656
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,960
yes or no black and white it's more

657
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,900
about isolation and I can let you browse

658
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,580
anywhere you want but I will not let the

659
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,140
bad things happening and coming to you

660
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,419
laptop

661
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,580
that makes sense yeah

662
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,760
um

663
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,480
yeah let's see if there's any more

664
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,279
questions there if there's any uh
