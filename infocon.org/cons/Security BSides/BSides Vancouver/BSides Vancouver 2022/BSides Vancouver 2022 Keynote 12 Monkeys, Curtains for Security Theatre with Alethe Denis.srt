1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,120
all right thank you so much for that

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,200
very kind introduction

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,520
um again we will be

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,719
doing the final keynote for b-sides

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,920
vancouver

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
12 monkeys curtains for security theater

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
a little bit about me i spend a lot of

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,080
my day dealing with clients in a variety

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,560
of different industries and essentially

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,800
what i end up doing is being responsible

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,119
for translating the needs

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,720
of the security team

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
to their executive and decision-making

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
team who have the buying power and the

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
decision-making capabilities for the

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,320
organization

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
i focus on not only blue team compliance

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
assessments risk assessments and risk

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
analysis

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
identification of vulnerabilities in

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,680
people processes and systems but i also

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
get to simulate attacks against those

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
systems and do some red team type

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,320
theatrics

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
phishing and voice fishing over the

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,359
phone smishing or text message fishing

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,120
all the silly fishing names

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
i do those as well

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
and i participate in collaborative

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
engagements that include things like

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
tabletop

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,119
assessments for clients who want to test

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
their response capabilities

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,799
um with a simulated attack um

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,759
so

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
moving on

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
enough about me i would like to thank

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,200
this besides vancouver team for inviting

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,439
me to speak to you today for giving me

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,159
the honor of rounding out the keynotes

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,799
with a closing keynote for the event and

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,799
just recognize all the hard work that

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,600
these individuals put in to

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
organizing putting together managing

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479
hosting and enabling this event to

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,680
happen

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,759
facilitating an event like this is not

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,240
an easy feat so thank you again for the

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
invitation to speak for all the hard

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
work that you put into this and all the

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
other individuals who contributed behind

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,439
the scenes to make this event possible

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,079
our agenda today in curtains for

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,520
security theater

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,399
is pretty simple but we'll get into more

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
of the detail here as we go we're going

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
to talk about an introduction the

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,080
process culture people and then close

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
with some final thoughts i'd like to

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
remind everyone that this is by no means

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,319
enough time for us to go into enough

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
detail i really wanted this talk to

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
focus on

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
sparking a new interest in the audience

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,879
and people who review this talk to

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,120
look further into how they can resolve

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
some of the struggles that we have

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,599
related to what i like to call security

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,360
theater and we'll get into what that is

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
here in just a second so introduction

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
the purpose of security why does

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,440
security exist ultimately security

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
exists to protect people to protect

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
information to protect people and

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
information and a great illustration of

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
that is the campaign that was brought

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
about in world war ii

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
that used propaganda

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
to spread awareness that gossiping and

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
talking about where their loved ones

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,599
were positioned where

82
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,400
resources for the military and people

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
related to the military were positioned

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
could lead to enemies learning of where

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,080
those

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
resources were and then attacking them

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,440
so the idea of security goes

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,319
back to more of this basic need to

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
protect lives to protect people to

90
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
protect information

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
and to keep those things

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
confidential and private

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
for the sake of protecting

94
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,440
rather than simply

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,519
keeping data secret or client personal

96
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,440
identifiable information or health

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
information private we really want to

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
think of security as

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
a means of protecting our population our

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
people our information about those

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,599
people and how security has a real

102
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,360
impact in all of our lives on many

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
levels everything from locking your car

104
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
doors to

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
keeping your home alarmed and secure

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
while you're away

107
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,040
all of those things relate back to

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,160
security and what drives that security

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
is a passion to keep those things safe

110
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,358
and that i think is something that's

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
very important to keep in mind as we

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
progress through this because

113
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
essentially

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
our perception becomes reality and what

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,320
is popular

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
in media and what we see

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
when we learn about security that

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,479
becomes

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,440
the truth or our perception of security

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,560
and sometimes that can be slanted

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
away from its original purpose

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
when we learn about information security

123
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
we learn that it is specific to

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
confidential confidentiality of data and

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
information

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,600
it is

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
related to the integrity of that data

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,520
keeping the data intact and complete and

129
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,199
accurate and our it systems information

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
all of those things operational and

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,080
accessible and available so the

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,720
availability of that data to the members

133
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,479
of our organization

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,800
and our clients to keep our businesses

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
operating to keep us making money all of

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
these things relate back to that

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
security keeping those systems secure

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
keeping that data private

139
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
and a lot of this has been driven by

140
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,560
a need to define a process for

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
business security when we think about

142
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
information security we think mostly

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,199
about business security and not so much

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
the original purpose of security which

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
was to keep

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,600
our information private for the sake of

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
protecting people we think of protecting

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
systems now more in corporate

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
information security

150
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
so related to

151
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,199
a need to define this process

152
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,800
we identify

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
process drivers things that are driving

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
the process behind information security

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,319
in our corporate security programs for

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,720
our businesses

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,199
some of those key process drivers are

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
related to third-party risk management

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,560
these third-party vendor risk management

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
programs have come about

161
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
out of a lot of recent incidents where

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
third-party vendors were used as a means

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
of accessing a corporation or a business

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
through a utility an application

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,120
a piece of hardware or a connection that

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
was made to that

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
victim of that attack

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,319
using a third party that has

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,919
a trusted connection to that business

170
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,800
meaning the attacker used a neutral

171
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
third party and their trust

172
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,240
and access with their target to

173
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
basically

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,160
step stone through them to the target

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,199
and this has really

176
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,880
pushed the development of third party

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,639
risk programs

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,840
in

179
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
corporations and a lot of my clients

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
from basically non-existent to extremely

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
important in the last couple years

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
especially since we've moved to a more

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
distributed workforce and become more

184
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,919
reliant on that remote access to

185
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,400
complete processes updates

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,360
and to connect with each other

187
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
another

188
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,120
metric that has

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
essentially contributed to

190
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,759
this process requirement and information

191
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,039
security is the cyber security insurance

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,520
requirements we've had a multitude of

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
incidents over the last couple years

194
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
especially that have had

195
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,879
claims made with cyber insurance

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
companies that spiked the amount of

197
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
dollars going out of those insurance

198
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,680
companies significantly enough for them

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
to start putting in

200
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
requirements and restrictions on how

201
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,599
claims will be made accepted and

202
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,120
processed

203
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
and so these insurance companies are

204
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
insisting that the companies that they

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,360
insure check a certain number of boxes

206
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
or complete a certain certification or

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
show evidence that they have a competent

208
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
security program

209
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
we also have the corporate audit and

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
compliance frameworks that are being

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
pushed down from corporate levels into

212
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,958
more franchise locations and larger

213
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
organizations that dictate how those

214
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,440
locations are allowed to store transmit

215
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
and process data for example you may

216
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
have one large company with a

217
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,839
headquarters in canada but they have

218
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,519
many branches all over the world that

219
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,440
are subject not only to

220
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
the you know compliance and audit

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
requirements of that state nation

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
province or location but they're also

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
subject to the requirements of their

224
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
corporate headquarters as to how they

225
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
can manage and process their client and

226
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,120
vendor data

227
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
so the solution has become to create

228
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,360
more certifications to create more

229
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
compliance frameworks that are specific

230
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
to different industries specific to

231
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
different areas or business sectors

232
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
it's become this need to certify an

233
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,519
organization as compliant or security

234
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,560
conscious

235
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
rather than examining the culture of the

236
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
company and finding out if they are

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
truly secure in the way that they

238
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
process data transmit and store that

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,839
data

240
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,320
these audits only look at a snapshot in

241
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
time and not the ongoing state of the

242
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,680
security of the organization

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
a company could pass an audit could

244
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
receive um you know compliance against a

245
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
certain framework one day and be

246
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
vulnerable the very next day

247
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,959
so we see this cycle of

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,880
insufficient security

249
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,600
the overlay of the compliance process

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
and this solution to make this company

251
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
more secure then we see analysis and

252
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
assessment and then we revert right back

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
to insufficient security whether it's

254
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
through unpatched applications

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
poor security posture in the defense of

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
things like social engineering phishing

257
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
emails and a variety of different types

258
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
of attacks

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
despite technical technical controls and

260
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,680
compliance that we have in place that

261
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,599
checks the boxes on those frameworks

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,880
so to draw from 12 monkeys

263
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,560
there's this theme that you'll see in my

264
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,240
talk here that we all feel a little

265
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
a little crazy and i think that's

266
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,839
because a lot of us wake up in the

267
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
morning and we go to work and we defend

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
our organizations we defend our clients

269
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,760
we help

270
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
stand things up we create new security

271
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,079
processes we

272
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,320
execute security awareness training we

273
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,600
measure we simulate attacks we analyze

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
data and it seems that the very next day

275
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,079
we have some kind of a breach or an

276
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,920
incident or a situation that hits the

277
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,480
news and we all feel like we're fighting

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
this uphill battle

279
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
where we work and work and work and work

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
and we're not seeing a net result that

281
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
shows that our work is

282
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,120
valid that it's producing a measurable

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,959
um an impactful result and i think that

284
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
that is mainly attributed to the fact

285
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,760
that

286
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,440
real security

287
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,800
is not compliance and compliance cannot

288
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,519
be made to be security

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
a framework can't account for the subtle

290
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,640
nuances of your company its operations

291
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
the environment your people how those

292
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
people interact with each other

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,440
these audits only look at a snapshot in

294
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
time they're not going

295
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
to be able to see the ongoing state of

296
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
your security and

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,839
you know i can demonstrate that i have a

298
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
policy document that says that we do not

299
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
have hold or process any cui or

300
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,959
certified unclassified information

301
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
within a company and meanwhile i can go

302
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,839
look say and do a review of email and

303
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,360
find oh shoot there's a whole bunch of

304
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,120
it all over this company and i had no

305
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
idea i mean we had the policy the policy

306
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
said we didn't do it so i believe that

307
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
we didn't do it but the practice or the

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
process may be different

309
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
um and so sometimes you have these

310
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,600
audits that are maybe not as

311
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
thorough you have folks that are

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
self-assessing you have

313
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,920
um even the most cyber

314
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
resilient organizations that treat

315
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
compliance as a baseline and it's not

316
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
true security

317
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
um so essentially what i'm saying is

318
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,639
compliance in most instances and that is

319
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,600
a blanket statement and a generality

320
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,079
in some cases it can be a wonderful tool

321
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
to measure an excellent program so i'm

322
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,240
not saying that the two are

323
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,200
never

324
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
uh present in an organization and

325
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,519
simultaneously only that you can't rely

326
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
on compliance to create security

327
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,880
what usually ends up happening is i have

328
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
a client that will say okay well

329
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,279
you're telling me that there's a

330
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
recommendation that i should do x y z

331
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
but i'm going to ask you since i only

332
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,880
want to be certified as compliant with

333
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
this framework

334
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,120
does this framework mandate that i have

335
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,079
to do x y z and if it doesn't i don't

336
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,200
care

337
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
that's a problem that's really a

338
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
breakdown in

339
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
the security fundamental purpose of

340
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
protecting data if

341
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
the recommendation from the security

342
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
team or the general best practice from

343
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
the security team is to do xyz for the

344
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,680
sake of protecting people processes

345
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
systems and the client and company data

346
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
then that is what we should be doing but

347
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
what ends up happening is

348
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,519
that

349
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,160
we are simply checking boxes against a

350
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
compliance framework and creating this

351
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
appearance of security and saying that

352
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
everything is fine

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
because we're doing this list of

354
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
controls and we've

355
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,279
you know developed a way that we can

356
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
show that we're doing each of these

357
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
controls whether it's 100 accurate or

358
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
really rooted in a culture of keeping

359
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
the data protected through that control

360
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
is different

361
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,839
and that disconnect in the security

362
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
culture of an organization versus

363
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
compliance and a security program that

364
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
is mapped back purely to compliance

365
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
is fundamentally the problem that i'm

366
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
discussing today and that's what i want

367
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,600
to improve so we've talked about

368
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,440
what security is what really a passion

369
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,279
for security looks like it's protecting

370
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
people it's protecting information and

371
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,600
it's protecting companies data their

372
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,399
clients vendor and company

373
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,800
intellectual property data

374
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
and having a passion for doing that and

375
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,079
i think that is

376
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,920
why so many of us originally came to

377
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
this field why we got involved in

378
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
security it was that passion

379
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
to protect data and people

380
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
who are at the root of all of these

381
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
organizations and who stand to suffer

382
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
the most if that security is not in

383
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,320
place and what's happened over time is

384
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
that that passion has been eroded by the

385
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,519
process and the creation of these

386
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,800
frameworks for security compliance

387
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,560
so what do we need to do

388
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,920
essentially

389
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,399
we need to fix the culture

390
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
behind security

391
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,440
and get the buy-in and investment from

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,720
the top down in all of our organizations

393
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,639
it feels to me

394
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
and this is my personal opinion

395
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,839
only

396
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
that most of the clients i speak to

397
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
their security teams have been siloed

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,800
away from the rest of the population and

399
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,399
they don't feel like they are being

400
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,199
heard like they are being understood or

401
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,600
listened to by the folks who are making

402
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
the decisions about where the investment

403
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
financial or otherwise is going to

404
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,759
happen within the organization

405
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,720
and

406
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,440
what i love about my job is i get to

407
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,079
bridge that gap i get to take the people

408
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
who feel like they've been locked away

409
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,399
in a corner to protect the organization

410
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,399
in the dark with their keyboards

411
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,440
and

412
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,759
i get to bring their

413
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,759
wants and desires and their passion to

414
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,759
secure their systems and protect their

415
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,240
businesses to light and i get to give

416
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,000
that

417
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
validity through issuing a report that

418
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
says that this is important and

419
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,480
typically what i'm doing is just

420
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
restating what the security team has

421
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
already known to be

422
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
the main or primary issues for this

423
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
organization that will help and enable

424
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,040
them to better protect

425
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,639
what they have

426
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
been tasked with protecting for the

427
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
organization

428
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,040
you can have

429
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,839
this incredible security program

430
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
you can have the policies

431
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
long detailed beautiful

432
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
styled letterheaded

433
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,640
gorgeous branded policies along with

434
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,199
aspirational procedures that say exactly

435
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
how all of your information data and

436
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,000
assets and ip are going to be

437
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,119
stored delivered handled

438
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,959
transacted you can have all of these

439
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
things in place along with the practice

440
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
and have all of your people

441
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,119
trained aware of the practice aware of

442
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,600
the policy aware of the procedure

443
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,240
and you can still be missing that

444
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
security culture

445
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,919
that uh drive that passion

446
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,679
and the buy-in of everyone at the

447
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
company to behave as a team and

448
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,840
essentially create this

449
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,280
masterful puzzle with each person

450
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
playing their part and acting as a piece

451
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,039
in that puzzle of the organization to

452
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,360
form a wall and protect this data and

453
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,120
information

454
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
to make these systems

455
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
available to protect the integrity of

456
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,039
the information

457
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,039
and to secure

458
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,520
all of the hardware software business

459
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,320
systems and other processes linked to

460
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,160
making the

461
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,840
company function and be able to do

462
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,240
business so how do we

463
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,440
fix that how do we

464
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
remedy that and

465
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
essentially marry these two sides of the

466
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,000
equation find the security culture and

467
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
then marry that with this amazing

468
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
compliance framework

469
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
um supported security program

470
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
what it really boils down to

471
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
in essence

472
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,000
is people

473
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,280
and people are going to be at the core

474
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
of pretty much everything that we do

475
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
um

476
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,520
and so why not get their buy-in

477
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
i've heard some incredible talks today

478
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,919
i've heard people talk about

479
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,120
um

480
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,640
systems that hold up our infrastructure

481
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,679
and how these systems can be breached

482
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,400
and how they can be protected i've heard

483
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,280
people talk about creating security

484
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,360
awareness training programs and how to

485
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
get the user

486
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
and executive

487
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,600
and

488
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,880
middle and management buy-ins from an

489
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
organization to make that security

490
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
awareness training

491
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,720
adopted

492
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,320
and engaged with by the employees i've

493
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,120
heard

494
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
just some

495
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,720
absolutely incredible talks about

496
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,960
adversaries and threats

497
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
and ways that we can protect and defend

498
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
our organizations and i think all of

499
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,679
these different facets

500
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,280
of security work together and it is so

501
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
important for us

502
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,760
as security professionals to understand

503
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
that we each have

504
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
our part to play

505
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,280
in this we each have our own specialty

506
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
and through working together

507
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
we can show the rest of our

508
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
organizations people who don't really

509
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,039
think about security and who haven't

510
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,919
been tasked or or made responsible for

511
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,120
security

512
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
what's going to happen if we don't

513
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,039
change this culture

514
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,480
breakdown within our organizations

515
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,760
um from 12 monkeys there's a line about

516
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,640
cassandra in greek legend

517
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
you'll recall she was condemned to know

518
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,159
the future

519
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,280
but to not be believed when she foretold

520
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,080
it

521
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
hence the agony of foreknowledge

522
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,559
combined with the impotence to do

523
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,480
anything about it

524
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
and what that means is she knew what was

525
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
going to happen in the future she would

526
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
tell anyone and everyone who would

527
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,919
listen nobody would believe her and she

528
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
was left with this agony of knowing

529
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
where things were headed

530
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,640
but not having a way to do something

531
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
about that

532
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,640
a way to shift

533
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,600
this perception that she was wrong

534
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,400
and to make people understand that what

535
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,039
she was saying was in fact true and i

536
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
think we're all kind of in that boat um

537
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
i mean correct me if i'm wrong i can't

538
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
see the chat right now but i'm sure

539
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,679
you'll let me know at the end

540
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,720
but

541
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,559
we all feel like we're constantly

542
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
screaming at a wall telling everyone who

543
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
will listen what's going to happen if we

544
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
don't protect this system or handle this

545
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
process differently or adopt this new

546
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
method this new best best practice um

547
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,080
you know patch this system upgrade this

548
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,760
hardware

549
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,200
get new software uh dispense with old

550
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,520
vulnerable software we all know

551
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
and i'm sure you can think of it right

552
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,440
now the top three things that you would

553
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
change in your organization or for your

554
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,000
clients right now you know what those

555
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,679
things are and you feel like you're

556
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
saying it over and over and over and

557
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
everybody just goes aha and they don't

558
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,200
actually believe you

559
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
about how severe the problem could be

560
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,679
if we don't

561
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,760
rectify that and mitigate that

562
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,559
vulnerability

563
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,480
so the definition of insanity

564
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
doing the same thing over and over and

565
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
expecting different results now this

566
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,080
quote is often attributed to a couple

567
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,559
different people and frankly a large

568
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
number of people who probably never said

569
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
it so i don't know who to attribute it

570
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
to but it's kind of true

571
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,760
we keep falling back to this position

572
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,640
of

573
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,840
wanting

574
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,760
to use a process to create the security

575
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,480
that we need for our organizations we

576
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
want to find a framework that's the

577
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
magic answer like if i can take all 20

578
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,640
of these boxes

579
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
you know with three to five sub controls

580
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
on each one of them like this will be

581
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,120
the answer and now i'm secure

582
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
and it's really just not the case

583
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,520
i think it's fantastic that we have all

584
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,640
of these um you know tremendous leaps

585
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,320
and bounds that we've taken with

586
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,200
technical security controls and means of

587
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
mitigating a lot of these types of

588
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
attacks and avoiding

589
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,559
um having our staff and our co-workers

590
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,679
dealing with having to defend against um

591
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,640
a lot of the volume of phishing emails

592
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
and other

593
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,280
types of attacks that typically target

594
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
folks within an organization

595
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
i think those are fantastic and i'm not

596
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
at all saying that we shouldn't use

597
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
those technical controls and those

598
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,360
capabilities and monitoring

599
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,000
and alerting and all those things to the

600
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
fullest

601
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,280
but what i am saying is

602
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
we can't just say that we ticked 10

603
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,679
boxes on a framework and that we're

604
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,799
secure

605
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,120
without really looking

606
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,559
at ourselves and at the culture security

607
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,080
wise within our organizations and doing

608
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
something to get the buy-in and i know

609
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
you're like okay well what's the thing

610
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,679
i've got to do

611
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,320
it's really different it's different for

612
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
a lot of organizations

613
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
i don't know the culture of your

614
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,039
you know nation

615
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,760
your region your province your state

616
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,679
your city your town it may all be

617
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,000
different what will encourage people's

618
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
buy-in in some areas won't help make a

619
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
difference in others

620
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,600
but it really comes down to

621
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,679
continuing to try

622
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,840
that

623
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,440
persistence that

624
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,679
drive in that effort

625
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,760
you can't have one security awareness

626
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,159
training and do one fishing test

627
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
and know where you are

628
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,120
you can't

629
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
execute

630
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,440
a one-time plan to you know check all

631
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
the things in a compliance framework and

632
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,159
say yeah we're good you know we're

633
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,720
eternally fine because back in you know

634
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
2010 we checked all the boxes on this

635
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,960
and everything was fine and we're doing

636
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,279
everything the same way so it's okay

637
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
it really takes this

638
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,480
constant work and effort and continued

639
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
uh

640
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,840
trial and error to determine what is

641
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,679
going to be the thing

642
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,640
that

643
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,679
helps people to understand

644
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,919
how this can impact them

645
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,960
not just in their daily lives at work

646
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,159
but in their daily lives in total

647
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,200
and

648
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
choosing the right

649
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
humans for the job is very important in

650
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,799
inspiring that security culture

651
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,799
so to encourage

652
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,400
that

653
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,799
creation of the security culture within

654
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,720
your organization

655
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,799
i want you to think about both your

656
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,559
existing and your emerging workforce not

657
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,279
only related to security but in general

658
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,440
i want you to think about encouraging

659
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,720
innovation

660
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,760
hiring or encouraging the individuals

661
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,799
that you have on staff already

662
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,960
to use critical thinking skills and go

663
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,000
beyond simple process docs

664
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,120
to study adversarial tactics and learn

665
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,360
about how to defend against those and

666
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,039
new threats

667
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,159
to go to continued education to attend

668
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,840
conferences to

669
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,919
seek certifications that they find

670
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,840
interesting and relevant to their jobs

671
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
or completely irrelevant if it's just

672
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
something that is security adjacent

673
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
maybe to their position but that they

674
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
find very

675
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,960
enjoyable to learn more about and

676
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,320
understand

677
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,640
to foster environments where you have

678
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,760
collaboration and sharing of ideas and

679
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,279
support for that

680
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,200
that will ultimately contribute to

681
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,400
innovation within your security program

682
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
to review the requirements in your job

683
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,039
descriptions

684
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,279
make sure that you are evaluating the

685
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,080
whole candidate that you are reducing

686
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,000
the education and experience

687
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
requirements to the bare minimum

688
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,159
and then maybe list some nice to haves

689
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,840
if you have some other certification or

690
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,880
educational requirements that you would

691
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,159
love to see in your unicorn ideal

692
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,000
candidate

693
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,679
make sure that you're not leaving

694
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,520
potential candidates

695
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
feeling like they shouldn't even apply

696
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,400
if maybe they have some other real life

697
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,799
experiences and other skills that could

698
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
compensate for that lack in education or

699
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,120
experience

700
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,080
offer

701
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,440
non-wage compensation especially related

702
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,000
to work flexibility there are a lot of

703
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,399
jobs that can be performed

704
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,520
at a not a set shift that will allow

705
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,760
people to have more flexibility in how

706
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
they balance their work and their lives

707
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
to have that

708
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,080
perfect balance struck between work and

709
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,520
life

710
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
so that they can you know take care of

711
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,000
family or friends as well as attend to

712
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,679
their own personal

713
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,399
um priorities and make sure that their

714
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,120
work gets done you can measure

715
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,640
most humans effort through their work

716
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,039
product and not simply their

717
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,440
green dot availability

718
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,320
status on a messenger application or

719
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,919
something like that

720
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,039
invest in your candidate pipeline

721
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
what i mean by this is

722
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,679
find programs that create

723
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,279
amazing security people find programs

724
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,960
that invest in

725
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
things like

726
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
capture the flag competitions not just

727
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,000
for hacking but other security related

728
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,080
areas that focus on innovation and

729
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
um

730
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,919
people who are inquisitive and

731
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,799
who

732
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
lift those people up and give them an

733
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,559
opportunity to learn more about

734
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,559
information security and participate in

735
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,039
programs like pisces which is something

736
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,279
that critical insight

737
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,120
puts a lot of effort into and i'm happy

738
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
to share the details of that following

739
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,720
this talk if anyone's curious but

740
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,880
essentially we help college students to

741
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
get into the industry um using our

742
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
pisces program

743
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
look for programs in your area that do

744
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
similar things so that you can find

745
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,360
those folks who are most passionate

746
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,919
about security because the folks that

747
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,840
you find who are

748
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
the most passionate will have a much

749
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,880
better chance of creating that culture

750
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
of security and buy-in from people at

751
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
all levels within your organization

752
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,600
encourage diversity through embracing

753
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,279
unique perspectives

754
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,760
uh trusting your employees to complete

755
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,279
their work i mentioned that a little bit

756
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,360
earlier measure folks

757
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
based on their work output and their

758
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,039
work product and the quality of that

759
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,919
product rather than simply

760
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,919
you know hours in a day or being

761
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,279
available

762
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,360
increase your opportunities for a

763
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
variety of work types and what i mean by

764
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,360
that is part-time full-time remote fully

765
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
remote

766
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,039
wherever that's possible make that an

767
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,000
option

768
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,840
um you don't want to limit your

769
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,159
candidate pool just to your specific

770
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,720
geographical area if you can avoid it

771
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
because you can source talent from all

772
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,799
over the globe if you're motivated to do

773
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,000
so

774
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,559
then foster that security mindset within

775
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,000
your entire team

776
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,640
you play as a team you operate as a team

777
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,200
you win as a team you lose as a team

778
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,080
don't single people out mentor teammates

779
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,960
maybe have more experienced teammates

780
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,159
mentor those who are newer or emerging

781
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,200
workforce candidates

782
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,039
also make sure that you have cross

783
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,880
training and the ability for people

784
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
within different teams to learn new

785
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,120
skills from their co-workers and share

786
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,559
that knowledge so that you don't get

787
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,080
stuck in that rut

788
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,320
of tribal knowledge where you know just

789
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
one small pocket of the company is aware

790
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,120
of a process or how systems work or just

791
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,080
one individual knows how to operate

792
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,159
maintain or

793
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,600
handle things within a specific

794
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,960
application or system or process

795
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,679
encourage transparency throughout your

796
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,720
teams empower your people to speak share

797
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,919
their minds without judgment

798
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,039
suspend your own judgment of others

799
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,760
reward new ideas

800
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,159
you want to give people a space where

801
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,000
they feel like they are valued where

802
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,279
they can share their ideas where their

803
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,679
perspectives are taken seriously

804
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,519
and where their recommendations are

805
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,919
thoroughly evaluated

806
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,320
in conclusion

807
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,240
there's this uh

808
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,440
the sentiment from 12 monkeys where

809
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
james cole is saying that you know the

810
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,360
human race is just asking to be wiped

811
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,640
out

812
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,960
and jeffrey gohan says wiping out the

813
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
human race that's a great idea that's

814
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,840
great

815
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,399
but more of a long-term thing i mean

816
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
first we have to focus on some more

817
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,080
immediate goals

818
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,720
and i think we all get overwhelmed by

819
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
the big picture

820
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
we all get slightly discouraged and

821
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,880
overwhelmed when we think of how far we

822
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,080
have to go

823
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,519
and i really want to encourage you to

824
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,399
look at this short term to look at your

825
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,399
daily goals your weekly goals your

826
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,480
monthly goals and then maybe start

827
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,799
projecting outwards towards the years

828
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,240
and the three years and the five year

829
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,720
plans it gets really overwhelming when

830
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,240
you look at a three or five year road

831
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,399
map and just go i cannot do all this

832
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,760
this is insane it is insane

833
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
so bite off one little chunk at a time

834
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,480
start standing up your frameworks your

835
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,840
processes

836
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,159
and start measuring

837
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,000
what you've completed each week i start

838
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,159
every week writing out a task list i

839
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,159
would show it to you but i can't

840
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,720
and essentially it's on a post-it note

841
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,960
to the right of my mouse and it just

842
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
says you know this is the client this is

843
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,640
the thing i have to do this week client

844
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,720
thing client thing client thing and for

845
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
you maybe it's application thing

846
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,960
application thing and you set this list

847
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,039
of things out for the week and you knock

848
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,880
out one of those things per day and

849
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,120
you'll start to feel that sense of

850
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,279
accomplishment and an achievement and at

851
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,519
the end you take a post-it that has all

852
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,760
the things and you physically cross it

853
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,880
out

854
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,679
and just that that manual tactical

855
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,919
physical being able to cross it off

856
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,440
really does a lot

857
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
just psychologically to help you feel

858
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
like you've made some progress

859
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,720
because a lot of us stare at the same

860
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,120
screen using the same mouse and keyboard

861
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,799
all day long and it just feels like it

862
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,519
looks exactly the same every day

863
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,120
so try to make your goals more

864
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,559
bite-sized

865
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,760
try to set out a framework that reduces

866
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,159
things down to the daily weekly monthly

867
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,519
level and tackle one week's worth of

868
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,159
things at a time

869
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,399
try to delegate as much as you can and

870
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
if you're being delegated to

871
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,279
don't hesitate to push back if something

872
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,000
is not going to meet a deadline if you

873
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,279
need to

874
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,960
for your mental health your work life

875
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
balance your flexibility ability

876
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
to

877
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
function and be productive

878
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,679
don't be afraid to ask for help to push

879
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,960
deadlines out to create more realistic

880
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,200
expectations of yourself and your team

881
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,279
and communicate those effectively to

882
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,799
leadership management c-suite

883
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,279
all of that will help to not only keep

884
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,800
you on track

885
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,719
but also to make sure that the

886
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,118
expectations are managed appropriately

887
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
so

888
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,679
the future of workplace security i

889
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,679
believe that the future of workplace

890
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,960
security is human

891
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,599
it's going to start with the people that

892
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,119
we put in

893
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,399
the position

894
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,679
of creating these training programs of

895
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,520
getting the buy-in

896
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,320
of you know top all the way down from

897
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,040
everyone on the team to participate and

898
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,960
to engage in our security practices that

899
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,480
are mapped out and framed out by these

900
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,079
frameworks and policies and the

901
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,399
procedures that support them

902
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,680
it's going to take real human investment

903
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,480
to

904
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,520
stress the culture over the compliance

905
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,480
for the individuals who really only care

906
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,440
ultimately about themselves

907
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,280
most people are going to do

908
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,000
what is in their best interest and

909
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,359
empowering someone to believe

910
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,680
that what's good for the company is in

911
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
their best interest

912
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
is what comes down what it comes down to

913
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,680
when we're talking about creating this

914
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
culture

915
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
you want to have

916
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,119
people who want to support your clients

917
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,680
your vendors your company and be a part

918
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,880
of that team that is actively engaged in

919
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,079
fighting

920
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,720
the adversarial threats in defending the

921
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,560
systems and the data

922
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,680
and uh you know buying in to this

923
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
culture of security

924
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,560
and

925
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,320
creating that culture

926
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,400
fundamentally comes down to

927
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,079
understanding people

928
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,839
and processes

929
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,119
and behavior and how we can shape mold

930
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,680
and influence that through leadership

931
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,839
from our positions within the security

932
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,160
team

933
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,480
so oh wouldn't it be great if i was

934
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,839
crazy then the world would be okay

935
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,960
we all kind of have our little spot in

936
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,880
the security universe and some days we

937
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,400
can feel like we're absolutely losing it

938
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,480
and if we were crazy and the rest of the

939
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
world was fine then everything would be

940
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,280
okay but i think the truth of the matter

941
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,480
is we're all a little crazy for a reason

942
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,240
and our passion really boils down to

943
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,400
keeping our companies our organizations

944
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
and our people safe

945
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,280
and to do that we need to find what

946
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
makes us passionate about security and

947
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,280
remind ourselves why we got into this

948
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,040
mess to begin with

949
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,760
and that comes down to what we talked

950
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,400
about at the very start of this talk

951
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,119
and that is protecting people protecting

952
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,240
lives

953
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,079
in a lot of organizations that i work

954
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,760
with they are literally protecting lives

955
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,880
of people in hospitals and clinics

956
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,960
um and so

957
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,839
i want you to take a moment today

958
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,240
just to review everything that you saw

959
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,599
here today

960
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,480
and yesterday at besides vancouver

961
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,400
what are you passionate about what

962
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,480
brought you to security you don't need

963
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,599
to tell me

964
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,599
but jot yourself down a little list of

965
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,440
things that you think

966
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,640
brought you here and what you're

967
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,000
passionate about

968
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,839
and try to figure out how you can walk

969
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,599
into work

970
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,599
even if it's walking three steps from

971
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,359
your bed to your desk tomorrow and

972
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,000
find that passion in what you do every

973
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,880
day

974
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,359
again

975
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
and that's a wrap for me so i will move

976
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,599
it over to questions these are the ways

977
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,520

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,760
been your oh hang on a sec i got two

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,040
uh what's been your biggest challenge

1034
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,800
my biggest challenge um well let's see

1035
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,560
it related to security my biggest

1036
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,760
challenge for my clients really has been

1037
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,280
expressing

1038
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,320
um

1039
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,200
that we can't rely 100 percent on

1040
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,680
technical controls to keep us safe

1041
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,800
and i don't know if you picked it up

1042
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
from the theme of my talk but

1043
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,640
if something is a best practice and

1044
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
security and not specifically required

1045
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
by the framework they're trying to get

1046
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,040
audited or certified against doing it is

1047
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
the smart thing that's my biggest

1048
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
challenge is communicating why and

1049
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,560
getting that investment

1050
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,520
