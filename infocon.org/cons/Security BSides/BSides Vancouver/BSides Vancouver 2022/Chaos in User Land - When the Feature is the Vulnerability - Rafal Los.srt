61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
bit

62
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,439

recording we're going to cut and chop

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
this all up it'll be a lot cleaner the

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,599
this banter won't be on the the stream

69
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
on uh on the youtube that we'll put it

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
on later but everyone who's here right

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
now they're they're they're seeing and

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
hearing us so don't say anything bad uh

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,520
my video there you go your video is

74
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
awesome you look looking good you're

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
sounding good um your presentation looks

76
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
good so i think we're gonna be all set

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
to go here uh

78
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
i am watching in two different screens

79
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,239
because i got you here in the back end

80
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,080
so i can chat with you and and and the

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,959
stream

82
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,280
um but i'm also on the front end live so

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
i can see the people we're a little

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
delayed on the front end so that way i

85
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
can at least get questions and and get

86
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
them to you um but like i said what i

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
will be doing is i'll be dropping off

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
once we're ready to rock here

89
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,519
i'm still here but i'm just not uh

90
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,800
we had a little hiccup in the first one

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
there where the broadcast died from just

92
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
a moment and then yeah i saw that

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
so i have no idea what happened but um

94
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
i'm sure

95
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
the gremlins and the wire will figure it

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
all out so

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
okay with that in play i think we're

98
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,400
ready to rock and roll if you are

99

that on the linkedin page look up down

131
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,079
the security rabbit hole podcast i'll be

132
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
there this talk is called chaos in user

133
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
land when the feature is the

134
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
vulnerability um

135
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,800
i have spent a lot of years in various

136
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
parts and disciplines within apsec

137
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
i claim to be a master of none of them

138
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
but this one comes from the apsec land

139
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
i've recently had a chance to venture

140
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
back into this world primarily because

141
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
there is this like uh

142
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
magical layer eight of the uh

143
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,800
of the osi model a few people talk about

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
and that's uh leadership and budget so

145
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
let's dive right in apparently my arrow

146
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
key doesn't work so i have to use my all

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
right i'll do this in three parts first

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
one is what's the problem second one is

149
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
how do they get there third is now what

150
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
now what right so

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,440
uh feel free please uh uh ask questions

152
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
in uh in the channel

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
i'm sure they can interrupt me

154
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
have no issues with that

155
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
um

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
and so what is the problem what are bad

157
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,039
features

158
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,960
otherwise known as vulnerabilities well

159
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,880
i think the first question really that

160
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,479
we have to start with the premise of is

161
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,080
what exactly is a feature and

162
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
there's it can be one of many things uh

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
features are generally speaking uh

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,280
something that is required right so it

165
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
it's something new that wants to be

166
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
there's two sources of them as far as i

167
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
can tell that are generically speaking

168
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,680
across the um

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
the universe and the first one is

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
customer requirements for those of you

171
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
that build software or or product uh for

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
the customer space customer will want

173
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
something they say i wish it could do

174
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
this or that and somebody says hey

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
they're paying for this let's go ahead

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
and build it the second option

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,039
is an idea or an innovation so you've

178
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,160
got a

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
a bunch of

180
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
people sitting around a room

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,039
generally these are engineers they go

182
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,759
wouldn't it be cool if and suddenly the

183
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,560
if thing happens

184
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
this is generally the more dangerous one

185
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
because wouldn't it be cool if

186
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,440
uh typically results in fun mayhem as

187
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
you'll see in a little bit but

188
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
so let's talk about this the second

189
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,960
premise is what exactly is a

190
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
vulnerability well you guys are in

191
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,240
postsec you know what that is but a

192
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
little bit of reflection a vulnerability

193
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
really is

194
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,280
a it comes down to a couple of things

195
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,160
it's a flaw in air or an error that

196
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
causes

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
weakness in the system that's that you

198
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
can exploit potentially right to do bad

199
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,639
things

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,520
or

201
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
if you bear with me things that you

202
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,960
probably shouldn't have been able to do

203
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
in the first place

204
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
and that's where this talk and that's

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
where this conversation gets kind of fun

206
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
so what exactly is the difference

207
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
between a feature and a vulnerability

208
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,120
well they you'd think they were pretty

209
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
obvious except sometimes

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
that's not so much the case can

211
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
something be both

212
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,400
and sadly the answer to that is yes more

213
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
often times than you guys will probably

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
want to admit

215
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
uh and in the comments in the chat

216
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
windows here if you've ever run into one

217
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,639
of these uh just you know i don't know

218
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
wave or say something uh that that lets

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
me know but i'm pretty sure every one of

220
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
us at some point in our careers has

221
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
encountered something that say hey

222
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
that's really cool but uh

223
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
that's awful at the same time so

224
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,479
i will give you a couple of examples and

225
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
you're welcome

226
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
something and uh so a couple of examples

227
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
uh you'll recognize some of these

228
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
uh and uh there it would be really fun

229
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
if you would uh as i give the generic

230
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
version if you have your hands on

231
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,280
keyboard ready type out what it is so

232
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,479
the first one

233
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
remember when you could upload css

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
unfettered to a webpage to make cool

235
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
things anybody remember what that was

236
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
called

237
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,840
anybody

238
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,479
there you go remember tom on myspace

239
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,440
yeah

240
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
that was awesome you know what the

241
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,479
result of that was

242
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
you guys remember the samuel worm from

243
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
our friend sammy cam car that uh yes

244
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,919
that was a uh that was a good time

245
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
sadly uh once that happened people sort

246
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
of went wait i could do this kind of

247
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
thing on all over the web and

248
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
hilarious mayhem ensued what about

249
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
javascripted pdfs

250
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,279
you think that was a customer feature or

251
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,039
you think there was some a bunch of uh

252
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
developers sitting around and going you

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,120
know be really cool if um

254
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
i got to tell you i wish i was in it had

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
a a magical machine that i get into

256
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
um that would take me to that point in

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
time because there are some words i'd

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,920
like to have

259
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
as a security practitioner uh what about

260
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
the one-click buy does anybody remember

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
this one this is a big deal

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
close to almost a decade ago now

263
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
anybody remember

264
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,080
so the one-click buy it was the famous

265
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,120
thing uh chris shifflet i think was the

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
discoverer of this in amazon and like a

267
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
year goes by and they're like it's no

268
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
big deal

269
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
but you could literally

270
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
buy a bunch of hidden data in a form

271
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
have somebody click a button and buy

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
things for you and have it shipped to

273
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,480
your house all with no intervention it

274
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
was brilliant until it wasn't

275
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
uh website file uploads

276
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,800
um yeah these are these are a fantastic

277
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
idea random upload random code to a

278
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,839
website random files to a website no big

279
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,800
deal there right every website ever that

280
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
that asks you for

281
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,880
uh to identify yourself and ask have you

282
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,680
upload a profile picture of yourself

283
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
can you upload scripts can you upload

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,680
very very very large multi-terabyte uh

285
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,640
gif files i don't know try to find out

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,519
so all these crazy thing is all these at

287
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,760
some point were a fantastic idea

288
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
somebody said you know what it'd be

289
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,399
really cool

290
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,720
uh on this boring social media page if

291
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
you allow people to personalize it you

292
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
know i should let people personalize it

293
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
let's let's add let them do a cascading

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
style sheets inserts because it's cool

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
it allows you to create flashing you

296
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
know uh marquees it allows you do all

297
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
kinds of things and what's the worst

298
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,439
that could happen

299
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,760
right what's the worst that could happen

300
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
so

301
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
these were all good ideas but something

302
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
along the way went wrong

303
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
so so

304
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,440
horribly horribly wrong

305
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
um

306
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
terribly wrong and

307
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
it's it's strange because you if you

308
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
start to think about how we got like how

309
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
we go from really good idea

310
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,399
to

311
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,160
really bad outcome

312
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
uh it's not a it's not a bad it's not a

313
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,279
terribly long stretch of of uh chasm to

314
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,519
cross and so how did some of this

315
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,079
manifest okay uh how did we build

316
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,480
invulnerabilities completely

317
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
by accident

318
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
and so

319
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
this is the i most people would say well

320
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
this is simple right i mean it's quite

321
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
easy duh it's the developer's fault i

322
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,480
mean

323
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
what kind of

324
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
insert derogatory phrase person would do

325
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
something like this and the answer is

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
all of them

327
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
all of you all of us who have done these

328
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
things right we have thought uh a

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
wonderful feature you know um we've all

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,320
well maybe not all of us uh at some

331
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
point in in uh in life thought hey

332
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,720
i could uh put my key under the mat

333
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
while i'm going away for the day and a

334
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,720
friend of mine can come over and easily

335
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
uh you know get in uh meanwhile the

336
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
stranger that walked by that watched you

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
do that now suddenly has a great place

338
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
way into your place right so blaming

339
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,920
developers is fun and easy uh but it if

340
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,240
you've never seen this graphic i keep

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
this around for all these uh all these

342
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,079
types of talks is i'll give you a second

343
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,839
to kind of pitch through it um

344
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
i i like tyler puts in hey let's

345
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
integrate this browser with os

346
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
components to make it easier to do stuff

347
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
yeah awesome idea super powerful

348
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
somebody just uh i think i just saw

349
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
something about um

350
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,160
python being integrated into uh the web

351
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,880
browser to allow you to script python in

352
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
with os commands what's the worst that

353
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
could happen i mean that sounds like a

354
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
fantastic idea

355
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
but if you've gotten a chance to read

356
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,079
this this slide right it's it's really

357
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
interesting in how you think about this

358
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,760
because if you've never played that game

359
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,200
where you sit back to back with somebody

360
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,920
you you have your own pad and pencil uh

361
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
and you are asked to sketch something

362
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,440
out by a third party and then you turn

363
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
around and you swap drawings and you go

364
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,399
how the heck did you get there the other

365
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
person goes that's weird why would you

366
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,200
draw that that's how we got there okay

367
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
it's not quite that simple it's not as

368
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
simple as blame because

369
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
if you think about creative misuse which

370
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,519
is basically the job title of anybody

371
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,839
that's in this industry right we are

372
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
we do creative misuse

373
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,320
we look at how something is meant to

374
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
function and then we go

375
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
yeah so what happens if you

376
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
and insert fun thing here creative

377
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,839
misuse is a

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
really interesting way to get from

379
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
really cool feature to oh my god we blew

380
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
up the internet in like seven seconds

381
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,079
case in point

382
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,440
so

383
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,839
on one hand we have really good intent

384
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,279
on the other hand we have really bad

385
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,880
outcome and they say the road to hell is

386
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
paved with good intentions

387
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,079
otherwise known as really interesting

388
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,639
features okay and if you think about

389
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
some of the really bad things that have

390
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,360
gone on that were complete accidents

391
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,240
like things that are put in log4j uh

392
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
these things that were put into the

393
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
browser things that were put into

394
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,519
applications

395
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
um where somebody said this is a really

396
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
good idea

397
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
and yeah it's probably a really good

398
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,440
idea but it's also a terrible terrible

399
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
vulnerability it's gonna allow bad

400
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
things to happen and

401
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
both of those can be true at the same

402
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
time so

403
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,639
you guys

404
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,760
know if you know what's going on right

405
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
now with netflix uh they're having this

406
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,800
issue where they are uh there's

407
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
thousands of people sharing sharing

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
profiles and potentially tens of

409
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,519
thousands and hundreds of thousands if

410
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,040
you believe them so

411
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
netflix pro netflix profiles it used to

412
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
be you log in netflix and it was

413
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,279
you know you you watched and it kept

414
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
track of you and all that and they went

415
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,600
you know what if there's like multiple

416
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
people living in the house

417
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,120
um

418
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,399
jackson i was promised no one would

419
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,839
mention log4j sorry wrong talk uh

420
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,320
netflix had these profiles uh

421
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,600
in that

422
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
uh you could you know like your kids

423
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,360
could have their own profile so they

424
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,279
would recommend things they like your

425
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,920
significant other you which was awesome

426
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
until people went hey

427
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
that's cool i can give like seven of my

428
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,320
friends

429
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
uh profiles and my password and we can

430
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,880
all watch what we want it'll keep track

431
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,120
of all our things so the feature is

432
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
multiple profiles what a fantastic idea

433
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,399
a great innovation and it's by the way

434
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,000
it has been copied uh on on just about

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
like disney's done it

436
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
amazon's done it paramount's done it

437
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
you can tell how many streaming services

438
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,519
i signed up for but all of them have

439
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
done it at some point

440
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
now um

441
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
uh if now the outcome of that is happy

442
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,360
family of users and yay congratulations

443
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
but also password sharing

444
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
ergo uh netflix netflix has an issue

445
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
because one person pays like 12 people

446
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
can watch

447
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,560
yeah uh that tends to that tends to be a

448
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,120
revenue problem um

449
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
so the developer says hey look this is

450
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
working as intended right

451
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,720
you guys wanted us to create profiles we

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
created profiles they work did they work

453
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,120
as as the spec sheet said and the answer

454
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
is absolutely and then security people

455
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,720
come along and go seriously this is a

456
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
problem right because

457
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,959
it does create not even security at that

458
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
point now if you're talking next netflix

459
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,959
example but revenue people come along

460
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,440
but yes this creates an issue for us so

461
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
here we have two things that can be true

462
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
at the same time it can both be sunny

463
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
and raining at the same time you can

464
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
have a great feature that's also

465
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
hilariously exploitable and bad for the

466
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
company at the same time

467
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
um

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
uh yes that's uh that would be great uh

469
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,279
the world would be a better place if

470
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
those really cool ideas were at least

471
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
optional documented and always disabled

472
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,639
by default tyler good luck with life uh

473
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
if that is your philosophy um i would

474
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,399
love that too it's not the parallel

475
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
universe i live in but maybe it's at

476
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,920
some point

477
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,320
so let's think about uh how how we

478
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,560
address this what is the root cause

479
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,440
right how in the world did we get there

480
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,920
whose fault is it who do i blame where

481
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
do i go so all right there's a couple of

482
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
these uh the first one

483
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
is requirements in isolation and that

484
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
means that somebody

485
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
uh went through and took some

486
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,919
requirements

487
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,760
and didn't talk to anybody

488
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
earlier on in my in my career

489
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,280
i'm not going to tell you when but it

490
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,959
was a long time ago it was pre-2 000 i

491
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,199
i was perfectly aware of several of

492
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
these types of situations where

493
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,679
a bunch of project people got together

494
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,359
and said hey customer wants us to do

495
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,160
this

496
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
what do you guys think and yeah that

497
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,720
sounds like a great idea we should do it

498
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,480
this this this way add this feature move

499
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
along

500
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
nobody in security was ever invited to

501
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
those things

502
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
arguably in 2022 still aren't

503
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,280
but

504
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
it was the we'll do security on this

505
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
later right oh we'll have security give

506
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
this a look later well the problem with

507
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
that is is some things are fundamentally

508
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,919
broken and you can't security later then

509
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,880
so

510
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
you know something you get to this level

511
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
of catastrophic failure where you're

512
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
like look you put yourself into this

513
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,640
there's nothing i can do to get you out

514
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
uh i can just just watch the watch the

515
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
train wreck in slow motion uh

516
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
as this kid is uh the pain he's feeling

517
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,080
so think about flash uh if you guys

518
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
listen to the podcast way way back i had

519
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
brett arkan on the show golly it's been

520
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
a hot minute but

521
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
he talked about when his team took over

522
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
uh the uh

523
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,360
adobe at the time flash and swf player

524
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
was awesome

525
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
uh it you could do so many cool things

526
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,679
with it and and believe me people did i

527
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,520
did an entire talk on people doing

528
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
authentication uh within flash that was

529
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
fun

530
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
um

531
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
but he's like look the code had been

532
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
written the functions were in in the

533
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
plugin and they're like okay now you go

534
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,039
secure this he's like uh you're

535
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,440
accepting unvalidated input as part of

536
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
the app you're allowing this this and

537
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
this and this he goes

538
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
unless you change that i can't do

539
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
anything like no that's that's done

540
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
you just go some you know do the

541
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
security thing he's like all right so

542
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
what i had to do was either basically we

543
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
had to do a giant sandbox for this you

544
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,679
know hot mess of code

545
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
and and that's the situations y'all get

546
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
into and it is not fun so once the

547
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,039
requirement is built security can and

548
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,160
can be completely or at least nearly

549
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,120
unpossible or for those of you that

550
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,959
have know the reference inconceivable

551
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
so

552
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,600
it is

553
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
it is exciting that way

554
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,039
number two how does this happen well

555
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,480
development isolation so we've had

556
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,799
requirements in isolation

557
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
with nobody's input this is development

558
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,240
in isolation this is probably uh

559
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
a little further down the road at the

560
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
point where things still could be

561
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
salvaged but probably aren't

562
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
and so you know back in my uh back in my

563
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
vendor days when i worked for hp we we

564
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,280
had a fantastic unit that provided

565
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
customers with functional testing

566
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,960
software performance testing software

567
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
and we even bundled security testing

568
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
software well

569
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,799
we had so we challenge people to ask

570
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
does it function does it perform and is

571
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
it secure they got two out of three

572
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
right guess which one they didn't do

573
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
so the reality is

574
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,039
right development tends to get done

575
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,559
developers worry about function and

576
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,799
performance and uh it's really difficult

577
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,880
as an aside as a security professional

578
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
come in and say

579
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,799
we used to think about it this way well

580
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,919
what are all the things it's not

581
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,760
supposed to do

582
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
right uh if you remember the way appsec

583
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
used to work we'd get a scanner and we'd

584
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,080
say

585
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,720
okay i'm gonna scan it and it's gonna

586
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
anything that it kicks out is bad like

587
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
yeah but if we're right if a third party

588
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
is writing this tell me all right like

589
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,840
the the the developers and the project

590
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,039
managers are telling me all the things

591
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
that it should do here's the list

592
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
tell me all the things that you're at

593
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
the software is not supposed to do

594
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,520
you're like basically anything except

595
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
for these things in this list

596
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
and it turns out that's a hard thing

597
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
right so

598
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
these would become problems security

599
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,440
testing done later and much

600
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
much to my chagrin

601
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,880
you could still do security testing

602
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
later but not without the actual product

603
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,600
spec

604
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
not without what is it supposed to be

605
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,080
doing what are the actual requirements

606
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,799
uh does it does this app really require

607
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,600
me to upload arbitrarily any file or did

608
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
the customer say hey i want to upload

609
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
pictures

610
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,240
and could be could it be pictures of a

611
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,559
specific type jpeg

612
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,520
gif

613
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
and it could could it be pictures of a

614
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,400
specific size between two meg and 10 meg

615
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
like what's the use case for updating

616
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,000
four petabytes of of a gif file besides

617
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,159
hilarity right

618
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,799
so having specs when you're doing

619
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,280
security testing is super important if

620
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,440
you've got nothing else at that point

621
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
you should be able to do that so it

622
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
you're basically asking your security

623
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
team to you know go find all the things

624
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
that this thing's not supposed to do and

625
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
the answer is that's a pretty large

626
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,039
space of stuff

627
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
my favorite topic pattern-based security

628
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
testing i am i'm hoping that most of us

629
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
are through this uh dark forest and into

630
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,120
the light but if we're not

631
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,440
this is not uh this whole type of

632
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
vulnerability class right these these

633
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
abusive function this is not sql

634
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,280
injection and cross-site scripting where

635
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,120
you can develop patterns for it

636
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
write it into an app and say go

637
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,039
this requires

638
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,520
uh human creativity because scan tools

639
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
won't find it and this is where we get

640
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,360
that creative misuse again right we sit

641
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
in that uh we sit in that room and go

642
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,559
all right

643
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,320
i've run the scanner

644
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
uh it's kicked out some sql injections

645
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
some cross-site scripting easy to fix

646
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,159
we'll get the developers to do that now

647
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,520
what are all these things that what are

648
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
all the things that i could do with this

649
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
that i'm not supposed to do

650
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,720
and that is a really tough thing because

651
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,039
it's a lot of space and generally

652
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,720
speaking you're probably not allowed to

653
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,520
just go randomly beat up applications

654
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,000
and use cases

655
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,360
but we're agile that's great good luck

656
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,799
agile just means you can do it faster

657
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,400
but creative misuse is is both a

658
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
a good thing and a bad thing in this in

659
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
this discussion so

660
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
um

661
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,440
implementation ambiguity uh i i don't

662
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,559
like this

663
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
one number four here

664
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,200
but what it means to me is

665
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,440
i've asked for something ambiguous and

666
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,600
you've implemented something ambiguous

667
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
and the result is it does not really it

668
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,559
does either not enough or way too much

669
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,159
but at least it meets you know the base

670
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
of what i wanted so let me show you

671
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
hey anybody been on these calls well hey

672
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
uh the firewall's blocking this app okay

673
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
it's not working something's not working

674
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,360
it's got to be the firewall what's

675
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
always the firewall let me let me break

676
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,000
it to you

677
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
and somebody says well

678
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
okay fine how do i what do you need to

679
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,120
make this thing work what ports what

680
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,440
protocols what ip addresses what's the

681
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
application

682
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
and the person says i don't know just

683
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
enable any

684
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,200
and and yeah i mean and that's basically

685
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,880
what our reaction is

686
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,919
but

687
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,960
um

688
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
it's true um

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
what's really interesting is ambiguous

690
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
requirements uh tend to be people tend

691
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,880
to err on the side of overly uh overly

692
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,840
uh uh overly cautious uh they allow they

693
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,279
build in way more than they should

694
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,360
because you figure okay if somebody says

695
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
going back to that sweet tree swing if

696
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,360
somebody says i want a bridge uh

697
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,600
over this stream

698
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,240
uh you may think that it you know you

699
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
may want it to be

700
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,720
uh you know enclosed you may want it to

701
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,440
be

702
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,320
uh you know well leveled and what really

703
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,159
somebody's asking for is a two by four

704
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,880
so they can walk across it right

705
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,919
but if you over build odds are you can a

706
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,919
charge more b it looks really cool and

707
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,880
see

708
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
somewhere in that over build you've met

709
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,159
your customer requirement so

710
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,840
that's why it gets there

711
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,279
so do you guys remember this nightmare

712
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,159
right

713
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,480
when you know somebody you're on a call

714
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
or something and doing support and

715
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,600
somebody's well we just need to open all

716
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,120
the ports because it just has to work

717
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,480
we'll figure this out how to lock it

718
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
down later and the answer is no you

719
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
won't nobody ever does it's never going

720
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
to happen that way i'm sorry

721
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,159
number five is technical limitations and

722
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,000
uh some of these are real some of them

723
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,480
are uh contrived and by that i mean or

724
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
maybe even circumstantial

725
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,919
so we need to upload photos i you know

726
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,440
have been one of these conversations

727
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,360
where um

728
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,240
an app a project needed to upload photos

729
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,159
technical schematics whatever into an

730
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,279
application

731
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,799
and the developers were like yeah okay

732
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,799
i'll allow file uploads

733
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
and in reviewing of the spec

734
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,559
i thought to myself well

735
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
the customer request says

736
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,000
uh photo uploads

737
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
that it's app spec says file uploads

738
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
those are not the same

739
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,679
one encompasses the other

740
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,760
and you think okay what is it that i

741
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,919
could do if i could upload arbitrary

742
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,400
files to a web server

743
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,279
at any time

744
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,760
like holy crap right

745
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,200
hello malware

746
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
so

747
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,240
thinking about this the developer can't

748
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,159
potentially differentiate file types

749
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,000
okay so develop your developers either

750
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,039
not good

751
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,240
or the 18 year old or the 15 year old in

752
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
russia that you've hired isn't quite up

753
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
to the latest whatever on whatever

754
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,240
framework you're using and so rather

755
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
than photo uploads they do file uploads

756
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,919
they don't check sizes they don't even

757
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,360
check the header to make sure it

758
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,640
actually is a jpeg file if it's named

759
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,559
jpeg good enough for me

760
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,799
um

761
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,679
so

762
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,480
the reality is uh these can be technical

763
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
limitations so developers enables uh any

764
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
file upload and well you know you guys

765
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
know how that goes right

766
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,120
all right so hopefully uh

767
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,559
let me give you a second to kind of flip

768
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,678
through these comments uh

769
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
yes yes static code analysis helps in

770
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,799
some things but uh unfortunately

771
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,559
that doesn't unfortunately solve that

772
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,879
problem

773
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,559
so let's talk about how we can reduce

774
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,880
the and decrease the risks here because

775
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
the reality is it's not going to go away

776
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
uh blame does not fix this it doesn't

777
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
matter how many project managers you get

778
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,039
fired it doesn't matter how many

779
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,840
developers uh get tongue lashed and and

780
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,399
yelled at and reprimanded it doesn't

781
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,320
matter how many times you make the front

782
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,039
page of the new york times uh for being

783
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,080
uh you know

784
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,760
overly crazy um

785
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
it's going to happen again right so it

786
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,600
will guaranteed happen again somebody is

787
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
going to fall into one of those five

788
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,039
categories that i just went through on

789
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,000
the y

790
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
and we're going to uh we're going to get

791
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,120
to it's going to happen again

792
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
so you've got three possibilities okay

793
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,080
and

794
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,360
i i think the three possibilities um

795
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,679
i think they're very realistic

796
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,960
and i'm going to give them to you in

797
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,919
order

798
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,080
i think you should do them all

799
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,760
but if you can't

800
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,039
uh start start at least as far back into

801
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,039
the requirements phase as you possibly

802
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,600
can and if you can't then i'm i don't

803
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,919
know what to tell you so number one at

804
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
requirements time

805
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,000
critical requirements review all right

806
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
this doesn't require any particular

807
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,279
expertise in any you know particular

808
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,960
development language it doesn't even

809
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,679
require security people it just requires

810
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,000
somebody to do a critical review of the

811
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
requirements you're being asked to do

812
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,279
okay

813
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,000
uh the customer says upload i'll upload

814
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,840
all files can we restrict that somehow

815
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
like is that really necessary

816
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,799
uh am i do i really have to go you know

817
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,919
pull in arbitrary file types

818
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,159
ask these questions

819
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,159
ask lots of questions

820
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,440
and

821
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
you know i tell people uh act like a you

822
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,360
know sometimes in these things act like

823
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,720
a five-year-old does just keep saying

824
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,600
why

825
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,760
that needs to happen why because this

826
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
why because this why go do you know what

827
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,679
you're saying right now

828
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,760
and eventually you'll let people get to

829
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,279
the conclusion of

830
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
if if i continue down this requirement

831
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,960
path if i if i allow this to happen um

832
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,399
bad things are going to happen look guys

833
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,640
i know you want people to upload you

834
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,399
know arbitrary

835
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,760
files into this website that you're

836
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,200
creating because you want them to be

837
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,159
creative

838
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,760
but maybe stop to think that this could

839
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
create a wormable condition or your

840
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,279
application or our application could

841
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,200
become the source of a ransomware

842
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,720
outbreak and distribution method for

843
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,640
somebody else is that really something

844
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,039
you want can we do something

845
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,960
that could limit this right

846
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,600
ask do that what if analysis so what

847
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
happens if hey have you thought again

848
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,000
you guys thought about what if right and

849
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,399
and get into that into that mindset of

850
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,760
asking questions

851
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
because if you don't

852
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,279
i know who will

853
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,159
and they probably don't work for you

854
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
start thinking about misuse case this is

855
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,240
where the i guess the creativity of the

856
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,679
of this community really uh impresses me

857
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,919
because i think that we get

858
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
we are so creative by default sometimes

859
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,679
it's a little scary uh because i've seen

860
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,080
i've seen projects that

861
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
i would otherwise think are fairly well

862
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,520
locked down the requirements are pretty

863
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,679
good and somebody goes hey have you

864
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,960
thought about

865
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,679
whatever and my brain goes oh my god i

866
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,760
would have never thought that i can't

867
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
what kind of person would would do that

868
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,799
and you go wow that's terrible i need to

869
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
fix that so

870
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,039
uh it is it's interesting um

871
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,240
it's really interesting how some of the

872
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
misuse cases uh

873
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
apply and appear uh in in in in these

874
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,120
issues so down scope broad requirements

875
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
if something says i need all ports open

876
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,200
on on our firewall all ports open uh on

877
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,799
all these hosts

878
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
yeah no you don't like tell me what you

879
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
really want to do like the spice girl

880
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,960
song tell me what you want what you

881
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
really really want uh yeah i know it's a

882
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,919
job it's a drawback but uh

883
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,519
uh i think the

884
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
uh i think

885
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,039
trying to downscope what people want

886
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,240
because everybody's going to tell you

887
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
they want everything you go yeah but

888
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,679
that's not possible what's the what's

889
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,399
the least amount of fee function that

890
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,720
will accomplish the requirement

891
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
that i can secure

892
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,840
that i can think about securely

893
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,799
um

894
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,559
evil user stories i like that chris

895
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
that's a good idea

896
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,880
abuse cases evil user stories that's a

897
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,240
good idea

898
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,559
all right number two is development and

899
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,480
testing

900
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,399
i think that

901
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,240
if you're going to go have a little bit

902
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,279
of fun

903
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,360
have it during development and testing

904
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,120
phases

905
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,440
you're going to be able to

906
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,960
get a lot of really really interesting

907
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,640
results if you allow people to

908
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,440
um

909
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
really get involved in development

910
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,720
testing phases

911
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
but then again we've been saying that

912
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,120
for

913
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,519
literally decades now so test

914
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,399
requirements test the actual code itself

915
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,880
go in and look at

916
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,159
what it is

917
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,799
go look at all the things that you that

918
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,559
they think it does right so the way i

919
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,799
write that i do this mentally is i have

920
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,440
a white board and i i look at the

921
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,679
requirements like what is what what did

922
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,480
the

923
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,559
customer or the the person writing the

924
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,080
requirements

925
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,679
intend

926
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,399
and then i say what is the function and

927
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,760
i say then i have on the right side of

928
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,799
the board like what is all the things

929
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,559
that he could actually do that no this

930
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,720
side has never thought about

931
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
and that's a lot of fun

932
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,799
because what you oftentimes find is like

933
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,799
five requirements on this side and by

934
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,919
the time you get to the other side of

935
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,799
your board you're running out of space

936
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
because and then you get to have take

937
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,559
that take a picture of that send it to

938
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,640
the uh what i would do is i'd write the

939
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
good things in blue and the bad things

940
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,919
in red

941
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,760
and i would send it to the project

942
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,440
managers and i go all right

943
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,840
i did my analysis on your requirements

944
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,159
here's what i think and oftentimes they

945
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,080
would look at and go oh cool it can do

946
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,760
so many other why is all that red stuff

947
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,840
there right and and you go well what do

948
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,519
we do about that

949
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,760
and that sparks conversation so testing

950
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,000
code is a big big idea but testing it

951
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,840
before it becomes good but even when

952
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,679
you're looking at functions because

953
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,880
when you're like there's some of these

954
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
modules that get used they you know the

955
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
developer will use it for one function

956
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,760
within a module that has 40 other

957
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,120
functions in it

958
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,279
what are the other 40 do can we can we

959
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,120
add them can we have fun with them can

960
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,360
we do really really bad things with them

961
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
the answer is probably yes

962
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,919
testing downstream functions so okay

963
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,600
think about it this way

964
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
you are integrating multiple

965
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,760
applications and you you your app allows

966
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,480
uh file uploads um

967
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,880
they don't check for the header and so

968
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,559
even though it says photos only but it's

969
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,519
a you saw you create a dot j or dot jpeg

970
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,399
file with a bunch of css in it why not

971
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
because you can or whatever you want to

972
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
stuff inside there python whatever and

973
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
it goes downstream

974
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,399
and that downstream you know one

975
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,839
application passed to another pass to

976
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,040
another password and somewhere

977
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,199
downstream that app decides it's going

978
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,839
to process that file it looks at it and

979
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,399
says that's not a jpeg that's it that's

980
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,199
a

981
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,719
that's code i'm going to run that code

982
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,399
for you

983
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,239
it didn't affect you but it affected

984
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,000
something downstream so think about the

985
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,760
downstream functions

986
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,359
that happen

987
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,280
and that's a really impre impressive and

988
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,079
important uh way to look at it

989
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,399
because it forces you to look at the

990
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,440
entire ecosystem of what you're testing

991
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
and what you're developing rather than a

992
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,719
single function because just because

993
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,879
that single function can't be exploited

994
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,280
by the bad data you insert doesn't mean

995
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,119
the 17 other things that take advantage

996
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,560
of that data as a secondary uh consumer

997
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
of that data

998
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,480
that that bit that input doesn't mean

999
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
that they can't be badly uh influenced

1000
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,720
and broken so think about that one

1001
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,839
security test functionality

1002
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,720
so uh security test the functionality

1003
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
that's in these applications and what i

1004
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,760
mean by that is sure uh you know stuff

1005
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
uh sorry stuff uh a uh

1006
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,079
the wrong characters in there uh my uh

1007
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,280
my professor back in college uh when i

1008
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
when my first assignment in mips risk

1009
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,480
yes because this was a long time ago uh

1010
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
asked us to write a calculator in

1011
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,320
assembly and i was pretty impressed with

1012
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,040
myself i actually got it to run uh it

1013
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,359
was cool i could do five plus five ten

1014
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,480
plus ten

1015
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
twenty seven times you know

1016
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,000
eight and uh whatever it was and i i saw

1017
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
he asked for volunteers who got this

1018
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
code running and you know who's excited

1019
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
about it i'm so excited i i raise my

1020
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,640
hand

1021
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,960
he pops it up on the projector

1022
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,119
and uh he says all right

1023
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,359
it runs he goes uh now let's try some

1024
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,359
functions he did three plus three

1025
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,119
six like yes he does nine times you know

1026
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,079
seven

1027
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,200
yes

1028
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,880
a plus

1029
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,720
q i'm like wait why would you it core

1030
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,760
dump

1031
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,520
i was like wait why would you do that he

1032
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,800
goes why not

1033
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,880
because he didn't check your inputs

1034
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
and i said well okay

1035
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,040
but but it does all the things you told

1036
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,880
me to

1037
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,720
if you put in numbers it works but if

1038
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,240
you put don't put in numbers it doesn't

1039
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,200
work like why would anybody do that and

1040
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,119
that class more than anything got me

1041
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,200
thinking about this industry

1042
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,599
in the late 90s and middle late 90s

1043
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,200
because

1044
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,359
it got me thinking about all right but i

1045
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,599
did i filled the requirements

1046
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,760
but i didn't create limitations on those

1047
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,160
requirements and so people could stuff

1048
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,599
all kinds of things into my my

1049
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,040
calculator function

1050
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,440
and um

1051
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
yeah bad bad things happen

1052
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,400
and and uh and so

1053
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,520
that's a good area to think about

1054
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,400
really

1055
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,359
when you're talking about security

1056
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,280
testing functionality

1057
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,480
allow open-ended security testing so

1058
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,800
um yeah uh

1059
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,560
open-ended security testing is a lot of

1060
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,200
fun uh what i mean by that is don't

1061
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,119
don't put restrictions on your security

1062
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,599
testers uh when you're when you're

1063
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,400
testing a function an application a a

1064
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,040
kiosk whatever right whatever the thing

1065
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,000
is generally it's code of some kind

1066
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,680
but don't limit people

1067
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,240
uh allow them to get creative allow them

1068
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,079
to creatively misuse or be the evil user

1069
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,680
and then come out and have them come

1070
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
back to you with all the crazy things

1071
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,640
they could do

1072
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
that you would your your developers and

1073
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
your project management team and your

1074
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,320
customer would go

1075
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,880
why would anybody do that oh my gosh the

1076
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
outcome is not good

1077
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
right so

1078
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,359
you know if you can if you can deposit

1079
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
uh or if you can withdraw a negative

1080
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
number from your checking account

1081
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
um

1082
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,320
and it allows you to do that like this

1083
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
is an old trick way way way way back we

1084
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
used to play these uh uh when we you

1085
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,960
know we write we write code in school uh

1086
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,760
we'd write atm types of apps and uh if

1087
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
you could uh write one that would allow

1088
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,359
negative inputs to allow you to give

1089
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,280
yourself money

1090
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,960
why would anybody do that

1091
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
very simple okay i like money so

1092
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,200
open-ended security testing and allowing

1093
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
people to get creative is super

1094
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,720
important don't limit your testers which

1095
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
means this isn't going to be something

1096
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,599
that you know you can't give it to

1097
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,599
security on friday afternoon say hey

1098
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,000
it's going live on monday just go and

1099
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,839
give it a chance that's not how this

1100
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,440
works you have to be involved as much uh

1101
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,599
throughout the uh throughout the process

1102
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,359
yeah then i think record up all the

1103
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,160
things is a would be a good shirt uh or

1104
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
just one segment core delt i think that

1105
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,839
would just be you know that would just

1106
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,520
be a great shirt to have uh because

1107
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,280
people would look at you funny

1108
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,359
except for those that are old as us and

1109
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,440
then they'd laugh

1110
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,520
so you know let people get creative let

1111
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,839
people go blow things up and i'm sorry

1112
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,839
but sometimes it's going to require the

1113
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,200
system to go up in flames because

1114
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
it's better that you find that than

1115
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
somebody else

1116
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
don't artificially limit your security

1117
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,960
testing don't say you know you can only

1118
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,280
use these inputs don't do anything bad

1119
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,119
which is how we get to well i've already

1120
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,880
deployed this don't do anything bad that

1121
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
could harm the app and go ahead and

1122
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,000
securely test it that's nonsense that

1123
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
doesn't work

1124
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,880
all right so post deployment um

1125
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,760
there's things you can do for example um

1126
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
you know designing for failure uh you

1127
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,760
know this is this is something we

1128
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,960
started doing about 15 years ago

1129
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,480
not everybody's gotten that memo

1130
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,839
but i hear it's getting passed around

1131
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,680
quite a bit

1132
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
designing for failure is interesting

1133
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,880
because you say okay

1134
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,079
people are going to put all kinds of

1135
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,839
crazy things into this into this text

1136
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,359
field or try to upload all kinds of

1137
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,640
crazy files

1138
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,920
um

1139
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
what happens when when they get one past

1140
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
the development team

1141
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
what happens when they uh get one past

1142
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,560
us

1143
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,200
this is an opportunity for uh

1144
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,520
basically being able to log all the

1145
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,400
things

1146
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,160
or as many things as you as you can find

1147
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,280
necessary

1148
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,359
and then look at

1149
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,079
the

1150
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,160
uh look at the the things that you

1151
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,560
should be you should see and look at the

1152
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,960
things that are happening and say do

1153
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,720
these relatively close to match up and

1154
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,560
this is how you get behavioral profiling

1155
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,280
on applications on humans

1156
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,640
on anything

1157
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,000
because if we know what it's supposed to

1158
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,480
do and it's not doing that something

1159
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
could be very very wrong right like with

1160
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,359
that uh fish kissing picture earlier

1161
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,599
so designing for failures

1162
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,200
implementing compensating controls is

1163
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
also another thing right what you want

1164
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,520
to do is limit the impact of poor

1165
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,599
requirements

1166
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,720
as much as you can limit the impact of

1167
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,480
when something breaks

1168
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,800
you know this is why the concept of xero

1169
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,200
trust has gained so much traction and

1170
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,560
people have taken it so seriously

1171
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,760
because

1172
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,560
when when not if but when something

1173
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,319
catastrophically blows up in your

1174
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,000
environment how do you keep it from

1175
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,079
taking down the entire company right

1176
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,280
this is why cloud service providers um

1177
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,839
have uh have pushed this resiliency

1178
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,079
concept so if you know us east uh va uh

1179
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
one goes boom the whole world doesn't

1180
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,599
stop

1181
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,240
except that it sometimes does quite

1182
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,800
often in a big way but let's get past

1183
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,560
amazon um

1184
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,880
this stuff does happen right so how do

1185
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,839
you design for minimizing impact

1186
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,720
increasing resiliency and when bad

1187
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
things misuse happens what do you do

1188
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,880
about it that's an important question

1189
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,359
it's an important topic to discuss

1190
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,040
log and analyze is what i'm getting at

1191
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
right log

1192
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,880
application functions log

1193
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
the application when you're doing uh use

1194
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,200
case testing profile the application

1195
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
profile the thing how much cpu is it

1196
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,599
using how many queries does it do on

1197
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,160
average per uh how many times how many

1198
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,280
times

1199
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,599
does it query the database per user per

1200
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,839
minute how many rows on average does it

1201
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,960
return i we had a long time ago had a

1202
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,440
really cool case where

1203
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,000
an application got profiled using the

1204
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,720
performance management suite of tools so

1205
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,760
they knew the nominal cpu they knew peak

1206
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,119
times and low periods of the application

1207
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,920
they knew how many users it should have

1208
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
they knew how many how many queries uh

1209
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,160
how many connections each user opened

1210
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,640
how many queries they issued how many

1211
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,200
rows were on average returned

1212
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,560
and so

1213
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,760
when

1214
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,400
the security team saw a

1215
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,680
potential

1216
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,839
possible sql injection attack they

1217
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,680
looked back to the app team and the app

1218
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,079
team said well let's see

1219
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,920
one user has 25x the number of typical

1220
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,079
queries against the database it's

1221
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,599
returning 1000 x the row count

1222
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,400
and the cpu is 90 busier than it

1223
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,920
normally is yeah that's a problem

1224
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,200
probably right

1225
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,119
so being able to look at these things in

1226
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,960
multiple dimensions not in just our

1227
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,839
security dimension hugely important

1228
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,680
and it allows you to monitor for misuse

1229
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,520
guys this is really tough

1230
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,599
uh and and i'm not going to say there's

1231
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,520
a magic unicorn out there that's going

1232
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,200
to do it there's been apps out there

1233
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
that have said you know we profile do

1234
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,119
behavioral profiling and understand how

1235
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,160
things go

1236
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,400
the reality is apps are complex

1237
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,000
environments are complex and sometimes

1238
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,079
sometimes thing your applications will

1239
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,960
do completely bonkers things uh

1240
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
just because that's the way they were

1241
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,680
designed and they were gonna do

1242
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,480
completely bonkers things um but try

1243
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,720
your best to monitor for misuse all

1244
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,839
right and i'll give you guys some of my

1245
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,599
parting thoughts here this is a common

1246
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,880
issue

1247
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,720
this is not something that you're just

1248
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,480
facing i'm just facing it's happening

1249
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,640
everywhere all the time it happens to

1250
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,160
major companies

1251
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,000
really good companies like netflix and

1252
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,560
amazon it happens to tiny companies it

1253
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
happens in just about everybody

1254
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,839
bad features are everywhere and there is

1255
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,079
absolutely no magic fix okay that's the

1256
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,000
sad part there's not a magic fix but you

1257
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,680
can have fun trying

1258
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,200
um you're gonna need some sort of

1259
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,680
strategy uh and that that's a good thing

1260
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,520
right review your requirements with your

1261
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,319
teams get involved in the design as much

1262
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,359
as possible and employ that creativity

1263
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,079
that we're also so always excited about

1264
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,359
in testing ask lots of questions it's

1265
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,960
their human nature

1266
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,560
and every once in a while add three plus

1267
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,240
q and see what happens if you get the

1268
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
result i got which was a psycball core

1269
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,880
dump

1270
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,119
and then find less terrible alternatives

1271
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,720
look if if you know you're um

1272
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,359
i i've got a request this is not a joke

1273
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,119
i have a requirement right now from a

1274
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,200
customer that i'm working with

1275
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,599
where they have an application

1276
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,200
that has i'm not kidding ftp open to the

1277
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,240
internet because some of their

1278
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,040
devices let's say have to upload data

1279
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,640
and they're very old and this is the

1280
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,480
only way they do it they're like well we

1281
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,720
have to allow ftp

1282
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,119
and i i about fell out of my chair when

1283
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,640
i when i said that when they said that

1284
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,640
because i was like am i still in 2022

1285
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,480
like what day is it what year is it what

1286
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,440
planet am i on that ftp is still a thing

1287
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,079
it is i promise it still happens um and

1288
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,319
so we had to come up with compensating

1289
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,160
controls less terrible alternatives all

1290
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,960
right

1291
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,160
if that's if that's got to happen

1292
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,040
cool

1293
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,440
uh can we limit where it comes from can

1294
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,599
we limit how big the files are can we

1295
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,480
limit

1296
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
get uh put only not get like what can we

1297
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,560
do here

1298
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,280
and so find less terrible alternatives

1299
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,880
that all of them might be terrible some

1300
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,400
of them have to be less terrible than

1301
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,200
others uh and that's it for me uh i will

1302
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,560
happy to i've been kind of trying to

1303
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,800
read as i as i went along

1304
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,839
um

1305
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,599
fuzz or fault inject all the things yes

1306
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,960

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,040
chance you got them here

1330
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,720
anyone out there that wants to put it in

1331
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,520
the q a panel and uh we'll make sure

1332
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,680
that uh he answers it for you if you can

1333
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,680
great talk though yeah i love you about

1334
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,240
inflammatory management and looking for

1335
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,599
um

1336
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,920
looking for anomalies becomes easier if

1337
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,000
you understand what the app's telemetry

1338
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
is supposed to be like right makes the

1339
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,880
security job much easier too

1340
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,319
well but that's and that's the thing is

1341
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,280
that um

1342
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,800
oftentimes

1343
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,400
and this is this is kind of the change

1344
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,920
that's happening in the industry i think

1345
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,160
you know devops by the way devsecops not

1346
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,040
a thing uh that devops has when security

1347
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,520
gets involved has helped us with is

1348
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,359
we get a peek at the application

1349
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,720
telemetry

1350
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,119
not just a security telemetry

1351
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,599
because sql injection or application

1352
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,760
attacks don't always present themselves

1353
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,400
as really nice rules for snort or

1354
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,280
whatever thing you're using to identify

1355
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,359
sometimes they they get to the point

1356
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,520
where one of the developers goes well

1357
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,359
that's weird that's not supposed to

1358
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,559
happen

1359
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,559
and whereas they would do that you'd go

1360
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,280
oh god i know what that is right but

1361
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,680
these are two silos of data two silos of

1362
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,160
alerts uh that you're nev that very

1363
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,319
rarely cross paths

1364
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,359
and it's it's a challenge for us uh and

1365
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,359
that's where you know badness hides

1366
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,720
right is where it is in that

1367
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,240
intersection where

1368
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,319
uh in in the gray space we don't have

1369
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,800
access to

1370
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,240
i think i think it's interesting too

1371
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,200
that

1372
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,000
when security and and the app teams get

1373
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,440
together and they start understanding

1374
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,800
how the applications are supposed to

1375
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,640
function they can look for anomalies a

1376
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
little better that way but the flip side

1377
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,720
is it has security and and the app team

1378
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,960
can get together to start providing

1379
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,520
mechanisms for understanding misuse and

1380
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,000
looking for it so an example is you know

1381
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,400
you can do a lot with deception and

1382
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,359
detecting for things like having

1383
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,680
you know urls in a robots.txt that you

1384
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,440
know are not valid that are easy to

1385
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,440
monitor to understand

1386
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,240
and get uh early warning of what

1387
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,559
potentially could be going wrong right

1388
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,319
it's hard for developers to think like

1389
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,000
attackers though but when they start

1390
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,839
understanding what those methodologies

1391
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,559
are

1392
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,240
they can start plumbing in things like

1393
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,000
when you're talking about you know sql

1394
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,520
injection and all that hey a good

1395
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,359
person's not going to be firing sql map

1396
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,800
at the system they're actually going to

1397
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,880
delay that and slow it down you're not

1398
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
going to catch it through your normal

1399
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,240
query patterns now i'm not saying it

1400
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,440
won't happen because there's always some

1401
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,559
idiot that thinks that they're the

1402
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,720
hacker wanting to use sql map but but in

1403
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,559
the end the point of being able to

1404
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,440
understand but is it makes sense for

1405
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,920
them to be accessing those views or that

1406
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,520
this is where the app team has to be

1407
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,200
able to get with the with the security

1408
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,319
team to be able to tell them this is how

1409
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,240
our apps are supposed to function here's

1410
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,920
what we're supposed to be doing and if

1411
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,680
if the security team can help educate

1412
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,720
them on

1413
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,480
well here's what

1414
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,480
malfeasance might look like they can

1415
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,079
start plumbing that in to being able to

1416
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,640
understand and communicate what logs are

1417
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,720
important what telemetry is important

1418
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,200
what information yeah watch for right

1419
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,119
yeah and and look i i know it's gonna

1420
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,880
give you guys some some of you guys ptsd

1421
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
but let me just bring a blog for jay for

1422
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,520
a second

1423
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,480
that is that is functionality

1424
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,119
legitimately somebody looked at and said

1425
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,520
this is we want this a group of people

1426
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,160
said yes let's add this into the code

1427
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,319
and they did they tested it to make sure

1428
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,680
that it worked

1429
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,720
and somehow we didn't realize holy crap

1430
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,240
look what you can do with this until

1431
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,839
like what it was in a year or a couple

1432
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,839
years later i've lost track of this now

1433
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:08,559
but

1434
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,920
um

1435
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,880
it's like

1436
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,079
like this was it was a great idea

1437
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,119
in the use case it was also a great idea

1438
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,359
in the misuse case but just nobody

1439
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,079
looked at like hey what happens if you

1440
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,240
ha

1441
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,440
you can always argue for things like why

1442
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,280
don't we have egress filters on those

1443
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,440
servers as well like why should there be

1444
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,800
a jndi even a thing going outbound or

1445
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,480
inbound on a web server that's not

1446
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,920
needing it if it's something that's a

1447
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,440
requirement it should be part of an

1448
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,800
engineering change order part of the

1449
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
change management that you're opening

1450
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,000
important here is why and here's why

1451
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,319
this is described as an important

1452
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,920
behavioral change to how this app's

1453
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,480
going to work but very few people set up

1454
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,319
their servers to actually support eagers

1455
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,839
filtering the right way to block because

1456
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,200
they're just trying to make it work

1457
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,800
right and that becomes part of the

1458
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,520
problem well and i yeah i mean look i i

1459
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,319
think

1460
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,119
this is this is

1461
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,839
this is just what happens when

1462
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,520
um we look at um

1463
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,079
we look at functionality we want to add

1464
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,800
and look this is the uh

1465
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,400
uh spectre uh

1466
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,839
the processor bug

1467
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:18,640
uh

1468
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,720
it was another perfect example of this

1469
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,200
where somebody a bunch of engineers sat

1470
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,119
around and said holy crap we can achieve

1471
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,440
an extra 20 25 performance improvement

1472
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,800
if we do this

1473
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,079
i guarantee you somebody said yeah but

1474
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,760
you know what somebody could figure this

1475
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,640
out and do x and they went yeah but what

1476
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,880
are the odds they were right arguably

1477
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,960
really low

1478
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,640
and then the what if statement came like

1479
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,240
you know what i bet we can get a lot of

1480
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,480
we can get ahead of our competitor if we

1481
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,760
do this

1482
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,319
the risk is small let's go do it and

1483
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,240
then like 20 years later somebody went

1484
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,920
oh my gosh i can find a way to exploit

1485
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,240
this under these 17 correct conditions

1486
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,400
with my hand on the keyboard my gun to

1487
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,440
the admins head it's like okay great

1488
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,200
meanwhile intel's like well we got 20

1489
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,200
years of market share out of this sweet

1490
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,640
is that a vulnerability was that the

1491
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,119
most brilliant like risk uh calculation

1492
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,200
ever i don't know uh i'm gonna i

1493
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,480
wouldn't bet with the intel folks

1494
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,960
frankly

1495
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,599
but it was a vulnerability yeah yeah it

1496
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,119
was these are these yeah chris you're

1497
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,800
right these trade-offs

1498
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
are these these are trade-offs people

1499
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,559
make but sometimes

1500
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,240
but there's there's a difference between

1501
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,640
that kind of calculated trade-off

1502
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,359
and the yeah sure let's just allow

1503
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,760
people you know i've seen developers do

1504
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,240
this over and over and over again where

1505
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,720
the requirement is upload photo into

1506
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
your profile

1507
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,040
by the time it makes into the tech spec

1508
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,359
it says upload files into the

1509
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,720
application you're like those are not

1510
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,800
the same what happened between here and

1511
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,000
here

1512
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,920
right and it's because somebody that the

1513
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,720
person that gave the customer a request

1514
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,960
and the technical person did not see eye

1515
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,480
to eye they did not speak the same

1516
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,880
language it was a close enough good

1517
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,559
enough no it wasn't no no it wasn't

1518
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,319
somebody has to review that and go yeah

1519
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,319
these two things not the same well

1520
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,520
that's the benefit of things like threat

1521
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,720
modeling because it gives you the

1522
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,960
ability to start put creating that

1523
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,119
security debt in the backlog so it's

1524
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,800
understood these are the things that

1525
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,119
we're exposing ourselves to and again it

1526
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,880
gets that alignment because you know

1527
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,839
most pms are being uh remunerated on

1528
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,440
expansion and growth and so at the end

1529
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,720
of the day they're not thinking about

1530
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,480
the ass they want usability over

1531
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,319
security at any day not that they're

1532
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,760
trying to be malfeasant they just don't

1533
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,000
know any better and so they'll spec it

1534
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,920
out as being i want to upload a profile

1535
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,160
picture but by time that's turned into

1536
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,520
something the developer understands

1537
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,960
who's not thinking about security and

1538
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,800
that right um it's not that they're

1539
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,079
trying to be lazy or that they're just

1540
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,520
trying to put it into a user story that

1541
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,280
makes sense but the threat model should

1542
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,640
catch that because someone should be

1543
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,079
questioning that and saying hey wait a

1544
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,839
minute if we're uploading a file could

1545
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,520
they just not upload a web shell like

1546
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,599
hey what about that right like simple

1547
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,599
examples but you get the point yeah that

1548
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,760
would that web show example and i i

1549
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,160
that's that's a brilliant one because

1550
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,280
it

1551
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,480
something that should have never

1552
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,800
happened no and yet it's a brilliant

1553
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,200
example of functionality gone horribly

1554
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,160
wrong

1555
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,680
like somewhere there was a recommend

1556
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,280
there was a requirement to upload

1557
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,720
something and then suddenly we're like

1558
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
yeah sure why not code no problem why

1559
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,599
not you're like uh wait what

1560
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,520
yeah there's there's so many examples of

1561
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,520
admin functionality

1562
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,040
um

1563
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,119
and covert exposes to a bunch of this

1564
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,760
where we didn't have the right controls

1565
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,000
and so suddenly employees need to work

1566
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,200
from home meant put a bunch of rdp's uh

1567
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,520
rdp open out to the world with nothing

1568
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,119
front-ending it and allow it from

1569
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,200
anywhere with no authentication uh

1570
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,760
before you hit rdp and you're like what

1571
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,599
the hell happened there

1572
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,880
yeah and those machines that are that

1573
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,400
we're using at home that typically

1574
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,319
aren't corporate managed which you know

1575
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,480
your sons

1576
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,599
you know they're playing games and the

1577
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,000
next thing you know it becomes the pivot

1578
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,480
point into the organization right listen

1579
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,000
the ceo uh takes the laptop home uh

1580
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,240
because his kid has to go to school on

1581
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,319
that same laptop maybe not the ceo maybe

1582
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,640
the admin maybe the engineer maybe the

1583
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,720
who knows with the jetted or whatever

1584
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,880
but that lab that corporate laptop maybe

1585
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,319
it is a corporate laptop that went home

1586
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,000
but suddenly now their kid has to go to

1587
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,680
school from home and they don't have

1588
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,599
another device and suddenly they're

1589
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,359
using that device to browse facebook

1590
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,079
play games and go to school and that

1591
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,079
device has then got corporate secrets on

1592
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,520
it good luck protecting that i don't

1593
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,160
care who you are yeah uh you're going to

1594
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,520
you're going to lose that battle every

1595
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,880
time if you don't compensating controls

1596
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,000
logging

1597
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,280
and misuse

1598
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,000
identification and i mean that's it

1599
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,839
that's

1600
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,559
it

1601
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,359
