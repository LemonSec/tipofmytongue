graduated from sfu last year um during

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,400
the heat wave actually i had my on

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
online convocation

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
and i majored in computing science

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
and i also hold a security plus

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
certification from comptia

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
and

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
before being an analyst i just played a

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
bunch of uh capture the flags attended

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119
workshops and conferences like this one

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,240
um

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
and outside cyber security i love

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,399
outdoors um

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,439
explore bc and i play a bunch of musical

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,919
instruments

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,640
so

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
as part of our appsec team we do

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
different kinds of security assessments

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
for our clients

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
we do a lot of

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,280
of

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,399
application

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,640
penetration testing engagements um

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,319
especially web application security

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,760
testing

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
um we're also like a multi-talented team

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
so we also do a vulnerability assessment

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
for our clients rt infrastructure

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,879
and part of our engagements um aside

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
from testing is we do a lot of client

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
communications so meetings calls and

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
emails

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
and reports we

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
write a lot of reports

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
i once wrote a 100 page report for one

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
of our vulnerability assessment

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
engagements

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
and yeah client presentation as well

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
and other things that i've been

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
personally involved um are things like

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
leading a vulnerability management

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,800
program for one of our clients so

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
like managing assets for our clients and

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
making sure that the high severity

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,159
vulnerabilities on the systems or patch

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
i have also been involved in an early

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
security investigation for one of our

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,599
clients

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
so like during one of the assessments

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,800
that we had we found

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
strong evidence that there is a malware

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
implant on some of the machines

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
so yeah i was i was part of that early

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,799
investigation of that incident

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
and that was on a link on a long weekend

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,400
too so that was interesting

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
i've also hosted an information session

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
for one of our clients so i had to talk

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,519
about

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,159
what happens after a corporate-owned

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
laptop that is connected to their it

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,280
network

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
gets compromised by threat actor

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,720
so

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
how the attacker can do maximum damage

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
after that initial access

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
and the business impact and implication

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,560
of that to the whole organization

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,599
and as well as helping

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
build internal tools for our team to

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,640
help us assessments

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
and yeah so

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,879
why did i want to do this talk

109
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
because i've been there

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
i've experienced the same struggles of

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
being into the field or just you know

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
breaking into our industry

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,918
so

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
yeah i know what it's like

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
and you know i've seen and learned a lot

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,479
of valuable things from my time as a

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,680
security analyst and so i just thought

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
of sharing some of these with you to

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
help you guys have a more smooth sailing

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,080
um in your early cyber career

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
and with that

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
let's get right into it

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,720
so for my first tip actually a pre-tip

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,759
um

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,440
it's about taking notes

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
and yeah it's a simple one um sounds

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
obvious to you

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,120
but it is important and a lot of juniors

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
or a lot of people who are in the early

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
of their cyber security career

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
they usually don't get into this habit

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
of taking notes

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
and

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
i'm guilty of this as well

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
and yeah um the problem is um you will

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
forget a lot of things you know it'll

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
happen

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
because there's just too many things to

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,199
remember too many information to process

140
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,680
um but if you keep asking your teammates

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,919
your team is or whoever um thinks like

142
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,880
oh hey sorry um i forgot to do this uh

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
can you explain to me can you explain

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,240
this to me again

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
oh hey um what did the client say again

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
i'm sorry i forgot

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
um if you keep doing that it'll just

148
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,600
it'll just cause unnecessary friction

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
time will just not be well spent for you

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
um and the other person

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,639
yeah by taking notes you can just you

152
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,080
can save a lot of time and effort for

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
you and the other person and because you

154
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
just have you have something to refer

155
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
back to

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
so that's easy enough

157
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
now for my first actual tip

158
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
take advantage of free resources

159
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
um you might find that

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
a lot of times you need to fill in the

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
gaps of your hacking slash penetration

162
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,120
testing skills

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,639
as i did as well

164
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,440
and the good news is there's tons of

165
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,160
free resources out there

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
and i use these a lot

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
still

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
just quickly going over this table and

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,479
feel free to take a screenshot

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
and by the way uh

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,639
this this table is not an exhaustive

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
list so

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
yeah from ctf so

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
actually capture the flags for for those

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
of you who are not familiar with uh what

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,319
ctf is

177
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
they're essentially like um events where

178
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560
you can solve different cyber security

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
challenges

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
and yeah there are tons of ctfs

181
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
happening each week you can check that

182
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,919
out on this website ctf.org

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,720
this ctf called picocdf i really like

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
this one because it's focused for

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
beginners

186
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,960
they have advanced challenges as well

187
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,840
but

188
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,639
um

189
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,120
i've used this a lot in the past and

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,440
they leave their challenges on the page

191
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
even after the event so people can

192
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
practice

193
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,080
so yeah check that out as well

194
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
labs and training grounds so hack the

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
box is really a good one um they have

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
challenges from beginner to advanced uh

197
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
skill level

198
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,680
over the wire um it's a really good

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,199
resources they cover a lot of basic

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
stuff

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,960
um learning materials there there's a

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
bunch out there um from try hack me and

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039

204
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,280
um this one i really like um the one

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
from ports figure it's called web

206
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
security academy

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,199
it is focused obviously on web

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,960
application security

209
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
but yeah they have tons of labs and tons

210
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,840
of learning materials um

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,039
and yeah i still use this a lot even now

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,479
and it's free

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,160

different

218
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,160
security certifications um for different

219
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
cybersecurity domains

220
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
and their difficulty the difficulty of

221
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
the certification so check this page out

blog posts and youtube pages so there's

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
tons out there from various researchers

225
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,479
github is a really good resource they

226
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,279
have a lot of tutorials guidelines tools

227

you name it

228
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,279
reddit is a good good resource as well

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,039
it can be subjective but

230
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,120
still great resources they have a lot of

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
subreddits about cyber security

232
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
and yeah like youtube pages from null

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
buys and live overflow

234
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,600
um

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
clubs in small organizations a lot of a

236
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
lot of university around the world they

237
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
have security clubs that you can join

238
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
even if even if you don't go to that

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
university

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,560
um

241
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
yeah a lot of them have discord service

242

that you can join so check them out as

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440

um

245
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
local groups um here in vancouver such

246
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
as defcon 604 and the os vancouver

247
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,440
chapter

248
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
um i believe they hold monthly meetings

249
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
monthly sessions

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
and yeah they've been really helpful

251
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
i've been attending a lot of them and

252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
yeah go check them out

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
and

254
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
things like news and podcasts um

255
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,399
the one that i really like is the one

256
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
from darknet diaries they're really good

257
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
and um they're really compelling in

258
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
their storytelling

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,839
so yeah i've i've learned a lot from

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
these resources myself and they've

261
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
helped me improving my security cyber

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
security knowledge and skills so

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,839
go check them out

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
all right moving on

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,560
so for my second tip it's about not

266
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
solely focusing on your hacker tools uh

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
slash pen test tools

268
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
you know uh your toolkit is still

269
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
definitely important but

270
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,000
it's it's not tools are not it's not the

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
part tools um it's not the whole story

272
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,600
you know of hacking slash band testing

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,480
best

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
fan testing

275
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
and the problem is you know even if you

276
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
have all the state of the art pentest

277
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
tools out there

278
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
you can still have an incomplete

279
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
assessment

280
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,440
or

281
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,279
miss important vulnerabilities if you're

282
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,360
not looking at the right places

283
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
or just approaching it the wrong way

284
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
you should focus on more important

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
things such as how you think like being

286
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
creative thinking outside the box

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
observing patterns looking at the bigger

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,120
picture things like that

289
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,839
um things like developing a solid

290
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,440
testing approach or solid testing

291
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,959
methodology

292
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,920
you know like doing a proper recon first

293
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,640
so

294
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
um recon is short for reconnaissance so

295
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,440
that's

296
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
um when you gather as much information

297
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
as you can about your targets

298
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,399
um so doing that first before being

299
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,480
before jumping into your testing right

300
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
away

301
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,800
and things like thinking about the root

302
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
of the problem or root of the

303
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,839
vulnerabilities

304
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,800
or the security issues that you find

305
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
sometimes two different issues arise

306
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
because of the same underlying issue or

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
underlying problem

308
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
and i've struggled with this a lot as

309
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
well i realized my camera

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
my camera just turned off um

311
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,680
but yeah i've struggled with this a lot

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,839
especially when i just started in cyber

313
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
security industry

314
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,040
but

315
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
shifting away from this tools focus

316
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
mindset

317
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
has really helped me a lot in our future

318
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
engagements

319
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
became more efficient and i found more

320
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,079
vulnerabilities

321
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
that i wouldn't have found with this

322
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,639
you know tools focused mindset

323
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,279
there we go hopefully my camera is back

324
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,560
and yeah

325
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,079
as one example

326
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
in one of our web application security

327
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
testing engagement

328
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,519
i was able to find a hidden flaw in the

329
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,880
application

330
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,839
and

331
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
doing extra maneuvering steps ultimately

332
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
led me to

333
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,560
things like privilege escalation issues

334
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
where i could do admin functionalities

335
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
even if i

336
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,920
didn't have an admin admin rights

337
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,040
and things like accessing sensitive data

338
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,279
of other users such as

339
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,240
full name um home address

340
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,680
email

341
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
social insurance numbers or sins

342
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
things like bank information employment

343
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
information all those juicy stuff

344
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,240
and

345
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,680
yeah i would have missed those security

346
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
issues if i still had that tools focus

347
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
mindset

348
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,959
that was a fun engagement actually

349
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
but yeah um

350
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
long story short focus on this

351
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,320
quote-unquote

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
hacker mentality and

353
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
yeah um more than just

354
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,279
knowing x amount of tools out there

355
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
having this mentality

356
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
will help you more

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,440
in the long run

358
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,560
all right

359
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,279
so

360
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
for my third tip

361
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
it's about relating the technical parts

362
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
technical parts of cyber security to the

363
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
business side of things

364
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,519
and this is really important in our

365
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,959
industry

366
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,279
one of the most important things that

367
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,120
you know you need to understand in in

368
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
the infosec industry

369
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
is the business impact of cyber security

370
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
so when clients and organizations when

371
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
they bring you on board as a security

372
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
expert

373
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,040
it's to help the business stay secure or

374
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,959
be more secure

375
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
um if you don't understand the business

376
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
side of things or the deeper essence of

377
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
cyber security

378
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,279
or

379
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,639
you know if you can't relate the

380
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,199
technical issues that you find um to the

381
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
business of your clients or your own

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,839
organization if you're part of their

383
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,480
security team

384
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
you won't be able to

385
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
do a true and complete security

386
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
assessment you know

387
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
your assessment will just be less

388
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,720
valuable to the business of your clients

389
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
and what's more is that

390
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
most of the time

391
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,760
you'll find that you'll have to speak to

392
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,839
people like executives

393
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,000
owners and directors about cyber

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,519
security

395
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,800
and yeah they are non-technical folks

396
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
so if you go all out technical to them

397
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
give just dump them all the technical

398
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
details

399
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
they'll just fly over their heads

400
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
or just they just won't care about those

401
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,760
technical details

402
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,880
so

403
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
you also have to have a common language

404
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
with those non non-technical folks

405
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,040
and

406
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
speak cyber security in business terms

407
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,399
in order to work in concert with them

408
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
excuse me

409
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
and yeah i'm guilty of this as well i

410
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
struggled with this

411
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
especially when i just got into the

412
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
industry i was only focused on the

413
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,360
technical stuff

414
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
but after focusing on this business

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,639
impact mindset i noticed that

416
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,120
i was able to provide more value to our

417
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
clients

418
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,800
so like clients were able to understand

419
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,199
better the importance of the security

420
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
findings that we delivered to them

421
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,560
which often resulted in the remediation

422
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,079
actions

423
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,399
being taken or being put on top of their

424
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,120
priority list

425
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,639
i also noticed that i was able to

426
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
provide better business recommendations

427
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,920
um in general um

428
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
so in our assessments

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
not only we provide the security issues

430
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
that we find

431
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
we also provide business recommendations

432
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,759
to

433
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
better guide them in the right direction

434
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,000
and increasing their security maturity

435
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,639
of their organization

436
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,720
and because i understand the business

437
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,040
side of things better

438
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
i'm able to provide a more valuable

439
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,360
business recommendation and help them

440
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
make informed decisions or better

441
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
informed decisions

442
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,920
so

443
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
yeah once you have this business impact

444
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,079
mindset you know

445
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
ingrained in your mind

446
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
you'll find that you'll be able to do

447
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,959
the same

448
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,199
and provide more value to your clients

449
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,399
or your own organization

450
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
so keep this in mind keep this in the

451
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
back of your mind every time

452
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,199
whenever you see a vulnerability

453
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,839
ask yourself how does this impact or how

454
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
does this affect

455
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
the business of my clients or my own

456
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
organization

457
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
all right

458
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,359
for my fourth tip

459
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,599
it's about the

460
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
importance of soft skills

461
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,319
they do matter a lot

462
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,480
and we often forget to work on them you

463
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,199
know

464
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,799
and only focus on our technical skills

465
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,559
guilty as well here

466
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,000
i've had my early struggles because

467
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,679
certain areas of my soft skills were

468
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,799
lacking

469
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
and it did slow down some of our

470
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,399
engagements that i had early on

471
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
and yeah soft skills are often

472
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
overlooked

473
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
but

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
they're still very important in our

475
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,760
industry

476
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
as a matter of fact

477
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
as you can see here

478
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,799
according to an annual global survey

479
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,360
done by asaka in q4 of last year of 2021

480
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
one of the things that the survey

481
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
covered was about

482
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
the top

483
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
top skill gap in our in today's cyber

484
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
security professionals

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,520
and what came out on top

486
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,679
soft skills

487
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,480
and um by the way this the survey was

488
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
sent to cyber security professionals and

489
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,799
managers around the world

490
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,640
and yeah 54 of them have answered soft

491
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,760
skills

492
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,679
as the biggest skill gap in our industry

493
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
i was surprised by this actually um but

494
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
it kind of made sense like like i said

495
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
um

496
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,679
we focus so much on our technical skills

497
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,360
that you know we set aside our soft

498
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,760
skills

499
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
so yeah you should work and focus on

500
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
your soft skills as well so

501
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
things like your communication skills um

502
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
how you communicate with your clients

503
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,679
and with your team

504
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
whether that's written or verbal or an

505
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
in-person setting or remote setting

506
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
you know even if you're

507
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
technically bright if you can't

508
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
communicate your knowledge properly

509
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,200
that's no good

510
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,440
on things like your writing skills so

511
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
reports and documentations you will

512
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
write a lot of reports as a security

513
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
analyst

514
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
and they are very important part of any

515
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,600
security assessment

516
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
and things like presentation skills or

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
speaking or speaking skills

518
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
when you're doing client presentations

519
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,360
or hosting workshops or information

520
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
sessions

521
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
if you notice

522
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,480
some present presentation screw-ups from

523
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,039
from my talk or from other speakers

524
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
learn from my mistakes and do the

525
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,170
opposite

526
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,400
[Music]

527
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
and things like your teamwork skills um

528
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
or your interpersonal skills you know

529
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
like i said um like working with your

530
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
clients or your team i'm getting along

531
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,000
with people

532
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,559
um if you're a douchebag nobody's gonna

533
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
want to work with you right

534
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,919
and things like time management skills

535
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,799
so how you prioritize your tasks like

536
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
respecting other people's time

537
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
and things like your organizational

538
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,918
skills

539
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,200
um

540
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
focusing in your soft skills

541
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
will do you wonders for your

542
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,200
cybersecurity career

543
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
at least for me i've noticed how much i

544
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
became a more well-rounded security

545
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
analyst after focusing in this area

546
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,799
so like

547
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,039
report writing doesn't take as long as

548
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,400
before anymore

549
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
i don't struggle as much anymore

550
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,679
presentation my presentation and

551
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
speaking skills i get my points across

552
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
across clients better

553
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,520
and my ideas across my teammates better

554
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,720
client presentations have become

555
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
smoother

556
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,400
than when i started

557
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
and

558
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
i'm even able to speak in a conference

559
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,879
like this one which is awesome

560
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
so yeah

561
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
the importance of soft skills you know

562
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
might be obvious but it's still easily

563
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
forgotten

564
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
in fact so much forgotten

565
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
that it's still considered one of the

566
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
top skill gaps in our industry

567
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,280
so

568
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,960
yeah you should focus on improve your

569
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,600
soft skills uh now or

570
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
sooner

571
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,520
rather than later

572
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
and lastly um

573
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,840
you're compassion

574
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,919
probably like compassion

575
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,039
what the hell is that gonna do with

576
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
cyber security

577
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
but i mean by i mean by this is being

578
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
compassionate to other people um to your

579
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,919
co-juniors or to other people who are

580
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,600
just learning

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,840
other people who are just trying to get

582
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,320
into the cyber security industry

583
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
and obviously to your superiors

584
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
but

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
and also most importantly

586
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
to yourself

587
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
i struggled with this as well where and

588
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,159
still do sometimes um where i am being

589
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,400
too hard on myself um for making you

590
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,799
know silly mistakes small mistakes

591
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,200
and for not knowing things

592
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
but you know um

593
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
tell yourself that it's okay to make

594
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,159
mistakes

595
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,960
it's okay to not know things and yeah

596
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
it's okay to admit that you don't know

597
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
things

598
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
nobody's perfect

599
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
you should have this slogan on a t-shirt

600
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
or something that says paul but he's

601
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,280
nervous

602
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
yeah um

603
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
don't be too hard on yourself

604
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
you know everybody starts somewhere so

605
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,640
it's okay if you don't know certain

606
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
things yet

607
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,000
what's more important is taking the

608
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,360
steps to improving them

609
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,159
and

610
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,240
yeah have confidence and believe in

611
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
yourself you know

612
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
you'll find that you can do so much more

613
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
when you stop doubting yourself or

614
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,440
doubt yourself less

615
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,520
things might not be a smooth sailing all

616
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
the time but

617
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
don't be discouraged

618
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
um just think that you know don't think

619
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
that you failed yet just think that

620
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400

627
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
security

629
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,640
that is all the tips that i have for you

630
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,679
today

631
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,799
i hope

632
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,799
these have been insightful for you guys

633
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,480
just to wrap

634
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,760
everything up here's some closing

635
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,840
thoughts

636
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,080
being in a cyber security industry is

637
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
more than just hacking

638
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,559
and it really is it's it's more than

639
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,000
just being almost a robot

640
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it involves many things such as

641
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
translating security to the business

642
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
risk and business impact

643
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,799
putting importance in soft skills

644
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,320
and being compassionate to others and to

645
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,919
yourself especially throughout your

646
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,159
journey

647
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,159
and really if you notice these are just

648
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,159
simple and basic principles

649
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,360
but it doesn't mean that they're less

650
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
valuable you know

651
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
they're often overlooked but

652
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
they are still very valuable in our

653
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
industry

654
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
and that is it that is all i have for

655
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,880
