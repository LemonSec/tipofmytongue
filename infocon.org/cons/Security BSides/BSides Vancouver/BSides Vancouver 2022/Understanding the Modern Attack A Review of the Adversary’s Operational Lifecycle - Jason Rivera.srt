1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,199
talk in a bit

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,720
awesome thanks appreciate it and thank

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,560
you for everyone for attending this uh

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
the basic premise of what i'm talking

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,559
about today is some of the more advanced

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,240
capabilities that we're observing the

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,679
adversary leverage

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,160
and this goes beyond like your classic

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
criminal extortion ransomware nation

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
state espionage and really what my goal

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
in my goal in making this presentation

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,199
was to create and give some ideas around

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
some of the commonalities that we're

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
seeing around a lot of the more advanced

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
attacks so that's kind of what we're

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
shooting for today

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,760
as a quick introduction my name is jason

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,440
and i lead a team at crowdstrike called

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
the strategic threat advisory group

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
basically what our team does is we help

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,399
our customers understand adversarial

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,239
threats to their environment prior to

23
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,520
crowdstrike i used to work for a big

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,879
four consulting firm where i used to

25
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,480
build threat intelligence programs for

26
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,079
fortune 500 companies and government

27
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,079
agencies and prior to that i was in the

28
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,079
us army for approximately seven years as

29
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,600
an intelligence officer places like the

30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
nsa and cyber command

31
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
so enough about me let's talk a little

32
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
bit about the agenda and we'll be going

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,840
over this thing called the offense the

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
adversary offensive operations model and

35
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,600
then we're going to give various

36
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,320
examples from this operational model on

37
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,360
the different things that we're seeing

38
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
adversaries do again not only from a

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
criminal perspective not only from a

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
nation-state perspective but really

41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
across the board

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,759
and when we think about who those

43
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,159
adversaries are they typically manifest

44
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
manifest across three motivation types

45
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
nation-state e-crime and hacktivist and

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,439
the basic difference between what we see

47
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,600
is around motive so for example a

48
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
nation-state actor might be motivated by

49
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,479
espionage and national security economic

50
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
well-being geopolitics whereas an

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
e-crime adversary one might be

52
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
financially motivated and therefore

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,560
engages in financially motivated attacks

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
hacktivists are ideologically motivated

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
and of course accordingly engage in

56
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,799
these ideologically motivated attacks

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,880
uh normally you really only see like

58
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
nation-states and e-crime kind of

59
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,079
playing those bigger roles

60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
but lately especially with the outbreak

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,000
of the russia ukraine conflict we have

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
seen a lot more hacktivists on both

63
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,040
sides of the equation

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
so very much so all three actor types

65
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
are a very prevalent part of today's

66
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,320
modern threat

67
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
so let's take a look at kind of the

68
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,720
overarching issue we'll talk about like

69
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
why why is this such a challenge right

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
why are these different attacks and

71
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,599
these more advanced procedures why do

72
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,440
they present such a challenge for us as

73
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
defenders

74
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
and one way to kind of think of this is

75
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,319
to think about how the threat landscape

76
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
has evolved over time and what you will

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
find is that the more this landscape

78
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
evolves the faster it requires us to

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,400
respond so if we go all the way back in

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
the day back to viruses and worms and

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
the amount of time it took for things to

82
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
respond basically the adversary used to

83
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,560
operate at a much slower rate and then

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
slowly but surely as they leverage these

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,879
automated threats they were able to

86
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,879
quickly ramp up their their the speed of

87
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,319
their attacks

88
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,599
not only by using these automated

89
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
capabilities but by working together as

90
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
business units and that's sort of what

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
we're seeing nowadays it's like a lot of

92
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
these adversary groups they're not just

93
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
doing operations autonomously rather

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,879
they're specializing in different areas

95
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
and then they're partnering with other

96
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,640
criminal entities and other espionage

97
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,879
entities who specialize in other areas

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,040
that they're not good at and by by

99
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
combining their efforts they're able to

100
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
create a much more holistic much more

101
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
threatening issue and that's kind of

102
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
what leads us to where we're at today

103
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,239
it's where we're literally in a place

104
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
where we have minutes to respond and

105
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
this isn't just like a theory like no

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
this is the reality of what you're

107
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
seeing and what you are looking at on

108
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
this slide is something called the the

109
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
uh kind of well obviously the miter

110
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
attack framework but i'm going to

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
introduce a term called the breakout

112
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,480
time the breakout time is a critical

113
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,840
area that i think we need to pay

114
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
attention to as we are dissecting this

115
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,480
modern attack and basically the breakout

116
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
time is how long it takes the adversary

117
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
once they gain access to move laterally

118
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
because once they gain access you still

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
have a lot of opportunities to stop them

120
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
especially during that post exploitation

121
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,120
phase but once they move laterally and

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
once they're able to achieve a broader

123
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
series of objectives that's when we

124
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,400
really get into trouble

125
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,599
and that's when you have this thing

126
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,959
called the breakout time right because

127
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,319
once they have that lateral movement

128
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,599
it's much easier for them to achieve

129
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,959
their objectives

130
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,239
so at crowdstrike we created something

131
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,879
called the 11060 rule and although this

132
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,239
sounds good from obviously like a

133
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,840
marketing standpoint you know like oh

134
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
yeah one 1060. this is actually the

135
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,599
reality of what we are seeing and this

136
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,680
is why we recommend this so that is one

137
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,199
minute to detect 10 minutes to

138
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
investigate 60 minutes to respond and

139
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
again this is not a theory this is a

140
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
fact uh one of the best well-known

141
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
examples that we've seen in this is the

142
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
breakout time of the modern e-crime

143
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
adversary so again i think one of the

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,759
things that really illustrates this is

145
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,880
just looking at the difference in

146
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
breakout time between 2018 to where it

147
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
was at in 2021

148
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,360
so in 2018 what we were saying is that

149
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,919
it took the average e-crime adversary 9

150
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,720
hours and 42 minutes to break out which

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
again is to move laterally elevate

152
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
privileges really get that elevated

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,479
level of access

154
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
whereas in 2021 it took those same

155
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
adversary types one hour and 38 minutes

156
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
so again think about this right they

157
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
went from nine hours and 42 minutes

158
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,320
three years ago down to one hour and 38

159
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
minutes within a simply a three year

160
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,039
time span that is a very intense rate of

161
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
evolution and if you take that and you

162
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
compare it against the 2021 infosec team

163
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,560
remediation timeline yeah 162 hours uh

164
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,919
it's not gonna cut it and that's why

165
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,360
we're talking about this conversation

166
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
that's why we're doing this today is

167
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
because the adversary is moving at

168
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,800
lightning fast speeds and our goal as

169
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
intelligence and cyber security

170
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
professionals is to not only understand

171
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
how and why they're moving at these

172
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,919
speeds but what can we do to stop them

173
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,120
and you know another area that's really

174
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
complicating things is the use of

175
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,440
malware versus malware free attacks

176
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
as you can see in 2021 according to

177
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
crowdstrike collections only 38 of what

178
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
we saw was malware based the other 62

179
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
being malware free and when i say

180
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
malware freedom i mean living off the

181
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,400
land these hands-on keyboard techniques

182
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,199
i mean powershell command line ps exec

183
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,440
rdp brute forcing there's lots of things

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
that the adversary can do that do not

185
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
require the use of signatures and when

186
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
they avoid using signatures and when

187
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
they avoid using executables that makes

188
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
it much harder for you as a defender to

189
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
actually find their activities and

190
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,639
that's why the adversary is adapting in

191
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,160
the way that they do

192
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
so this gets me to my next slide which

193
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,720
is the adversary offensive operations

194
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,680
model

195
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
and what i am encouraging my customers

196
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,360
to do to the greatest degree that they

197
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
can is to start conceiving of their

198
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
adversary as a complex operation not

199
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,199
necessarily just as a piece of malware

200
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
but rather a much more holistic

201
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
operation particularly across three

202
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
phases and you will notice that every

203
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,720
single adversary whether they are of the

204
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,039
espionage variety the e-crime variety or

205
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,720
even the hacktivist they will all

206
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,960
operate in this three-phased manner

207
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,600
phase one being access operations so how

208
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
are they going to get in are they going

209
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
to use valid credentials will be supply

210
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
chain multi-factor authentication bypass

211
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,680
zero day exploitation so on and so forth

212
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
and then once they're in how are they

213
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
going to move laterally how are they

214
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
going to remain stealthy how are they

215
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,319
going to use these hands-on keyboard

216
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,680
techniques in order to escalate

217
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,759
privileges adequately explore their

218
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,919
environment which of course sets them up

219
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
for the third stage which is objective

220
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,280
execution

221
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
this is what we want to prevent the

222
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
adversary from getting from getting to

223
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,639
of course we want to prevent ransomware

224
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
in our environments of course we want to

225
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
prevent valuable data from being

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
exfiltrated whether it be by nation

227
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
states or e-crime actors but again

228
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
that's why this is a three-phase model

229
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
because if we're putting all of our eggs

230
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
in the prevention basket

231
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
well the challenge is one day we are

232
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
going to get surprised so the goal is to

233
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
not put all of our eggs in the

234
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
prevention basket and to really think

235
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
from an adversarial standpoint what are

236
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,759
the different areas across access

237
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
post exploitation and objective

238
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
execution that we as defenders can help

239
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,960
ideally preempt our adversary's actions

240
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
in

241
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,160
so let's talk about that first phase

242
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,199
which is you know the how are the

243
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,039
adversaries getting in which is access

244
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,440
operations so i'm going to present i i

245
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
like to be very

246
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
data driven whenever i can

247
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,759
and

248
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,800
you know you've probably been hearing a

249
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
lot lately like oh yeah identity big

250
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
part of the problem identity you know

251
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
leaked identities whether it's brute

252
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,000
force credentials or access brokers or

253
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
an improperly configured password uh

254
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
lack of multi-factor authentication

255
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,319
you've probably heard a lot lately that

256
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,160
identity is a large source of the

257
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,039
problem

258
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
and i am here to say this not only

259
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
qualitatively but quantitatively like

260
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,840
yes val valid credentials identity is in

261
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,000
fact the primary problem and what you

262
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,759
are looking at is crowdstrike intrusion

263
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,639
telemetry from the year 2021 and what we

264
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,160
have done is we took every single

265
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,599
technique that we detected across the

266
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
miter attack framework and we

267
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
superimposed it on a heat map the heat

268
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,599
map is very self-explanatory

269
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
white means we didn't see it

270
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
green means we saw it less red mean we

271
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
saw it a lot so what are we saying here

272
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
well certainly we're saying we saw a lot

273
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
of use of valid accounts which kind of

274
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,080
makes sense you know you think about

275
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
like well what has happened over the

276
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
last couple years well i'll tell you two

277
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
things have happened too very well a lot

278
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
lots of things have happened but two big

279
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,600
things have happened that have

280
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
fundamentally altered the cyber threat

281
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,640
landscape the first thing is covet 19

282
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
and when you think about what code 19

283
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
did well yeah it kind of sent all of us

284
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
home and despite the fact that it sent

285
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
us home work didn't stop no we just kind

286
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
of logged in remotely we rdp vpn used

287
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,480
software as a service used

288
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
infrastructure service which brings me

289
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,880
to my next point these as a service type

290
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,519
alliances not only by large corporations

291
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
but large government entities so not

292
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,200
only are many of us now working from

293
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
home but now we have this greatly

294
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
expanded cloud attack surface all of

295
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
these things which favor an adversary

296
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
who is seeking to exploit identities

297
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
because to get into any of these areas

298
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
all you simply have to do especially if

299
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
there's no multi-fact authentication is

300
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
have a valid username and password which

301
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
can be achieved in many numbers of ways

302
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
and which of course are also a core part

303
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
of how adversaries move laterally find

304
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
active directory in terms of your

305
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
ransomware adversaries so again identity

306
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,040
is a huge part of the problem and like i

307
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
said i wanted to show this

308
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
quantitatively not just qualitatively

309
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
and then the question is well if

310
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,000
identity the big part of the problem

311
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
then like well how what are the methods

312
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,279
how are the adversaries actually doing

313
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
this and some of it's pretty basic you

314
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
know like yeah spam fishing like a lot a

315
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,040
lot of the common stuff that we've

316
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,959
always known about for a very long time

317
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
continues to be a very prevalent way of

318
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
getting in uh and what we have noticed

319
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
lately is a lot more investment by

320
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,880
adversaries and really thinking about

321
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
like what is the best way to fish what

322
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,399
are the best themes what are the best

323
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
campaigns the best emails um you know i

324
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
saw one i think it was like last week or

325
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,519
the week before that it was done by the

326
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,519
uh by the indian government and what

327
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
they were doing was they were falsifying

328
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,079
an official document relating to the

329
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,640
russia ukraine conflict and they passed

330
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
that document over to a pakistani target

331
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
and their intent in passing that over

332
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
was to take advantage of the situation

333
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
situation in russia and ukraine create

334
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,519
this very real looking document but then

335
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,519
fish that in order to gain that initial

336
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,600
access so that's what i mean when i say

337
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
that the adversary is really thinking

338
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
about what they're doing right they're

339
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,519
thinking about what's going on in the

340
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
world they're thinking about the target

341
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,320
they're going after and they're

342
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
tailoring everything to be highly

343
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,920
tactical and highly specified to the

344
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
target that they're getting in

345
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
sometimes the adversary is just using

346
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
brute force and this is very very common

347
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
with some of these insecure cloud

348
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
environments especially these open

349
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
kubernetes clusters are temporary open

350
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
image containers where cloud developers

351
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
are opening temporary environments that

352
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
yes are defended by a username and

353
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
password but oftentimes a very hastily

354
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
created username and password or one

355
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
that's not being properly enforced which

356
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,120
of course begs for the opportunity of

357
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
the adversary to engage in these brute

358
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
forcing tactics

359
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,079
another big one that we've seen is a

360
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
significant elevation in access broker

361
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,079
activity an access broker being an

362
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,399
individual that specializes in gaining

363
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
and maintaining access into a target

364
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
environment up until the point until

365
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
where they can sell that access so an

366
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,399
access broker is one of those examples

367
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,839
of that specialization that i was

368
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,480
talking about again groups aren't trying

369
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
to do everything themselves they're kind

370
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,639
of specializing in one area or the other

371
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
and then working together to form a more

372
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
collaborative more dangerous criminal

373
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
and enterprise

374
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
again i love data and going back to kind

375
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
of this data driven approach you know

376
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
let's talk about access brokers and what

377
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,959
you are looking at is the geographic uh

378
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,440
extent of access broker targeting that

379
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
we saw between january to march 2021 and

380
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
january to march 2022 and what we're

381
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
basically doing is we're comparing kind

382
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
of the beginning of this year to the

383
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
beginning of last year and i think

384
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,680
there's been some very notable shifts

385
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,519
the blue is 2021 the orange is 2022.

386
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
the most obvious thing and again i'm not

387
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
a statistician i'm not a math genius but

388
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
i can kind of look at the graphs and be

389
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,639
like yep that's a statistically bigger

390
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
number you know that's a 600 percent

391
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,200
increase in europe that's a 200 increase

392
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,079
in north america a 300 increase in south

393
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,160
america so on and so forth like these

394
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,639
are massive it's not just like a 50

395
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,519
60 increase like no multiple hundreds of

396
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,440
percentage points increase across the

397
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
board across the world so that's the

398
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
geographic perspective of access brokers

399
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
and unfortunately it's kind of more of

400
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,839
the same when it comes to the sector

401
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,720
perspective again massive increases just

402
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,519
look at

403
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
look at academic for example like i i

404
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
can't even count that high that's like a

405
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
thousand percent increase or something

406
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
bigger than that but again really across

407
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
the board you know agriculture

408
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,279
automotive energy financial services

409
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,360
especially financial services and what

410
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
this is really illustrating is that the

411
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,839
technique is working whenever you see

412
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,240
criminals do more of something what

413
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
that's indicating is like yeah that

414
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
thing that we're doing more of it's

415
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
working so we're going to continue to do

416
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
more of it like if you ever wonder why

417
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
ransomware keeps getting worse well yeah

418
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
ransomware keeps getting worse because

419
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
it's working amazingly and they're

420
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
getting all sorts of ransom payments and

421
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,639
all sorts of funds and it's kind of the

422
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,720
same thing with access broker activities

423
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
you will notice that the adversary will

424
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
continue to favor techniques that work

425
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,000
and help them progress across that

426
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
adversary operational timeline

427
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
so again access brokers that's a huge

428
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
one i would certainly be focused on dark

429
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
web monitoring and certainly monitoring

430
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
for these keywords and these indications

431
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
of how you can catch these access

432
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
brokers uh if you want more information

433
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
on exactly how to do that dark web

434
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,680
monitoring uh you know feel free to

435
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,839
reach out to your i don't know local

436
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,120
intelligence professional if you don't

437
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
got one of those talk to crowdstrike or

438
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
whoever other your whoever else your

439
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
vendors are but in general i would

440
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,920
certainly invest in your understanding

441
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,600
of access brokers but more importantly

442
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
how to stop them

443
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,079
supply chain you know no surprise uh

444
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,199
last year especially during the

445
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,639
beginning of the year we were dealing

446
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,160
with the fallout of the solar winds

447
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,800
event and really the challenge here is

448
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
kind of the trusted relationship nature

449
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
of this and i think you know as we're

450
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,440
doing business to do business these days

451
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
it requires trust we trust our software

452
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
providers our hardware providers we

453
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,639
trust our vendors yet it is this same

454
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
exact trust that is being manipulated by

455
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
the adversary in order for them to gain

456
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
access to our environments

457
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
um in terms of what to do about this

458
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,199
this is a tough one because we can't

459
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,760
just like not trust but what we can do

460
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,320
is trust but verify i am going to

461
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
provide you a three-part solution to a

462
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
supply chain compromise attack and by

463
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,639
implementing this three-part solution

464
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,079
you will be that much more defended

465
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,000
against these types of attacks

466
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
part one

467
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
collect intelligence on previous supply

468
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,240
chain attacks my logic is very simple

469
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
future supply chain attacks are likely

470
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
to resemble previous supply chain

471
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
attacks your knowledge of previous

472
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
supply chain attacks will help you know

473
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240
what to look for in future supply chain

474
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
attacks which begs the question what do

475
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,399
we look for and what i would contend the

476
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,839
number one thing that you could possibly

477
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
look for would be in the software realm

478
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,360
but specifically within the software

479
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
realm i would contend that you are

480
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,680
looking at the before and after of these

481
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
software updates and you are monitoring

482
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the performance of the application

483
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
specifically two things how is the

484
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
application communicating and how is the

485
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
application modifying files within my

486
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,480
environment because if it's

487
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
communicating and modifying files in a

488
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
similar manner before the update as it

489
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
was after the update okay you're

490
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
probably good to go but if it's suddenly

491
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
communicating all sorts of data and then

492
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
modifying files in very weird ways after

493
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
the update

494
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,959
okay maybe we want to investigate that

495
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,720
one further which leads me to my last

496
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
method which is threat hunting so again

497
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,079
we need something to look at right we

498
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,600
need to actually go at it look at it and

499
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
see what's going on so again this is a

500
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,920
three-part solution part one

501
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
intelligence on previous supply chain

502
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,880
attacks part two log the updates and the

503
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
performance of the software as it does

504
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,279
updates part three that hunt against

505
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,519
those updates to seek for anomalies

506
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,720
that's one of the best things that you

507
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,839
can do to mitigate those types of

508
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,959
attacks

509
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,839
um

510
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,079
let's do another one let's do a cloud

511
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
one

512
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,920
and what we're noticing here is that

513
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
particularly for your more sophisticated

514
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,079
adversaries they've excelled at gaining

515
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,480
access to one area of the network but

516
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
then using different types of procedures

517
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,800
and capabilities to bypass access into

518
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,199
other areas so in this specific example

519
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,720
what we observed was an adversary that

520
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
crowdstrike refers to as cozy bear cozy

521
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,279
bear is a russian adversary that focuses

522
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,000
on access enablement operations not only

523
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
is this adversary heavily involved in

524
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
the cloud but they are also the same

525
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
ones that perpetrated the solarwinds

526
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
attack

527
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
and with this particular event what we

528
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
observed them do was gain access to a

529
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,000
microsoft 365 email environment once

530
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,199
they gained access and they did this

531
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,119
through a cloud entry node they were

532
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,959
able to bypass multi-factor

533
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
authentication policies on other

534
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
accounts associated within this email

535
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,359
enterprise and then what they did was

536
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
they reused the authentication cookies

537
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,400
held within the credential store of the

538
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
chrome browser to again just bypass the

539
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
mfa requirement

540
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,919
so here's what we're looking at here

541
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,679
we're looking at an adversary that got

542
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
in by brute forcing in one area of a

543
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
cloud environment they then gained

544
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,880
access to the multi-factor

545
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
authentication policies of the microsoft

546
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,679
365 environment shut those down and then

547
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
allowed other secondary and tertiary

548
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,240
access points in other areas so what

549
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
this really speaks to is the need to

550
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
kind of like treat cloud like it's your

551
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,919
stuff but somewhere else so yeah let me

552
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,120
say that one again

553
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
the cloud is your stuff

554
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
but somewhere else and just like you

555
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
would protect your stuff if your stuff

556
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
is somewhere else whether it's

557
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
infrastructure as a service platform as

558
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,679
a service software as a service uh yeah

559
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
we still need to protect it right which

560
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,799
gets me back to my identity point

561
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,640
because how are you accessing these

562
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
software as a services how are you

563
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
accessing infrastructure as a service my

564
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
guess is you are logging in with an

565
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,679
identity i hope that identity has

566
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
multi-factor authentication i hope your

567
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,960
cloud infrastructure is properly

568
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
protected because these are the things

569
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,760
that our adversaries are taking

570
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
advantage of they're looking for the

571
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
low-hanging fruit they're taking

572
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,360
advantage of the chaos whether it's

573
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,039
cloud compromise or identity based

574
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,960
compromise zero-day vulnerability

575
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,320
compromise which is one that we didn't

576
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
talk about our adversary is watching us

577
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
and they're looking at the rapidly

578
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,559
expanding attack surface and what

579
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,320
they're doing is they're focusing their

580
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,400
efforts in any areas where we're not

581
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
paying attention or any areas where we

582
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
seem overwhelmed like the cloud like

583
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
with these different vulnerabilities are

584
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
popping up that is where they're really

585
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,240
applying their efforts so our capacity

586
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
to be aware of this and to preemptively

587
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
issue measures that stop them is

588
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,360
critical in order to combat that

589
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
let's move on to the next phase which is

590
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
the post-exploitation area

591
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,600
so

592
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,120
you know i think post-exploitation is

593
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,559
important right because like here's the

594
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,080
thing

595
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
you're not always going to stop the

596
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,600
adversary from getting in and i think

597
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
this is a reality that we need to be

598
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
better at accepting you are not going to

599
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
stop every phishing attack you are not

600
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,120
going to stop every zero-day

601
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
vulnerability attack

602
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
you are not going to stop every supply

603
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,640
chain attack there are a million initial

604
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
access attacks that you are not going to

605
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
stop

606
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
and when we come to this realization

607
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,640
when we say to ourselves you know what

608
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,799
yeah it is possible for them to get in

609
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,640
that leads to the next and very most

610
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
obvious question which is if they're

611
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
going to get in how am i going to stop

612
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,919
them well i think one area we're

613
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,520
thinking through is well do we know what

614
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,320
they're going to do when they're going

615
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,280
to get in

616
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
and what i'm showing you is a series of

617
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
techniques that have been observed by

618
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
crowdstrike hunting capability called

619
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
overwatch and what we did was we looked

620
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
at the most popular techniques being

621
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
used by the adversary the fileless ones

622
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,679
specifically and we're really focusing

623
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,080
on those and when it comes to the use of

624
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
these techniques for post exploitation

625
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
we see the use of compromised

626
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,440
credentials so oftentimes they'll gain

627
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
access use compromised credentials to

628
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,880
move laterally again which speaks to

629
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
that identity-based solution

630
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,559
they're using ps exec in order to do a

631
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,840
light telemate

632
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,679
telnet kind of a lateral movement into

633
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,080
other areas throughout the network

634
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
native binaries that's a big one

635
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
oftentimes we'll see the adversary just

636
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
kind of manipulate native binaries

637
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
manipulate file shares manipulate

638
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
registry keys and the reason they're

639
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
doing this is kind of like i said

640
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,880
earlier they don't want to set off any

641
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,080
red flags they don't want to set off

642
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
your signature-based defenses so they're

643
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,559
going to do things they're going to

644
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,240
avoid that

645
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,600
power shell that's a big one you know

646
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
hands on keyboard command line uh using

647
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,320
capabilities that can they can call down

648
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,919
the effects that you want as opposed to

649
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,200
having to use malware to achieve the

650
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
effects and then the last one being the

651
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,320
abuse of legitimate network

652
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
administration tools uh again

653
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
thematically our adversaries want to

654
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
take advantage of the environment in

655
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
front of them they want to live off the

656
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,000
land which is the term that crowdstrike

657
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,840
will often use to describe this and if

658
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
they're going to live off the land well

659
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
then we need capabilities that detect

660
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
that living off the land capabilities

661
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,720
like next generation av and edr but more

662
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,559
importantly threat hunting because

663
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,600
here's the thing it's kind of like i

664
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
said earlier you are not going to stop

665
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,679
all of them from getting in but surely

666
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,120
we can put people on the ground and we

667
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,799
can employ professionals who understand

668
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
this environment to engage in this

669
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,840
critical threat hunting activities that

670
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,919
are designed to stop the adversary

671
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,360
by the way when i say threat hunting i

672
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,400
mean the 24 7 365 variety not the

673
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
part-time one that you do when you want

674
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,919
to do from nine to five but again the 24

675
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,159
7 365 variety

676
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,880
why do i say 24 7 365 well that's how

677
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
your adversary operates your adversary

678
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,400
knows when your weekends are they know

679
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
when your holidays are in fact their

680
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,760
favorite thing to do is to attack you on

681
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
your weekends and your holidays if you

682
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,440
want the best example of that go back to

683
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,799
the cassaya ransomware attack that

684
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
occurred last year

685
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,039
1800 different victims between united

686
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
states and europe and other locations

687
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
all hit simultaneously

688
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,679
all over the fourth of july weekend a

689
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,080
very very intentional attack and for

690
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
reasons such as that that is why i

691
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,320
recommend 24 7 365 threat hunting

692
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
so again just some more observations

693
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,960
around what we're seeing from a living

694
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
off the land perspective here's a more

695
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
recent update of the stuff we're seeing

696
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
you know again a lot a lot of these a

697
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,679
lot of these things where where you use

698
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,760
it where we're using native tools the

699
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,919
environment processdom powershell

700
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,600
windows management instrumentation ps

701
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
exec as well as some non-native tools

702
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
that they're leveraging in order to

703
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
again use these tools to move laterally

704
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,400
and achieve those post-exploitation

705
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,720
objectives

706
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,320
and while though this is broad guidance

707
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,159
around what the adversary is doing this

708
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,600
is why consuming intelligence around

709
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
what they are specifically doing is

710
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
important because i can show you a slide

711
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
all day long

712
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
but for you to take action on this slide

713
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
requires you to have a greater degree of

714
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
specificity around what exactly to look

715
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
for

716
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
so what we're looking in this case is an

717
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
example kind of like a hybrid example so

718
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,760
in the last section i talked about how

719
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,159
cozy bear was gaining access uh via

720
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,440
cloud environments and then using that

721
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,280
to open up additional initial access

722
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
vectors what we're talking about here is

723
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,039
something very similar but instead of

724
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,559
using it to open up additional access

725
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,720
vectors they're using it to facilitate

726
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,000
lateral movement

727
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
so the interesting thing is that the

728
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,120
adversary can sometimes do the same

729
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,559
thing but achieve two different

730
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,720
objectives sometimes an initial access

731
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
objective sometimes more of a post

732
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,640
exploitation objective again it's one of

733
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
those things where you kind of have to

734
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,520
have the awareness like the overarching

735
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,679
awareness of how are they using it what

736
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,120
is what is common for them in terms of

737
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
how they use it and then your ability to

738
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,559
actually detect it which is why i'm such

739
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,240
a huge proponent of intelligence because

740
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,360
intelligence is what helps you

741
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
understand what has happened in the past

742
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,640
again something i always tell my

743
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
customers is the thing that's most

744
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
likely to happen to you tomorrow is

745
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,279
whatever happened to your buddy that

746
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,320
looks like you yesterday

747
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
so here's an example of you know native

748
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
tooling and again this is uh i'm showing

749
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
you several different views of the same

750
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
thing and my purpose here in showing you

751
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
these different views is to give you the

752
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,159
different perspectives of how the

753
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
adversary might approach and treat your

754
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
environment so specifically when it

755
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
comes to post exploitation the goal is

756
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,080
really to stop them in these phases here

757
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,840
whether it's lateral movement defensive

758
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,679
agent persistence and these are things

759
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,039
that you're going to see the adversary

760
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,120
do time and time again perhaps using

761
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
slightly different mechanisms different

762
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
commands different ttps and protocols

763
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,320
but again with the overarching and the

764
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
same purpose and especially when you can

765
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
get to the point to where

766
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
you are used to specific adversary types

767
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
that's when you can really get to the

768
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,799
realm of predictability

769
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,320
because especially with your criminal

770
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,679
actors and some of your nation state

771
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,559
actors

772
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,760
it's not like they're going to reinvent

773
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,000
the wheel every time they do these these

774
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
things in fact they're going to kind of

775
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
do whatever has worked in the past

776
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,799
that's how they become efficient that's

777
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,640
how they scale in the same way that we

778
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
want to be efficient and scale the

779
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
adversary also wants to be efficient in

780
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
scale so that's why having that

781
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,039
understanding of how they're likely to

782
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,720
engage in these attacks is so critical

783
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,640
to stopping them

784
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
let's go into the last portion of the

785
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,279
brief which is around objective

786
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,520
execution so like this is the end state

787
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
right we want to prevent the bad stuff

788
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
from happening to us but remember what i

789
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,039
said earlier to prevent the end state to

790
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
prevent all the bad stuff from happening

791
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
to the end you kind of want to act to

792
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
the left as well

793
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,440
so what i always tell my customers is

794
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,799
you know go go as far to the left as

795
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,640
possible you know if you can stop them

796
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
at sorry i know i'm flipping slides all

797
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,559
crazy but if you can stop them from

798
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,240
gaining access if you can't stop them

799
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
from gaining access stop them from post

800
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,320
exploitation and then only after you've

801
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
exhausted that then yes we must prevent

802
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
but again ideally we are moving to the

803
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,840
left as far as we possibly

804
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,880
can so let's talk about objective

805
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
execution here and this is really you

806
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
know quote unquote the bad stuff that's

807
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
happening right and i'm going to provide

808
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
several different examples of this

809
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
across several different current

810
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,159
conflicts uh the first and probably most

811
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,000
center to a lot of people's minds is

812
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,320
what's going on in russia and ukraine

813
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,400
and basically what it boils down to is

814
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
russia is doing all sorts of stuff but

815
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
you can kind of categorize all of it

816
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
into three broad categories uh the first

817
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
is information disruption which is

818
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,720
exactly as it sounds it's ddos it's but

819
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
it's not just ddos it's also like

820
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,520
cutting

821
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
telecommunication lines and doing some

822
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
of those physical attacks too like i

823
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
read something like it was like maybe

824
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,799
two weeks ago or week ago there was some

825
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,039
like communication lines cut in both

826
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
france and moldova

827
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
the french one could potentially be

828
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,640
vandalism uh the moldova one given the

829
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
proximity to ukraine

830
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
feels a little bit more like a

831
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,400
russian-based attack but then again i do

832
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
want a perfectly caveat that we do not

833
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
have any

834
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,880
existing information to suggest that it

835
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
was for sure the russians but certainly

836
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
from a motive standpoint the moldova one

837
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,480
does stand out uh but yeah that's kind

838
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,279
of what we want to think of when we

839
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,799
think of information disruption it's

840
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,880
like the ability the ability to deny

841
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
access to certain types of cyber

842
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
resources

843
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,159
information destruction is another big

844
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,240
one and this is manifesting in several

845
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,159
different forms uh well really three

846
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,320
different forms there's ransomware

847
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
there's

848
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
wiper destruction like data destruction

849
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,440
and then there's literally like physical

850
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,559
destruction

851
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,320
and the russian adversary types that we

852
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
are tracking are certainly capable of

853
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,200
all three and have recently demonstrated

854
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,520
all three even during the course of this

855
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
current conflict it started off with

856
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
ransomware and then it sort of evolved

857
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
into more of these wipers and physically

858
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
destructive attacks uh but again very

859
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,720
much so it is something that is

860
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,960
happening uh there is some concern of

861
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
seeing like kind of like a not petya 2.0

862
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,320
type thing happen because some of the

863
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
wipers have worm-like functionality

864
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
built into them and i'm sure most of us

865
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,679
are familiar with what that means but

866
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,440
for those of us who are not

867
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,640
basically when i say worm-like

868
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
functionality i mean the ability to

869
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
self-propagate uh which is a feature

870
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,760
that we've seen not only in this current

871
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
course of attacks but also of course in

872
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
previous russian attacks like not petya

873
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,320
and then lastly there's information

874
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,799
operations which again is exactly as it

875
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,720
sounds it is the ability to control

876
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,880
information not only internally with

877
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,919
their own population but externally so

878
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,200
for example in the internal world of

879
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
russia uh they're

880
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
living in a parallel universe where uh

881
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,399
trying to think of how to say this uh

882
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,440
basically i'll just kind of say it like

883
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,039
this uh they are working on controlling

884
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,039
information to a very extreme degree

885
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
they're limiting social media limiting

886
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,919
uh official news newscasting channels

887
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,279
distorting the message and they're doing

888
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,799
this not only internally to control

889
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,760
their own population but also externally

890
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
uh they are directing these external

891
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
campaigns of course towards western

892
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,559
governments like the united states and

893
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,559
european governments but also towards

894
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,399
the ukrainians themselves towards

895
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,640
eastern european entities uh a lot of it

896
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,039
for the purpose of demoralizing uh

897
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,279
creating chaos trying to cause internal

898
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,600
infighting so again when we talk about

899
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,520
this objective execution this is what

900
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,840
this last phase looks like it's when you

901
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,919
get all the way there you've done all

902
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,200
the initial access you've done all the

903
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,880
post exploitation and now you're

904
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,720
achieving the objective and again this

905
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,840
is kind of what we want to stop the

906
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,559
adversary from achieving

907
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
um another one of the more notable areas

908
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,799
that where we've seen is a risk to

909
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,200
different types of american power

910
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,000
providers uh we have recently received

911
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,559
reporting from sensitive sources aka

912
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,679
honey pots and other types of

913
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
capabilities that we don't talk too much

914
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,600
about that basically we are observing

915
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,760
russian based actors targeting

916
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
uninterruptible power supply

917
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,960
within different substations

918
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
in terms of why they would do this they

919
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
would do this for retaliatory purposes

920
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
they would do this for escalation

921
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,640
purposes and the way that they would do

922
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,799
this is one through using default

923
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,320
credentials which might blow your mind

924
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,760
but yeah there are a lot of default

925
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,679
credentials to where administrators are

926
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,919
just kind of logging in remotely

927
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,600
bridging the air gap with default

928
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
credentials which sounds like pure

929
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,720
madness but yes that is happening all

930
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
the time and they're also using high

931
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,240
profile vulnerabilities

932
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,440
these vulnerabilities are designed to

933
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
achieve remote code execution so again

934
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,960
i'm showing this example because i want

935
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,159
to show what the full spectrum looks

936
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,080
like the initial access might be the

937
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,159
vulnerability exploitation or the use of

938
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
default credentials and then as they're

939
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,600
moving laterally they're trying to find

940
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
out where these switches are how do i

941
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,120
actually affect you know this electrical

942
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,559
power enterprise right because it's one

943
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,320
thing to gain access to the environment

944
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
but it's another thing to actually know

945
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,200
where you're going within these ot

946
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,440
environments to successfully shut down

947
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,320
power

948
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,840
i do want to caveat that this was not a

949
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,760
successful attack but rather we are

950
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
seeing these attempted compromise

951
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,399
attempts

952
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,679
but again i did want to show this

953
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,720
example because it's a nice full

954
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,159
spectrum example of the realm of the

955
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,640
possible

956
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
so with this next one we're looking at

957
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,600
is a uh again one of those full spectrum

958
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,200
examples this one is a chinese adversary

959
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,520
set where we're looking at an adversary

960
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
that goes after uh pretty much like

961
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,840
easter eastern uh east asian entities

962
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
focusing on taiwan india thailand hong

963
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,399
kong nepal and this one's really focused

964
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,679
on using the full spectrum of their

965
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,840
capabilities to engage in economic

966
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
espionage so with this one what you're

967
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
seeing is a variety of different types

968
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
of capabilities that are designed to get

969
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,039
it get them in so you see them focusing

970
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
on initial access going after internet

971
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,520
facing appliances deploying web shells

972
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,720
they then uh oops sorry

973
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,799
let's go back one they then maintain

974
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,159
that access to the opening of a

975
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,720
persistent web shell so again the entry

976
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
point would be these uh you know

977
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,919
internet facing appliances these

978
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
vulnerabilities

979
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,519
phishing in many cases the lateral

980
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,200
movement consists of understanding the

981
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,120
environment and opening up a persistence

982
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
capability that allows them to maintain

983
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,880
that access and then the objective

984
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,519
execution is the collection of sensitive

985
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,760
data particularly economic data that

986
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
allows them to fulfill their target

987
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,679
objectives and as you can see with the

988
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
types of data they're collecting

989
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,200
healthcare telecommunications media

990
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,240
energy aerospace military and government

991
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,840
so again this is another full spectrum

992
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,919
example i do think these full spectrum

993
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,519
examples are important because what they

994
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,360
do is they allow us to understand from

995
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
start to finish you know how are they

996
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,640
getting in how are they achieving post

997
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
exploitation and then what are they

998
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
doing once they get there and again the

999
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,919
reason i really love this three-step

1000
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,200
model is that every single step is an

1001
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
opportunity for us as defenders to stop

1002
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,200
them and the more that we understand the

1003
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,440
adversary as a function of these steps

1004
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
and the more that we're able to

1005
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,559
calculate their steps and preempt those

1006
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,640
steps the better our ability to

1007
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
proactively combat what they're doing

1008
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,080
because otherwise we're sort of just

1009
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,840
waiting for the prevention phase which

1010
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,519
is like the opposite of what we want to

1011
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,440
do we want to avoid waiting for the

1012
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,519
prevention phase and ideally get to a

1013
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,760
place to where we can you know mitigate

1014
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
them in some of the earlier phases of

1015
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
the attack life cycle

1016
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
here's another example of an adversary

1017
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,760
that has a full spectrum of capabilities

1018
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,840
to achieve their objectives with

1019
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,679
this is an adversary that we refer to as

1020
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,760
wizard spider you might better know them

1021
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,840
as the user of the ryu ransomware kanti

1022
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,080
ransomware trick bopping your trojan i

1023
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,840
think between those three terms i'm

1024
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,760
probably i've probably connected to most

1025
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,200
of the people out there in terms of who

1026
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,279
this adversary is uh but yeah i like

1027
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,640
this example because they're they're

1028
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
what i call a full spectrum uh criminal

1029
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,919
enterprise and when i say full spectrum

1030
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,399
i mean like they do everything which is

1031
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,320
actually very atypical of most criminals

1032
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,679
most criminals these days are kind of

1033
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,039
like specialists kind of like what i was

1034
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,720
saying earlier you got your ransomware

1035
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,559
specialists and your access brokers and

1036
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,679
different people that are kind of doing

1037
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,320
different things whereas this actor does

1038
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,159
it all and they have a lot they have a

1039
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,760
very large operation that they

1040
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
autonomously run and there are several

1041
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,559
objective execution several impact

1042
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,039
related items here that are causing harm

1043
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,559
so for example the obvious ones are the

1044
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,640
kanti and the ryuk ransomware obviously

1045
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,799
we want to stop those but they even have

1046
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,000
you know information collecting

1047
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,919
capabilities like saido and anchor

1048
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,440
framework which are designed to collect

1049
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,039
data which again is another form of

1050
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,120
objective execution they have magnetic

1051
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
scraper which is designed to collect

1052
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,559
credit card data which again is another

1053
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,399
form of objective execution

1054
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,320
so like i said i like this adversary

1055
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,519
example because there's a lot of

1056
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,360
different means through which they can

1057
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,440
achieve their objectives and this

1058
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
adversary like many of the other types

1059
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
that we talked about today are also

1060
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,320
capable of operating across the full

1061
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,640
spectrum of all three areas so in terms

1062
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,919
of initial access and what that might

1063
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,440
look like it might look like something

1064
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,799
like a phishing email where they use

1065
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,399
bazaar loader to gain that initial

1066
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,080
access and then once they have that

1067
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,679
access they'll either engage in living

1068
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,360
off the land or perhaps they'll use

1069
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
trick bot in order to trick about their

1070
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,519
banking trojan in order to again move

1071
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,440
laterally find the domain controller

1072
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
maximize their objectives and then of

1073
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,399
course we talked about the objective

1074
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,720
execution capabilities that they possess

1075
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,200
those being anchor framework cyto

1076
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,480
magnetic scraper conti and ryu

1077
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
so again uh i like this example because

1078
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,239
it really goes across all three phases

1079
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,560
and it helps us understand as defenders

1080
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,079
okay what are we going to really focus

1081
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,000
on how do we kind of like apply our

1082
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
efforts in the best way possible which i

1083
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,760
guess speaking of that kind of leads me

1084
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,599
to my you know final i'm going to get

1085
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
closer to kind of the finish here and

1086
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,679
again the premise of this is really to

1087
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,879
kind of focus on the adversary

1088
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
operations model right like how do

1089
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,800
advanced adversaries operate how can i

1090
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,440
apply my resources my scarce resources i

1091
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,599
might add in ways that are going to be

1092
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,918
effective in stopping the adversary

1093
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,239
uh the preview to what i will say is to

1094
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,719
think kind of like this right like if

1095
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,480
the majority of what the adversary is

1096
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
doing is using valid accounts well that

1097
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,239
applause implies that we need to focus a

1098
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,159
lot on this identity piece

1099
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
and another thing we're thinking through

1100
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
is even what we're seeing from over here

1101
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,920
with the lateral movement perspective

1102
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,560
remote services so if i were to guess

1103
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,839
and this isn't really much of a guess

1104
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,880
because i kind of know the answer on

1105
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,079
this one

1106
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,839
in terms of how they're moving laterally

1107
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,599
within these remote services

1108
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
i can almost guarantee you that most of

1109
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,079
the time yeah they're using identities

1110
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,400
so moral of the story here is like it

1111
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
seems like a large portion of the

1112
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,200
problem is identity based which means a

1113
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,119
large portion of the solution and how we

1114
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,960
think about this also needs to be

1115
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,680
identity based which brings me lastly to

1116
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
my call to action

1117
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,960
and basically it kind of goes like

1118
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,720
something like this you know we need to

1119
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
be proactive in how we understand the

1120
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
adversary

1121
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,680
if i could give you one thing today

1122
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,240
i would urge you to stop perceiving of

1123
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,760
the adversary as this reactive thing

1124
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
as a piece of malware you're going to

1125
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
hear me say the word adversary over and

1126
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,079
over and over again and you are going to

1127
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,599
always hear me whenever you hear me

1128
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,000
brief talk about the human element of

1129
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,359
the adversary

1130
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
you are fighting an opponent you are not

1131
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
fighting a machine you are not fighting

1132
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
a botnet you are not fighting a malware

1133
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,119
or malicious infrastructure all of those

1134
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,400
things are merely weapons merely tools

1135
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,200
being used by a human adversary to hold

1136
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,520
you at risk and the more you treat that

1137
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,000
adversary like a real opponent like a

1138
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
chess match the more the answer becomes

1139
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,839
exceedingly obvious because the

1140
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,680
exceedingly obvious answer that i'm sure

1141
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,880
we are all slowly coming to the

1142
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,440
conclusion of is that prevention

1143
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
and of itself

1144
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
waiting for the adversary to hold us at

1145
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,359
risk waiting for them to attack us is no

1146
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,280
longer going to be sufficient therefore

1147
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,640
we must think of the proactive

1148
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
disciplines and engage in those

1149
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
proactive disciplines things like threat

1150
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
hunting you heard me say earlier 24 7

1151
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,079
365 this is not a part-time job either

1152
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,200
you do it

1153
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,440
we do it another vendor does it or

1154
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
somebody's going to do it and if it's

1155
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,480
not one of us then it's going to be your

1156
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,640
adversary so somebody does need to do

1157
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,320
this the question is do you want to be

1158
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
you your trusted vendors or your

1159
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,760
adversary it is going to happen one way

1160
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,680
or the other we talked about identity

1161
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,839
protection again that's a big one right

1162
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,680
if 80 of the problem is identity based

1163
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,280
yeah it's not going to solve everything

1164
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,960
you still got 20 left but yeah you know

1165
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,200
let's take a giant problem-solving

1166
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
hammer and let's go smack that one and

1167
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,920
really kind of go after the identity

1168
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,119
portion of it

1169
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,160
uh adversary profiling is one that is

1170
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,320
becoming very important to me and the

1171
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
reason that i believe we need to engage

1172
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
in adversary profiling is as a function

1173
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,920
of prioritization

1174
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,400
you as a cyber security shop are not

1175
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,480
capable of focusing on every single

1176
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
problem that exists if you are focused

1177
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,119
on everything if everything is a

1178
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,359
priority well then in fact nothing is a

1179
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,599
priority and what adversary profile

1180
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,599
allows you to do with intelligence is it

1181
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,599
allows you to focus on who actually

1182
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,800
matters who is likely to hold me at risk

1183
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,760
who is capable of holding me at risk who

1184
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
is likely to go after the critical

1185
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,599
assets that i am seeking to defend and

1186
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,119
once you have that information what it

1187
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,280
allows you to do is really narrow your

1188
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,839
focus your ability to narrow your focus

1189
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,599
allows you to narrow your problem

1190
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,839
solving capability it allows you to

1191
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,000
become much more tactical and much more

1192
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,400
concise in terms of exactly what you do

1193
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,440
and for that reason i

1194
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,920
strongly recommend adversary profiling

1195
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,760
cloud workload protection you heard me

1196
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,320
say earlier the cloud is your stuff it

1197
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,000
is simply somewhere else i'll say it

1198
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,839
again the cloud is your stuff it's just

1199
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,760
somewhere else so in the same manner

1200
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,200
that you would protect your stuff in

1201
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,720
your house well then yes we should

1202
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,560
protect your stuff in other people's

1203
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,240
houses other organizations houses and i

1204
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,400
know this house metaphor may not make

1205
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,839
sense but more of the story yeah your

1206
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
stuff somewhere else so the same

1207
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
prevention the same visibility the same

1208
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
hunting the same identity and access

1209
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,640
management the same vulnerability

1210
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,320
management all the normal things that

1211
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,800
you would do apply to cloud environments

1212
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
so i do urge us to think about that how

1213
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
are you protecting your cloud

1214
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,720
environments what is your plan to do

1215
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,240
that and then lastly there's

1216
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
intelligence monitoring so you heard me

1217
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
talk earlier about access brokers and

1218
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,000
the threat of the dark web and i know

1219
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,680
the dark web it's like this big buzzword

1220
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,599
but no in real life like there are

1221
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,359
access brokers who are actively listing

1222
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,440
companies right now if you are not

1223
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,359
looking for your company being listed

1224
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,800
well then what you're basically doing is

1225
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,079
you're kind of just waiting and hoping

1226
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,240
that they don't do it uh hope is not a

1227
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,079
method so for that reason i do encourage

1228
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,320
you to have a monitoring capability

1229
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,160
again whether you do it or someone else

1230
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
does it whether you automate it this

1231
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
isn't really a vendor thing and i'm not

1232
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
trying to say which vendor should kind

1233
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,720
of do what but in general yeah it's kind

1234
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,920
of like the same way i feel about

1235
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
monitoring is the same way i feel about

1236
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,560
hunting

1237
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,480
somebody is going to do it either you're

1238
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
going to do it we're going to do it or

1239
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
your adversaries are going to do it so

1240
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,119
somebody's going to do it and it may

1241
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,720
well be us and we may as well find them

1242
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,880
before something bad happens to us

1243
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
so again those are my five

1244
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,640
recommendations i will close this with

1245
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
one of my favorite little

1246
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,359
catch phrases which is this

1247
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,520
your ability to defeat advanced cyber

1248
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
threats rests almost entirely on your

1249
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,839
understanding of the problem

1250
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,920
here's what this really boils down to if

1251
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,760
you know who the bad guy is if you know

1252
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
what they're capable of if you know what

1253
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
they're going to use and if you know how

1254
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
they're going to use it well then your

1255
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,000
chances of stopping them are

1256
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,319
astronomically higher than if you do not

1257
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,400
know any of those things and i'll leave

1258
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,760
you with this

1259
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,520
imagine if you will that you are a

1260
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,839
general of a military and you are about

1261
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
to go to war and imagine if right before

1262
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,960
you went to that war your top officer

1263
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,319
came and said to you

1264
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,640
hey sir hey ma'am sorry but i have no

1265
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,480
idea what you're about to face i don't

1266
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,839
know how many tanks they have i don't

1267
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,280
know how many aircraft they have i don't

1268
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,640
even know how many troops they have or

1269
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,839
what they're going to do

1270
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,520
so you know good luck tomorrow when you

1271
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,160
go to that battle and as crazy as that

1272
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
example i gave sounds that is what

1273
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,319
that's that's how most of us operate

1274
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,839
most of us are operating in this place

1275
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,680
where we have no idea who the adversary

1276
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,520
is and then we get surprised by breaches

1277
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
and we're like oh wow wow what happened

1278
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
well no yeah it kind of comes back to

1279
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,480
what i'm showing you on the screen like

1280
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,160
if you understand them and you know them

1281
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,079
in advance then your ability to solve

1282
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,119
the problem is going to be much more

1283
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,240
enhanced

1284
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,480
so that is all i got i did want to save

1285
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,800
about 15 minutes or so for questions at

1286
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,079
this time i'll go ahead and stop

1287
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,680
presenting my screen and then we'll uh

1288
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
go to see if any we have any questions

1289
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,919
from the from the crowd

1290
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,240
hey jason nice talk i'm just going to

1291
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,119
take a look here and see if we got

1292
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,480
another question and answer and you see

1293
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,160
there's been a bunch of people talking

1294
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
all the the whole talk there's been all

1295
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,119
kinds of uh

1296
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,800
people talking about things how about

1297
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,720
tlps and i just want to see if we got

1298
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,880
any other q and a over here

1299
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,640
i don't see any actual questions in the

1300
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,119
q a i'm just going to look through

1301
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,640
can you hear me yeah i just want to

1302
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,720
check that i have that turned up

1303
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,319
let's turn my mic up some marketing

1304

i thought that was a great talk it's

1318
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,480
very interesting thanks uh jason i don't

1319
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,000
know who does your slides your artwork

1320
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,040
but uh

1321
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,839
they need to get her

1322
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,240
they just watch it the artwork's amazing

1323
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,520
too man

1324
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,760
yeah our team actually builds it as well

1325
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
yeah i'm sure eh yeah a nice looking uh

1326
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
yeah definitely how does the cs search

1327
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,839
uh dark web how they're

1328
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,920
from justin so we we do it both in using

1329
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,839
automated as well as manual capabilities

1330
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,000
so the automated capability is think of

1331
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,440
it as like a scraper

1332
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,839
so we have a list of websites whether

1333
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,480
they're forums or malicious content

1334
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,800
hosting sites or it could be like data

1335
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
leak sites and we are constantly trying

1336
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,160
to scrape those

1337
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,520
but sometimes we can't get in right

1338
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,960
because we have an automated capability

1339
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,319
but the adversary is interested in

1340
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,160
stopping that automated capability which

1341
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,319
gets us to the human piece we have a

1342
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,480
team and basically this is a 25 person

1343
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,400
team and their job is to gain and

1344
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,680
maintain access to these different

1345
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,079
locations so if we cannot get in and

1346
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,240
using automated means then we will use a

1347
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,720
human get that human in and basically

1348
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,920
that human will do what it takes to

1349
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,839
maintain the access and then allow the

1350
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,200
automated mechanism to come back in and

1351
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,960
collect so that's kind of the gist of

1352
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,440
what we do it's a kind of like a game of

1353
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,359
cat and malice it's like we gain access

1354
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,280
we lose access we gain it again and then

1355
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,560
we have to use a different persona to

1356
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,480
come back in uh but that's kind of the

1357
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,000
general process

1358
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,960
right

1359
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,800
uh thanks justin

1360
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,760
i mean

1361
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,040
sorry

1362
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,280
thanks jason uh thanks for the question

1363
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,520
justin uh chris just a quick comment i'm

1364
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,880
not sure if we've been given permission

1365
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,640
to actually publish uh

1366
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,720
jason's slides or not and so um i'll let

1367
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,480
you know but um yes you're coming about

1368
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,880
tlp amber and his slides being marked

1369
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,560
that i'm not sure if we've even been

1370
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,079
given permission to release uh yeah let

1371
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,680
me review let me review with my

1372
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,040
marketing team

1373
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
yeah i i sort of put tlp amber on all my

1374
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,960
stuff by default yeah uh i should

1375
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,560
probably stop doing that but i guess the

1376
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,920
reason i do that though is some people

1377
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,839
don't inadvertently like do that

1378
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,280
publish my stuff so yeah let me let me

1379
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,160
check that i don't think there's

1380
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,760
anything like two sentences person yeah

1381
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,960
we'll check with you before we publish

1382
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,160
anything we definitely several of our

1383
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,440
talks are not going to be published and

1384
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
that's uh you know that's totally fine

1385
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,240
with us till the end thanks chris for

1386
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,000
bringing it up got another question from

1387
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,280
elite um

1388
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,720
um

1389
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,079
do you see an increase in an industry

1390
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,359
sector that you find particularly

1391
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,839
interesting

1392
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,598
um

1393
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,280
kind of

1394
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,119
to some degree yes i don't know if it's

1395
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,800
interesting per se but i will give you

1396
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,720
an observation from what i'm seeing from

1397
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,400
the russia ukraine

1398
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,240
conflict uh

1399
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,079
there appears to be six

1400
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,599
sectors that in a

1401
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,880
government-on-government conflict tend

1402
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,440
to be kind of more at risk than others

1403
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
and these sectors all have the thing in

1404
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,119
common like they are critical to a

1405
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,599
nation's warfighting capability so

1406
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,280
obviously the government slash military

1407
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,680
is one of them uh but financial has been

1408
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,319
another big one telecommunications

1409
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,119
energy water and health

1410
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,839
those six uh whether it be with the

1411
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,160
russia ukraine conflict or even some of

1412
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,359
the stuff that's gotten a little heated

1413
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,839
with iran before as well as china as

1414
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,680
well it's like those six over and over

1415
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,760
and over again seem to be very much so

1416
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,400
targeted during times of conflict

1417
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,079
a lot of what crowdstrike is releasing

1418
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,680
from like a sensitive source reporting

1419
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
standpoint is actually also talking

1420
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,319
about uh attacks against these specific

1421
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,200
sectors so my best understanding of this

1422
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,720
is that basically those sectors

1423
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,319
contribute to a nation's warfighting

1424
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,359
effort so like power yeah finance if you

1425
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,200
can't give money to soldiers then they

1426
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,359
can't they're not paid uh water

1427
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,560
telecommunications it's like they're

1428
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,160
going after these core areas if that

1429
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,800
makes sense so i will say that is in

1430
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,079
terms of like what we're seeing actually

1431
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,079
happen and you know and like we're

1432
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,119
relating to sector observations

1433
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,520
great got another question for you here

1434
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,280
um in your experience are some identity

1435
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
brokers more commonly targeted than

1436
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,720
others

1437
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
uh

1438
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
some sectors are more targeted than

1439
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,160
others so like an identity by identity

1440
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,359
broker i'm assuming we're talking about

1441
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,119
kind of like these access brokers and

1442
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,200
what the access brokers are doing is

1443
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,599
they are stealing identity data and then

1444
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,200
selling it but they're also stealing

1445
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,960
vulnerability data and selling that too

1446
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,839
so they're like basically they're

1447
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,440
selling the way in it's not just

1448
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,520
identity it is primarily identity but

1449
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
it's not just identity and in terms of

1450
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,160
like more activity than others i mean

1451
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,480
certainly north america is always kind

1452
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,240
of pummeled i do think it's very

1453
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,160
interesting the the i don't know if i

1454
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
well yeah i showed it earlier this the

1455
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,240
european 600 increase in european

1456
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,960
targeting uh that that threw me for a

1457
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,720
bit uh when i saw that because i didn't

1458
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,480
expect it to increase by that much

1459
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,319
um certain sectors are being pummeled

1460
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,400
more than others but it kind of looks uh

1461
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,119
it looks opportunistic to be blunt uh

1462
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,800
lots of academic

1463
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,280
lots of healthcare lots of manufacturing

1464
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,319
uh lots of state and local government

1465
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,079
certainly lots of entities that are less

1466
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,760
well able to defend themselves due to

1467
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,920
funding and tooling and whatnot

1468
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,680
those seem to be

1469
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,440
what's getting hit the most but i don't

1470
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,200
think it's intentional in terms of like

1471
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,720
yeah we really want these i think those

1472
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,839
are more function of opportunity

1473
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,720
great good answer there thanks um

1474
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,240
let's see if we got any more questions

1475
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,359
