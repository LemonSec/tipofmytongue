and this

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
term was actually told me you told me um

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
by uh

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,199

at united where i work um but i i loved

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,080
how

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,439
how it sounded

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
said um so i really wanted to um

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
incorporate that because it incorporates

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,320
what i've been learning over my career

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
so let me see if i can move to the next

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,280
slide

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
and a little bit about me um so father

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,120
husband those are the most important

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
things to me um the dollar sign next to

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
the cert actually looks

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,079
and

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
affects that pretty significantly

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
um the red team director cyber and intel

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,800
director

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,280
um been doing ccdc for a number of years

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
i i so i have quite a bit of experience

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
when it comes to all kinds of um

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,000
cyber related things and one of the

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,439
things that that i have

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,880
noticed over the years this is you know

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,119
um from job to job i've done a little

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,439
bit of job uh hopping and you'll see in

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
this um but um i've noticed that we all

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
talk about basics we all talk about hey

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
why aren't you doing you know

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
the the you know the simple stuff

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,360
and i've seen too many talks exactly

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,479
this style

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,119
um that is all about

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,520
you know have better passwords do this

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
do that

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
and

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,680
a lot of them don't tell you how to get

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
there

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
a lot of them you know

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,799
they say things that are super simple

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
when they're not they don't really give

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
the background for them so

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
um i've heard complaints like all of

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
that is well and good but it'll never

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
work where i work or

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
um

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
it's not as easy as you are making it

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
sound or we already know all this

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
and to those to those things i want to

59
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,200
say that um

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
this

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
is a journey through my career and my

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
experiences and i hope that you you see

63
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,200
that

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,440
um as i go through the different jobs

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,520
that i've had as i've gone as i go

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
through the different uh positions that

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
i've filled

68
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
um

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
unfortunately it's like a resume but

70
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
like i hope that you learn a little bit

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,879
from it

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,400
and

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
so here's my lesson uh lessons learned

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,319
the hard way that's as a as a marine um

75
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,640
that tends to be how i learn things as

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,200
as hard as possible like the worst way

77
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
possible so like i said i was in the

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
marine corps participated in the mars

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
cert so this is the first job that i

80
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,120
kind of had in cyber security

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,760
i learned a ton um

82
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
but one of the

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
things that stuck out one of the key

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
things that stuck out every single time

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
i had a conversation

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,599
when it came to anything cyber security

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,959
related

88
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
was the same thing that i really found

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
at the senate and same thing that i

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
found at the pentagon

91
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
and

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,200
it's any government work i think um

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,280
you'll you'll get the same thing

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
well this is legacy if we take it down

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
it's not going to work um

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
we don't have the people here anymore to

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
do the legacy we don't um

98
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
or to manage the legacy device or

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
whatever like that is one of the

100
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
permeating excuses because the

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,159
government had one of the first networks

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,840
in the world right so

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
it has all of that

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
legacy stuff so how do you deal with

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
that

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,280
well

107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
it's by changing

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
the the conversation

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,440
and

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,159
i think that legacy systems do their job

111
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
they do it well but it's

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,959
it's because we have these

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
outdated mindsets on them

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
um that really

115
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
stagnates and they're and it's like i

116
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
can't move this system to a windows 10

117
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
machine are because it only works on xp

118
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
or windows 2000 or windows nt

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
and that's because the people moving it

120
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,280
the person or other individuals moving

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,519
it think that the only way to move this

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
machine to a newer os or to modernize it

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
is to move it

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,000
by

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,839
figuring out how the installer works or

126
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,320
figuring out how the pieces work

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
then making sure that those pieces work

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
in windows 10 um

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,600
or when or a newer version of linux or

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
whatever

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
and

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
so the the problem isn't the legacy

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
device it's the fact that we don't have

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,600
the people thinking that this is the way

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
they can move it and and i i fall victim

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,840
to this all the time but this is one of

137
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
the things that i learned really um

138
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
early on in my career in

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
military and and the government is that

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
we think of things in the sense of how

141
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
we learned them and that that point in

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
time information on how we can move

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
things i know plenty of people who

144
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,039
who

145
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
still think that

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,880
ghost norton ghost is the only way to

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
clone a machine whereas we have like

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
uh

149
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
virtualization software out the wazoo

150
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
like you can get virtualization software

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
it comes installed on os's everywhere

152
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
right so like

153
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
um

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,479
we have to we have to battle the the

155
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
legacy issue not at the system level but

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
at the mindset level and find

157
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
and teach people better ways of doing

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
things and and staying up with those

159
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,960
things is really hard and so um training

160
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,680
and teaching and and

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
pushing people outside of their comfort

162
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
zone and norton ghost is a comfort zone

163
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
for many um

164
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
some of you don't even know what that is

165
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,759
i'm googling frantically on what that is

166
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
right now but um uh that's a comfort

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,720
zone for people so we need to push

168
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
people to go outside their comfort zone

169
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
to learn new technologies dev sec ops

170
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
devops all of this new stuff not

171
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
is devops even new anymore

172
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,319
um

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,600
yeah so

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
so pushing everyone outside their

175
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
boundaries and going forward and

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
thinking of way new ways to deal with

177
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,120
the legacy stuff because you can

178
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
essentially clone a system push it up

179
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
into aws and it'll work for the most

180
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,759
part right so you can have a windows nt

181
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,479
machine sitting there in nato s and

182
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,919
essentially have it modernized by

183
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,280
putting firewalls and all kinds of

184
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
things around it

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
um so gotta figure out how to things i

186
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
don't like lift and shift but we can get

187
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
to that at another time

188
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
so then i worked at applied security um

189
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
where i learned one of the most

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
frustrating but awesome things um

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,080
is

192
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
that the frustrating part is that at

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,639
the small little company um so big u.s

194
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
government small little company um

195
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,759
we had it so that no one actually had

196
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,120
admin privileges and this was back in

197
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,360
2009-ish like

198
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,000
there wasn't a lot of least privileged

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
talk out there

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,039
um but

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560
back in back in 2009 um this company had

202
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
it so that no one really had

203
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,919
admin privileges you had to check out uh

204
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
just like if you wanted to check out a

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
book from a library

206
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
that was a temporary

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,479
administrative privilege and it was

208
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,759
logged on what you were going to do with

209
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,319
it and how you're going to use it and

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,120
it

211
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
gets me every time that i work in an

212
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
organization where there's you know 15

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
domain admins or named domain admins or

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
are

215
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
named administrators for

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
global admin or aws administration or

217
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
azure as administration

218
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,720
that

219
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
why aren't these generic accounts why

220
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
um

221
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,639
why don't we manage who has access to

222
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,319
them and when they have access to them

223
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
and yeah it could you know it's it's

224
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
difficult to set up in and you know

225
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
admins are going to complain about it

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
because that's not how they are used to

227
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
doing things but that's really really

228
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,520
important

229
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,479
because

230
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,560
that permission that even if it's

231
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
automatic

232
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
netflix actually does this or did this

233
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,280
at least

234
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
back in

235
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
20 i think it was 12 they posted a

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
really good blog post about how every

237
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
time someone checks out an

238
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
administrative uh credential temporarily

239
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
um it goes into a slack channel for them

240
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
and everyone gets the update kind of

241
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
thing in a single channel and then um it

242
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,919
goes to also them and they can approve

243
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,440
disapprove it's like a side mfa thing

244
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
it was really amazing

245
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
and so um

246
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,640
more generic accounts more more logging

247
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,039
on those usage is really where we should

248
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
be going and and this beautiful basic

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,120
again 2009 right um this is when that

250
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
was happening

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
and so

252
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
we need to move towards that and and

253
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,399
this is not a you know instant overnight

254
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,120
thing you gotta go slowly with it but if

255
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
you're not already to the point where

256
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
um

257
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
you have a you're using something like

258
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,760
uh

259
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,240
shoot vault i forget who makes it

260
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
hashicorp um if you're not using

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
hashicorp vault or something where

262
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
you're vaulting the service accounts and

263
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,519
stuff like that that's something you

264
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
should already have on your um

265
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,519
your timeline

266
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
no matter what size company you are

267
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
right if you have any administrative

268
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,000
rights for anything even if you're

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
mom and pop you should have a way to

270
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
have a credential even if it's in a

271
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,519
password manager that you both share

272
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
where it's only

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
only used as a last resort it's not an

274
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
everyday use

275
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
administrative rights should not be

276
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,399
everyday carries is my new say

277
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,760
um

278
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
so rapid seven this is my first

279
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,080
consulting gig

280
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
this is when i started

281
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
having pen doing pen testing for lots of

282
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
different companies

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
and one of the interesting things about

284
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
pen testing a lot of different companies

285
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
is that you notice how you actually get

286
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,720
caught and how you don't

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
and so

288
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,640
uh over time over the year and some

289
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
changes that i worked there i did a pen

290
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
test a week so that's 52 weeks worth of

291
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
pen testing different companies and and

292
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
i noticed a trend like every time that i

293
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
would

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
um actually get caught by an

295
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,160
organization it was because a person not

296
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
security related would say hey my oracle

297
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
box has a new user on it why um i'm i'm

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
reporting this to security or

299
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,240
um i got a phishing email i'm reporting

300
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
this to security or

301
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,399
or me as the attacker i hit a honey

302
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,880
token and the honey token is essentially

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,040
a fake user or fake

304
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
file that creates a detection when it's

305
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
accessed or used

306
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
and so

307
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,480
i was detected so many times by by these

308
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,160
system administrators not even security

309
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
people system administrators

310
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
that would do um

311
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
small things to to get me detected and

312
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
um there's a small little ad at the

313
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,640
bottom saying things canaries are

314
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
awesome and they really are um i'm not

315
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
paid by them or anything but like it's

316
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
really an amazing tool um they have an

317
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
open source version too you can spin up

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,519
even if you're a small mom and pop shop

319
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,480
which is

320
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
um awesome that they give back to a

321
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
community like that and so people and

322
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
honey invest in your people invest in

323
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
your honey tokens um that's where your

324
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,360
best detective measures come out of play

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
um i've like i said i've been detected

326
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
multi by

327
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
these honey tokens more times than

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,519
multi-million dollar edrs

329
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,600
so then i went from consulting all the

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
way up to

331
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,519
general electric which is giant big

332
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,639
honking company i think 1.6 some odd

333
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
million users on it

334
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,519
and this is where i learned the

335
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,279
really hard lesson

336
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,399
as a as a marine i learned that security

337
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,279
yeah

338
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,120
is everyone's job every marine is a

339
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,839
rifleman um that gets

340
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,720
bundled into every single day of your

341
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
life as a military member

342
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
um

343
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,839
if you stand watch versus or or go to

344
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,920
war or anything like ever everyone's has

345
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
your back and that's really important

346
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
for those scenarios but

347
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
one of the things that

348
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
i hear time and time again at every

349
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
conference that i go to

350
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,160
is that it's the users stupid users darn

351
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
users

352
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,959
and um

353
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,440
it's not their job

354
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
and one of the cool things i learned at

355
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
general electric was

356
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
that

357
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
we can make it not their job and as

358
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
security professionals it's on us to do

359
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
that it's on us to

360
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,000
configure the things correctly so that

361
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,760
even if they do click a link if they

362
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
download a thing

363
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,440
that it doesn't do anything

364
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,399
um and while enabling their job so

365
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,480
incentivizing and protecting

366
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
um

367
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
there should not be a single negative

368
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
thing when someone clicks a

369
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
phishing email and what i mean by that

370
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
and i say thing because as generic as i

371
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,040
need

372
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,360
there should not be any repercussions

373
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,800
for them clicking on it they shouldn't

374
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
have extra training or anything like

375
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,399
that they also

376
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240
um shouldn't have anything happen on

377
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
their machines click malware whatever so

378
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,920
what i mean by that on this on the um

379
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,320
repercussion side is if you incentivize

380
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,959
them if you say hey um

381
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
you get 10 points every time you report

382
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,639
a phishing email people are going to

383
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,399
report it more

384
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,480
and that you know comes with some false

385
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,040
positives but you want people to to know

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
that and do that it's not their job so

387
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,959
you pay them essentially in points um

388
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,120
and points can come out of nowhere

389
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
by making it um

390
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,880
fun for them um where they can get you

391
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,920
know if they get 2000 points or whatever

392
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
um they can get a five dollar gift card

393
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,680
from amazon or if they get

394
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,279
twenty thousand points they can get a

395
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
fifty dollar gift card from amazon

396
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,160
whatever

397
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
you make it incentivize for them and you

398
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
will have people

399
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
uh loving security at that point right

400
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,600
um so you incentivize it and and we need

401
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,320
to we need to hold ourselves accountable

402
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
for doing a better job

403
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,240
at

404
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
at security in general because we're

405
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,279
just to be honest like we're not doing a

406
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,199
great job

407
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,920
and we need to do better

408
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,560
so r5 industries is where i headed next

409
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
this is a small little startup

410
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,839
unfortunately it's no longer around but

411
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,079
i learned a very very valuable lesson

412
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,199
there too

413
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,320
um

414
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
is that when i was consulting um i found

415
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
that companies that did attack surface

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
reduction um and not really pen testing

417
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
pen testing is great

418
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,279
um

419
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
but you don't really get the follow

420
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
through with it and it's and

421
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
um those types of vulnerabilities that a

422
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
pen test will show up is

423
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
gonna come back again

424
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,519
and when you actually look at attack

425
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,760
surface reduction what that means is

426
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,880
essentially you look at a single

427
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
kind of category of things and you say

428
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,600
all right we're gonna we're gonna fix

429
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,079
x we're gonna fix our azure standpoint

430
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,839
we're gonna fix our aws standpoint we're

431
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,279
gonna fix our

432
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
cicd pipeline we're going to fix our

433
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
whatever and you make it an entire

434
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
project or program at your organization

435
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
and say hey i'm going to go fix this

436
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
it does wonders

437
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,759
it does more than patching it does more

438
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,560
than

439
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
um pen testing it does more than red

440
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
teaming

441
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
just focusing thing focusing down an

442
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,120
object until it gets well secured and

443
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
then you focus down another one

444
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
um and

445
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
i like to think that that's one of the

446
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,399
best things about being an internal red

447
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
teamer is that you get this opportunity

448
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
to do that because it takes more than

449
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,040
finding a ton of vulnerabilities in the

450
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
line to actually do anything it takes

451
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,560
more than

452
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
um

453
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
like

454
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
one-time interactions or five-time

455
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,800
interactions with a single point of

456
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,399
contact it takes

457
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,480
collaboration it takes programs it takes

458
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,040
projects to get and solve problems and

459
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,920
so

460
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,440
um when you do an attack service

461
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
reduction program you work with all of

462
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,600
the people who build those things that

463
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,399
you're attacking and reducing the risk

464
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
the actual risk to them

465
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,600
and so

466
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
um if you have an internal red team you

467
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,040
should have them be doing tax reduction

468
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,399
projects

469
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,360
and have and tell them hey you know

470
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
our

471
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
cicd pipeline is what we want to focus

472
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,959
on next and

473
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,040
tell them go tear it apart go figure it

474
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
out not tear it apart you don't want any

475
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,880
outages but still

476
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,360
like find all these problems with them

477
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,759
excuse me

478
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,400
all right then

479
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
um unfortunately like i said that

480
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,160
resulted in um that company not resulted

481
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,319
in that's a bad way of saying that

482
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,640
company unfortunately didn't quite make

483
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,880
it so um

484
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,199
uh i went on and had the awesome

485
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,599
opportunity to work at ibm's x-force red

486
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,679
when they were just starting to kind of

487
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,160
stand that back up

488
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,559
and the lesson i learned here

489
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,960
this was consulting yet again

490
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
and um

491
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
and i noticed that one of the things

492
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
that i would do is

493
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,400
i would

494
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
somehow grab credentials because this

495
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
was about the time when

496
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
fishing

497
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,960
using exploits wasn't really working

498
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,840
anymore the java jar and java applets

499
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
didn't work anymore

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
um

501
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
and so credential grabbing was starting

502
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,039
to become a thing and

503
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
i noticed that when i had grab

504
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
credentials i could

505
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
fly drive whatever up to the

506
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
up to the place where they had the

507
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,320
corporate offices especially i mean this

508
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
wasn't during covid but like especially

509
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
during code when no one's around

510
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,559
you can sit out

511
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,320
in a driveway in a parking lot

512
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,559
next to a building whatever

513
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,480
and access wireless super easy

514
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
and nobody's talking about this

515
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
i know that the hack five pineapple does

516
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,600
a bunch of enterprise stuff i know that

517
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,799
um uh sensepost has an amazing track

518
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,440
record of uh i think they're a new

519
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,600
company now not since posted anymore but

520
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
they have an amazing track record of

521
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,360
doing all kinds of amazing attacks on

522
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,400
enterprise level things but

523
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
i don't think it's talked about enough

524
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,960
that if i grab a set of credentials

525
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
or certificate

526
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
from a company i

527
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
i can then access them permanently um

528
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
and no one notices and no one can tr and

529
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
it's very hard for people to track down

530
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
wireless connections

531
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,480
um

532
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,720
and i could go months

533
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,520
with my own machine that isn't monitored

534
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
um at all

535
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,120
on a system so what i'm asking here is

536
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,000
hey

537
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
on those radius servers on those aruba

538
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,039
servers turn on mfa turn on the ability

539
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,000
to do a push notification um to a system

540
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
so that when you connect you have to you

541
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
have to say go ahead and connect because

542
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
um if i steal a credential

543
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,880
i'm not going to have their phone i'm

544
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,200
not going to have wherever their mfa is

545
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,559
going

546
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,960
so then i can't connect make it so that

547
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,760
i can't just use a single factor a

548
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
certificate or a username and password

549
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
some companies have both where it's a

550
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,679
certificate username and password and

551
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
those not are not really

552
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
um

553
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
well that's not really multi-factor

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
because i have a certificate that means

555
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
i had access to your corporate network

556
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
once

557
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
um and that's it i don't have to have it

558
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
for a very long time because all i have

559
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
to do is request assert or have a cert

560
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
or have exploited a single system with

561
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,159
assert and i'll just be honest very

562
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,840
little times where those usernames and

563
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,240
passwords match up with the certificate

564
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,720
um or are checked between the two

565
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
um

566
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,280
and you can just connect and

567
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
um during my consulting time i noticed

568
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
that

569
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,679
oh my gosh i don't even know how many

570
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,720
times

571
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,240
um but i would just drive over and the

572
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,039
the

573
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,720
customer or point of contact would be

574
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,520
like

575
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
why on earth are you at my office or um

576
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,960
how did how did you do that because you

577
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
have access to all of the things

578
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
and i fished them once i didn't use

579
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,400
their vpn

580
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,080
i didn't use all of the other things

581
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,039
that do

582
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,360
have mfa these days and if you don't use

583
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
mfa on vpn please do

584
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
um but that's enough for another story

585
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,159
um

586
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,960
but

587
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,320
uh i know that mfa on wi-fi isn't talked

588
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
about that much but it is an option and

589
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,080
finding that option isn't easy

590
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
just from experience on a lot of

591
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
different companies that i've worked

592
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
with trying to turn this on

593
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
but it can be turned on and it's not a

594
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
super um difficult thing because all you

595
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,480
do is at the beginning of the day have

596
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,760
your users push the button on on mfa

597
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,039
and then they're connected for the rest

598
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,480
of the day which is fine

599
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,039
um but that that's the minimum

600
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,120
that should be that should be wireless

601
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
these days

602
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,200
all right uber um so after consulting i

603
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
noticed and this will be a trend you'll

604
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,559
you'll see

605
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,840
is i

606
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,280
am not

607
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,039
a fan

608
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,200
of consulting but it seems to draw me

609
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
back every single time

610
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
at uber i was an internal red teamer

611
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,480
flash instant responder

612
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
and

613
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,200
my

614
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,159
first week i think there

615
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
uh i noticed something that was

616
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,360
pretty mon mind boggling and so when i

617
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,000
when i uh

618
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,559
when i first started using chrome

619
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
i noticed that they were doing these

620
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,320
rolling automatic updates essentially um

621
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
in the background and and firefox does

622
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
the same thing now ie does it or edge

623
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
does the same thing now

624
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,360
and but i noticed something even more

625
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
amazing at uber

626
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,480
is

627
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
that

628
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
the mindset

629
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,080
that chrome has on rolling updates where

630
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,240
you're constantly getting these updates

631
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
has a

632
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
i don't know if it's an intended effect

633
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
but

634
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
it's it's certainly effective on

635
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,360
something

636
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
and what i mean by that is that

637
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,919
vulnerabilities or exploits if you're

638
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
building an exploit for chrome

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
you have to have a very specific version

640
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
in mind you have to have

641
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,280
um

642
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,320
and that worked for ie2 when um for

643
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,039
internet explorer you you targeted

644
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,799
ie6 ie7 not individual small little

645
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,120
things in between but big version

646
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
numbers is what you could target and now

647
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
with chrome because it updates all the

648
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
time

649
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
because it does all this all the time

650
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,080
you are

651
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
no longer able to say

652
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
i can exploit chrome

653
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,919
99

654
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,640
all across the board not easily like

655
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,960
in rare cases but it's such a rarity

656
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
these days um

657
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,240
that it dawned on me on previous jobs

658
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,039
that

659
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,559
the reason why

660
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,360
vulnerabilities aren't as as well seen

661
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,679
in browsers anymore is because of these

662
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
rolling updates and when i started

663
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
working at uber i noticed that they were

664
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,840
doing the same for

665
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
which

666
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
boggled my mind

667
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
and so i dug into it learned

668
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
that

669
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
they would have

670
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,720
individual server groups go down

671
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,279
do the patches all of the patches

672
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,279
while these other servers were load

673
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,480
balanced and

674
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
could handle the load and they would

675
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,159
spin up and down um

676
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,720
like and grow and shrink

677
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,559
uh using uh aws and and azure and all

678
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,799
the other gcp and stuff like that

679
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,279
automatically

680
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,159
but

681
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,679
um

682
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,360
but they were doing the same same for

683
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
servers

684
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,520
and

685
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
um

686
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,679
that had the same effect that chrome did

687
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,279
when they first started doing security

688
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,760
updates is that these systems were no

689
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,200
longer

690
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,279
they were no longer auto

691
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,760
you know or they no longer stayed online

692
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,799
forever and that offline that that

693
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
downtime actually

694
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,000
increased security by a lot

695
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,960
and

696
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,039
it also made me as an attacker when i

697
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
was doing red team stuff for them

698
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
i couldn't stay on a server for very

699
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,159
long because

700
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,480
it would stay alive for maybe an hour or

701
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
a day

702
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,159
um and i could do what i could but like

703
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
as certain as soon as that server went

704
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,440
offline got wiped and re re-loaded

705
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,600
um and this is where devops and

706
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
and

707
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
uh infrastructure's code and that kind

708
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
of stuff comes in

709
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
is that

710
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
uh i couldn't stay

711
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,320
on these systems for very long and that

712
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
was very new to me i i i love

713
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,520
persistence um

714
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,880
and

715
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,520
and figuring all that out was very tough

716
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,200
um

717
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,919
and so as an attacker it was really hard

718
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,120
to stay on any of the services that um

719
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
uber had because they were always

720
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,679
changing and there were microservices

721
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,840
all over the place and it was and they

722
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
were getting destroyed all the time

723
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,200
so

724
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,279
how does this how how can you work this

725
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
into a corporation how can you work this

726
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,600
into a bigger product well load

727
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,720
balancing resiliency um you build

728
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
servers where it's not just a single

729
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,960
monolithic giant server that does

730
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
everything you use microservices you use

731
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
docker containers

732
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
and blow them away

733
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,400
um

734
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,559
and then have them be rebuilt all the

735
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,520
time

736
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,200
that way you say ahead of patches that

737
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,640
way you stay

738
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,559
ahead of um

739
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,880
uh all kinds of things but obviously you

740
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
have to patch your core images and then

741
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
we're getting back to all of the you

742
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,520
know uh the problems we had with norton

743
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,240
ghost is where you know that image would

744
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,320
get out of date and then you'd deploy it

745
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,559
to a server and it'd take

746
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,960
five years to patch because

747
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,440
um your base image was out of date so

748
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
you update your base image auto goes to

749
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,799
the latest that's one of the coolest

750
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,640
things about docker is that if you're

751
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,840
pulling from latest it will

752
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,200
automatically do that and pull and go up

753
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
so

754
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
um

755
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
if you can change your mindset

756
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
of any server that you currently have be

757
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
it esxi

758
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
be it um

759
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,760
uh active directory even we'll talk

760
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,080
about that in a second but any identity

761
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,159
provider any other thing where you can

762
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,120
have

763
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,039
persistent data

764
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,159
with a non-persistent service um you

765
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,720
will go miles ahead of things

766
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
and that applies to everything that

767
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,080
really does

768
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
you see you see everything going to

769
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,559
kubernetes or docker and that's because

770
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,760
it can

771
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,159
um and it's and it's not as hard as you

772
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,960
think um

773
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,080
and

774
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,320
moving things that way and getting them

775
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,200
to and with that mindset in place

776
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
you will deal with security it will deal

777
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,600
with security without even thinking

778
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,918
about it

779
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
all right

780
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,559
uh this is probably one of the most the

781
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,360
the hardest to consume beautiful basic

782
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,399
lesson that i had um but it was amazing

783
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,520
and so

784
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
telling people about this getting them

785
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,440
to embrace it is

786
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
really hard because people like their

787
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,159
laptops

788
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,159
um and they use them for all kinds of

789
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,440
things but

790
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,559
uh

791
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,559
when i when again when i worked at uber

792
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,480
there was a um

793
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
there was a system that would continue

794
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,279
to be you know infected with random

795
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,320
malware

796
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,919
um and

797
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,200
every time it was because people were

798
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
plugging in usb sticks and it wasn't

799
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,679
it wasn't that they were plugging in usb

800
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,200
sticks that was the problem and that's

801
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,279
what everyone talks about is hey you

802
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
know you shouldn't allow usb sticks but

803
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
we need to change that thinking

804
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,159
and make it so that

805
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
they can still change it on a usb stick

806
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
and it doesn't do anything bad

807
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
um and this is what the whole talks

808
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,799
about right is finding ways to make it

809
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,399
so that

810
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,480
um the bad thing doesn't happen and the

811
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,080
good thing still does and um

812
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,200
so

813
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,360
we deployed a chromebook to that system

814
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,440
um to that location and uh instantly

815
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,840
overnight no more vulnerability no more

816
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
malware infections because

817
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,279
the malware on those usb sticks was

818
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,320
windows focused or mac focused right and

819
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,200
so

820
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,799
if it's a chromebook it doesn't have a

821
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,720
platform for that necessarily there's

822
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
there are chrome

823
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,720
book vulnerabilities but not as much and

824
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,640
as i said chrome changes all all the

825
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,799
time so

826
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,000
but if you

827
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,919
if you expand that if you take it to and

828
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,520
say hey

829
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,960
does my hr person really honestly need

830
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
need a full windows machine if they're

831
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,440
using office 365 or google sheets and

832
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,279
gusto and all of these other products

833
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,640
that are out there

834
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,399
that are all web-based

835
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,880
if if you if you have a person

836
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
in mind that doesn't

837
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,399
doesn't use anything but web-based

838
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,840
platforms

839
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
and that's where everything's going

840
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,320
these days

841
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080
then do they really need a windows

842
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
machine

843
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
um do they really need a back

844
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
and the answer is probably no but

845
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,960
tearing it out of their hands is going

846
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,120
to be tough and so what you need to do

847
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,000
to get this to work is and i found found

848
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,279
this to work

849
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,399
is you start with you know beta testers

850
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
people who will get an additional

851
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,919
chromebook

852
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,000
but not get it not get their main

853
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,960
machine

854
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
refreshed on them so they get the new

855
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
chromebook they start to like it because

856
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,559
it's portable and easy to use or

857
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,520
whatever

858
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,039
um

859
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
and are a lot a lot more portable than

860
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,919
the standard laptop um mean it's a lot

861
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,320
faster because there's no os to deal

862
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
with there's no

863
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
edr to deal with that kind of thing and

864
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,919
they start to like it and they start to

865
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,760
use it more and then they when you do

866
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,919
the refresh and they have to turn in

867
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
their old laptop it's been sitting in a

868
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,039
corner for

869
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,480
six months

870
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
and so

871
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,960
um

872
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
to get this to work to get it to you

873
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
don't force it down in anyone's throat

874
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,240
none of these lessons you force down you

875
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,919
went through it's it's a process to get

876
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,679
there and project to get there and and

877
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,600
that's why i think that internal red

878
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,039
teams are really good because they can

879
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,039
help these projects along and talk about

880
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,480
risk to them

881
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,440
um

882
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,320
and so

883
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,720
when we're

884
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,440
when you do something like this the it's

885
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
really hard for

886
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
um

887
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,720
ransomware or malware to get get in

888
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,440
touch with them and then by by making it

889
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
so individuals or smaller groups don't

890
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,919
have these types of os's anymore

891
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
it makes the attack surface in your

892
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,559
whole organization go lower

893
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,360
and

894
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,600
that does amazing things

895
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
um and it makes it really hard for me as

896
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,919
an attacker to

897
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,559
to laterally move to go anywhere else

898
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,720
if if i get on your one windows machine

899
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,279
you know now where to focus all your all

900
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,279
your efforts when it comes to edr

901
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,799
um it if i get on your one you know cert

902
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,159
windows server

903
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,760
that you haven't been able to migrate

904
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,640
into smaller clustered services or or

905
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
deployment services or rotating services

906
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,840
then you know where to focus right so

907
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,519
the more that you can reduce that attack

908
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
surface the better

909
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
and to do that

910
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,080
start by giving chromebooks or or other

911
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,760
similarly os minimalist minimalist

912
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
systems

913
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
i hope this is all making sense

914
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,240
because i can't see any feedback or

915
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,200
anything um

916
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
and so

917
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,919
when i when i moved on from uber i

918
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,320
worked at um cruise automation

919
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
um and

920
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,919
one of the things that i always knew

921
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,559
that firewalls good right everyone knows

922
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,919
firewall's good

923
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,880
um

924
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
but one of the cool things i learned at

925
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,919
sort of at uber but more firmly at cruz

926
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,480
was that

927
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,039
even their servers that weren't in ios

928
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,360
even their servers that weren't in

929
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,039
um

930
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,480
weren't in

931
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,159
uh

932
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
azure or gcp or

933
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,880
or containers

934
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,320
they had their firewalls fully turned on

935
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,080
and that was like and it was just

936
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,559
windows firewalls or ip tables they were

937
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,200
turned on in deny mode and unless they

938
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,440
specifically allowed that port it wasn't

939
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
going anywhere

940
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,640
and so what that did was me as an

941
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
attacker and i worked as a red teamer at

942
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,840
cruz

943
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,360
was

944
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,600
i couldn't find

945
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,360
windows you know

946
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,240
smp everywhere i had to really work it

947
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,600
like i could only talk to the domain

948
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,760
controller i had to really work at

949
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,080
finding those different parts so when

950
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,679
every server

951
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,880
only has

952
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
you know certain ports allowed maybe to

953
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,960
everyone but like just to ranges because

954
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,679
we had good you know network ranges

955
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,559
um

956
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,640
then i would have to get to another

957
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,399
server i'd have to find a vulnerability

958
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,399
in one of the servers in that same range

959
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,840
to be able to talk to the server i

960
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,440
wanted to talk to and that was

961
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
and that really goes back to one of the

962
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,039
previous lessons where

963
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,559
if you reduce

964
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
their uh the attack surface if you

965
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
reduce that if you push an attacker into

966
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,359
a corner i have to make more hops as an

967
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,480
attacker

968
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,639
to get somewhere and yes i might still

969
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,839
get there

970
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,000
no network is perfect

971
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
but

972
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,040
the more hops i have to do the easier it

973
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,079
is for that detection to happen

974
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,119
and so

975
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,199
um with this one though

976
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
firewalls uh one of the great things

977
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
about aws is that it starts with

978
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,199
firewall deny any on everything like uh

979
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
allowed in and you have to specifically

980
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,879
allow things in

981
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,760
and i love that mindset with a deny any

982
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,119
as default

983
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,560
because

984
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
uh

985
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,520
because you have to do a little work to

986
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
get it going but once it's going you're

987
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
good

988
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,399
and

989
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,839
that works

990
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,440
really well

991
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
but we need to start doing it on

992
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,079
internal servers and i mean if you have

993
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,680
if you have windows servers in your

994
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,400
network right now turn them all on

995
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,200
on

996
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,520
on on the firewall they're going to have

997
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,839
all the exclusions in there already

998
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,839
but you need to go in and remove those

999
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,040
exclusions

1000
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
and um

1001
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,560
it's a one by one yes or it might be

1002
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,359
group policy to to set those

1003
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,320
but

1004
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,240
it's it's a lot of work it's tedious

1005
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,640
work but it's amazing like

1006
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,720
it's super effective and if i

1007
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,240
if i saw any corporations do the

1008
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,800
the network of firewalling uh on like

1009
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,839
the built-in firewall on each system um

1010
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,079
you would be so close to zero trust with

1011
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,240
this like that is that is the key to

1012
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
zero trust is when when you can get

1013
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
every system in your network to have

1014
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,720
their

1015
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,280
host based firewall turned on not just

1016
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
on like in the workstation phase and

1017
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,480
this is what i'm going to talk about

1018
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,200
here

1019
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,599
is like

1020
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,720
windows firewall and domain mode isn't a

1021
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,400
firewall

1022
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,480
everything that you can imagine

1023
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,119
needing as an attacker is allowed

1024
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,960
on the domain mode

1025
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
and so

1026
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,920
what you need to do is put it into

1027
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,839
public mode even if it's connected to

1028
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,000
the domain every single workstation

1029
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,720
should be always in public mode

1030
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,800
and

1031
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,320
what i mean by that is that

1032
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,440
at this current point in time

1033
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
no one needs to rdp to a workstation

1034
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,040
like servers yeah sure um but first

1035
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,240
issues no

1036
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
um you should have some kind of remote

1037
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
administration on everything like an edr

1038
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,800
almost every edr i've ever looked at has

1039
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
a remote administration of some sort one

1040
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
one form or fashion

1041
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,160
um

1042
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,599
every single i.t support staff thing has

1043
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,400
a

1044
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
way to

1045
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
access the machine

1046
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
because it has an agent on the machine i

1047
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,200
mean every every system on a modern

1048
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,599
corporate network at any level has at

1049
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,920
least two to three or fifteen agents on

1050
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,119
it that you can figure out a way to

1051
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,800
remotely administer

1052
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
there should be zero reasons why

1053
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
anything should be coming in

1054
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,920
to a workstation on a corporate network

1055
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,280
and

1056
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
that's what public mode does and if you

1057
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,160
turn on public mode for every network um

1058
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,640
that does an amazing thing also for when

1059
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,880
they go home when they're remotely

1060
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,640
working when they are

1061
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,359
anywhere at a coffee shop or whatever so

1062
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,839
it was that mode was designed for coffee

1063
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,240
shops and hotel wi-fi but it it does

1064
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,640
just as good at home it does just as

1065
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,280
good in the corporate office

1066
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,599
it even does more because

1067
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,079
if a system in the corporate office is

1068
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,960
owned

1069
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,280
then

1070
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,880
then they can get to the workstations

1071
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,079
and that's where all the users are

1072
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,040
logged in

1073
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,880
he is an attacker i want to get to where

1074
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,480
all the users are logged in so i can get

1075
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,320
more credentials so i can go more places

1076
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,160
so um unfortunately cruz did a but uh a

1077
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,200
big layoff and i was part of that um

1078
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
and then i was welcomed with with the

1079
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,040
wide arms and the black hills

1080
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,560
information security of the family there

1081
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,839
is amazing

1082
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,720
um

1083
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,839
they are

1084
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,079
an awesome group of people i'm i was so

1085
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,720
happy to work with them um

1086
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,480
and what i learned there through

1087
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
consulting is that there were a couple

1088
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,520
companies

1089
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
um

1090
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,680
that

1091
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,560
were on the move or already there was

1092
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,400
one company that was already there

1093
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,839
but um

1094
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,079
very close to

1095
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,240
dropping active directory completely now

1096
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
active directories is monolith and we're

1097
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
getting away from that in as an industry

1098
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
we're getting away from these monolithic

1099
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,640
servers that do all of everything for us

1100
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,320
we're getting into microservices we're

1101
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,920
getting into the small bits that we can

1102
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,680
actually control way better

1103
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,079
and because active directory is so

1104
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,280
giant

1105
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,079
so

1106
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,280
i'm

1107
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,400
massive

1108
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,480
no one can ever think of

1109
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,680
we're gonna we're gonna get rid of

1110
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,480
active directory in five years

1111
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,440
because that undertaking just seems like

1112
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,599
an impossibility like no way not

1113
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,880
possible

1114
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,079
and i'm here to tell you it is um

1115
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,320
it's it's a slow process um and you

1116
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,119
start with you know moving users off of

1117
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,960
active directory or groups off of active

1118
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,440
directory um and one of the

1119
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,119
and this is actually a previous company

1120
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,000
that i saw where all of the groups

1121
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,800
for all permission and stuff like that

1122
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,160
they were still pointed at active

1123
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,520
directory at the time

1124
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,119
but they were all managed through a

1125
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,079
another

1126
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,400
software and i think it was built

1127
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,720
in-house but still

1128
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
all of the group membership everything

1129
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,560
where me as a manager or me as a

1130
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
director i had you know the ability to

1131
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,119
add or move people from my my groups

1132
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,880
very easily through this interface and i

1133
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,640
have a whole list of them all at once

1134
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,000
whereas with active directory i'd have

1135
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,800
to know

1136
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
all of the groups i own and then find a

1137
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,280
way to look at each one

1138
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
it's just

1139
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
too complex

1140
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,599
to be good for corporations these days

1141
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,640
um

1142
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,680
and so

1143
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,520
how you deal with this is by moving it

1144
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,440
slowly you you take one group move it

1145
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
off you take another group move it off

1146
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,400
you get an idp that syncs up with active

1147
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,960
directory and you slowly move everything

1148
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,720
to look at that idp

1149
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,640
and eventually

1150
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,079
active directory is no longer needed

1151
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,920
other than for ldap and then you cut the

1152
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
ldap tie

1153
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,000
it's a slow process

1154
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
um

1155
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
i'm not going to say it's not but it's

1156
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
not impossible

1157
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,880
and the great thing about so how do i

1158
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
manage my systems then how do i how do i

1159
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,119
do sccm how do i push things to my

1160
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,560
systems and that's all through mdm

1161
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
windows 11 windows 10 they all support

1162
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,040
mobile device management i don't even

1163
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
think it's called mobile device

1164
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,920
management anymore but mdm

1165
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,400
managing uh osx managing

1166
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,760
macs

1167
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,040
are way easier through mdm managing

1168
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
corporate phones all of that it's so

1169
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,960
much easier through mdm

1170
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,599
and um and it has a very specific

1171
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,160
purpose versus the active directory we

1172
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,520
can do everything

1173
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,280
and i hate to say it but like that's

1174
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,440
kind of what we need to need to be doing

1175
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,319
um

1176
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,920
it might take five years it might take

1177
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,079
two years it might take ten years

1178
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,040
but

1179
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
we need to get rid of all of the

1180
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,960
monolithic servers that do everything

1181
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,200
for a corporation and start moving to a

1182
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,760
place where we can rapidly change and

1183
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,640
and do that um

1184
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,960
quickly

1185
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,040
so um

1186
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,319
united airlines is where i work

1187
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,000
currently um

1188
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,720
and one of the um lessons not

1189
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,319
necessarily like i'm still learning

1190
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,319
lessons here but like this is not one

1191
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,160
specifically that i learned here but

1192
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,079
multiple different companies on the way

1193
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,319
back

1194
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,280
but one that most security people are

1195
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,400
not going to want to hear is that

1196
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,079
if you don't know if your tools are

1197
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,920
functioning they aren't

1198
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,000
um i want to know just in comments um

1199
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,560
uh on twitter or otherwise

1200
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,160
how many systems you actually have

1201
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,920
checking into your edr and does that

1202
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,800
fluctuate fluctuate um on a on a day to

1203
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,680
day

1204
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,760
how do you know which ones is there any

1205
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,560
alerting that one isn't checking in

1206
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,040
anymore or hasn't for a while

1207
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,920
um

1208
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,079
is there any way that you know

1209
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,560
that those systems are actually working

1210
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
and one of the uh

1211
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,960
one of the the questions that scares

1212
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,119
every single splunk engineer on the

1213
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,359
planet is would you know if logs stop

1214
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,560
coming in from one server

1215
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,359
i guarantee the answer is no

1216
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,119
this is

1217
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,040
this is what we need to start doing with

1218
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
our security tools right um

1219
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,920
uh originally one of the things one of

1220
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,160
the beautiful basics that i talked about

1221
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,119
uh or talk about frequently is

1222
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,760
mfa on security tools which is

1223
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
thankfully not a thing anymore uh well

1224
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,040
it is a thing and that's why i don't

1225
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,560
talk about it because

1226
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,160
almost every security tools that i

1227
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,319
talked to originally used to have

1228
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,560
default credentials

1229
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,520
ng

1230
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
way worse than the other things that

1231
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,839
we're scanning like

1232
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,640
like

1233
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,400
what was it

1234
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,760
one of the vulnerability management

1235
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,599
tools they had a default username

1236
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,359
password

1237
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,680
and so i could just log into that

1238
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,280
default username and password on a

1239
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,200
couple systems that i was doing

1240
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,560
um

1241
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,720
that i was doing these uh assessments

1242
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,599
for

1243
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,480
and then i know where the

1244
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,359
vulnerabilities are so i find mso8267 oh

1245
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,359
it's on that system okay done

1246
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,440
and we didn't really secure our tools

1247
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
now we're getting way better at securing

1248
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,359
our tools as security professionals and

1249
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,599
security engineers um but we're not

1250
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,560
doing a very good job at logging them

1251
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,880
so if if the swunk

1252
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,680
or

1253
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,960
or sumo server goes down

1254
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,440
how do you like you'll know that the

1255
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,599
sumo server is down but if the services

1256
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,839
are up but the things that are feeding

1257
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,839
it are no longer up

1258
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,839
you don't really know and that's one of

1259
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,119
the

1260
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,319
that's one of the harder things that

1261
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,520
we're getting to

1262
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,200
is finding when those happen and there

1263
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
was an organization i worked at

1264
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,920
um

1265
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,200
previously

1266
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,119
where we had um

1267
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,560
i think a

1268
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,800
uh an edr on

1269
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,160
i think it was something like ten

1270
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,200
thousand servers ten thousand systems

1271
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,599
and um there was a patch that came

1272
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,560
through

1273
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,760
that

1274
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,960
um the the update on these edr systems

1275
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,319
they patched

1276
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,040
all of them and 5 000 of them were no

1277
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,119
longer checking it because the patch

1278
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,960
didn't work

1279
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,040
5 000 of them

1280
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,119
out of 10 000

1281
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,880
and no one knew

1282
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,440
because there was no system in that

1283
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,400
system

1284
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,920
to say

1285
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,880
this is how or how many are checking in

1286
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,520
or this is you know we saw a large

1287
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,400
deficit in people or number of check-ins

1288
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
nothing is correlating that data with

1289
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
firewall logs or seeing if those systems

1290
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,839
are actually online but no longer

1291
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,400
checking in the edr

1292
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,680
and 5 000 systems were blind and

1293
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,480
we just happened as a pen test team to

1294
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,520
come in and hit those

1295
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,680
those specific systems without knowing

1296
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,040
that they didn't work

1297
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,119
um because it was a 50 50 chance at that

1298
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,599
point um and we hit those systems and

1299
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,200
they were and we're we're actually doing

1300
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,960
a purple team and we're like hey do you

1301
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,640
see this hey do you see this hey they're

1302
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,280
like no we don't which is really weird

1303
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,119
and

1304
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,440
um pipeline monitoring and what i mean

1305
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,640
by pipeline is is the pipeline of of

1306
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,480
endpoint to logging to detection to

1307
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,240
whatever else automation that you have

1308
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,400
all of that pipeline

1309
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,200
we do a pretty crap job at monitoring

1310
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,960
making sure those work

1311
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,280
and so we can we really need to get to a

1312
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
point where we're doing those things and

1313
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,599
and we will and how to do that is is

1314
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,079
involving i.t

1315
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,280
i.t

1316
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,040
are really good at doing their job at

1317
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,880
monitoring things going up and down they

1318
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,000
really are

1319
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that is one of their main focuses when

1320
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
it comes to server administration is

1321
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,880
uptime and they have tons of tools to do

1322
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,440
that a myriad of tools to do that

1323
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,720
involve them

1324
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
say hey

1325
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,079
i need to integrate my edr with this

1326
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,079
monitoring tool to make sure that if

1327
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,160
this system is offline

1328
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,800
via these seven checks

1329
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,480
or is online view of these seven checks

1330
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,640
but offline because of the an edr is not

1331
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,319
saying it

1332
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,760
say something

1333
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,079
because then you instantly know when an

1334
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,200
attacker

1335
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,839
is or even a malicious insider is trying

1336
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,040
to be more

1337
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,599
invisible

1338
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,920
all right and i think we're getting

1339
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,040
close to my time but if not i'm already

1340
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,560
done so i can answer a bunch of

1341
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,880
questions if there are any um thank you

1342
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,920
so much for um having me out i hope that

1343
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,000
this keynote at least learned something

1344
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
out of it um but if not

1345
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,839
i apologize

1346
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,520
uh you can always hit me up on twitter

1347
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,000
um i have my direct messages open there

1348
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,520
if you want to talk to me here in the

1349
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,920
comments too i'm open to that um but

1350
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,280
thank you so much for your time thank

1351
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,040
you for listening to me and i appreciate

1352
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,640
besides vancouver for having me out

1353
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,200
all right let's see if there's any

1354
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,759
questions in here

1355
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,779
[Music]

1356
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,839
my org has 080 that's awesome

1357
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,079
how easy are chromebooks to centrally

1358
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,680
manage from a config and update

1359
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,400
perspective super easy they just like

1360
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,440
any android device they connect to mdm

1361
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,040
very easily so if you already have an

1362
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,440
mdm for phones

1363
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,839
um these would just check into that and

1364
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,759
super easy thanks for the question tyler

1365
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,160
yeah docker latest is awesome

1366
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,400
norton ghost takes me back yup some

1367
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,440
people actually remember it

1368
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,960
uh

1369
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,280
so there's so bruce says responsibility

1370
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,640
equals if you see something say

1371
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,760
something

1372
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,240
um i agree with that when it especially

1373
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,040
when it comes to safety

1374
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,680
and safety is security sometimes

1375
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,160
many times

1376
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,040
but

1377
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,760
i think it stops there and we and we we

1378
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,160
as a as security professionals try to

1379
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,359
make it more

1380
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,119
um through security awareness training

1381
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,440
through other things but like um we try

1382
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,720
and push the fact that um it's more of

1383
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,040
their fault for not patching for not you

1384
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,280
know learning of the security awareness

1385
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,480
stuff or not

1386
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,359
um whatever and we push too much on them

1387
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,559
from jack have you seen any really good

1388
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,480
solutions for confirming that logs are

1389
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,960
arriving and sim properly

1390
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,880
um

1391
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
yeah uh so

1392
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,319
it's more

1393
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,720
it's more the uh

1394
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,559
arriving in this improperly that's

1395
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,240
that's an engineering thing initially

1396
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
when you first get it it's more the

1397
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,040
outages um that are the problem and

1398
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,119
um when a system is offline or a service

1399
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,520
is offline to push those

1400
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,559
those logs that's when it's not that

1401
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,160
they're not arriving correctly it's that

1402
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,680
they're arriving at all

1403
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,800
and so

1404
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,880
stuff like uh

1405
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,599
datadog monit um

1406
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,480
oh man there's uh

1407
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,319
a bunch of different secure

1408
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,040
it monitoring systems that can create

1409
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,839
checks to see if services are online

1410
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,480
if um if data's flowing

1411
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,160
all kinds of network

1412
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,079
configuration stuff that can work really

1413
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,000
well to do that and we just have to

1414
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
apply it to our security tools just like

1415
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,079
the servers and it

1416
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,079
apply to their applications and services

1417
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,359
um can you go without a d if you're

1418
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,640
going down azure path absolutely um

1419
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,280
you'll have azure id possibly for their

1420
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,160
identity provider um but they they also

1421
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,000
pretty sure they also have an additional

1422
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,079
identity provider it could be wrong

1423
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,000
there but i think they have another path

1424
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,119
if you're not doing the ad route

1425
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,480
but

1426
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,880
aad or azure ad is decent

1427
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,079
you don't have to use all of the

1428
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,160
features of ad and there's a lot of

1429
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,559
protections that come with azure id with

1430
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,640
the automation rotation and all of that

1431
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,319
when it

1432
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,400
being a cloud platform

1433
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,079
when it comes to log monitoring do you

1434
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,280
look at it

1435
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,960
at a transport layer or do you look at

1436
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,520
it at a landing zone both seem ideal but

1437
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,720
what's the biggest impact um i look at

1438
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,520
it

1439
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,119
more on

1440
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,040
not on like i said not on the landing

1441
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,680
zone not on the transport layer but more

1442
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
on the system that would be providing

1443
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,280
those services

1444
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,240
so

1445
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,200
um

1446
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,079
so if i have server a and server a is

1447
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,240
going to splunk for instance

1448
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,839
um i'm monitoring the service on so i'll

1449
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,000
have a like a splunk group

1450
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,599
and then inside that group i'll be

1451
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,760
monitoring splunk itself

1452
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,200
but i also have a plugin or a piece

1453
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,880
going to server a

1454
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,240
that says

1455
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,200
this service on server a like

1456
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,200
file beat whatever

1457
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,359
win log b

1458
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,520
i want to make sure that it goes it is

1459
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,680
always online and if it goes offline

1460
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,240
there's a red dot in our splunk server

1461
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,598
and that way it can monitor in both

1462
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,640
all right

1463
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,319
i think that's everything that i saw

1464
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,359
thanks again for your time appreciate it

1465
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,839
have a nice day i i don't know how to

1466
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,520
log out of here

1467
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,200
thanks a lot rob there's a couple other

1468
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,040
questions here that popped up in the uh

1469
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,720
in the chat that we didn't get to if you

1470
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,640
have the time um yeah

1471
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,319
but one of the questions here was do you

1472
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,720
have any recommendations for wi-fi mfa

1473
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,440
they're using uh octa id as their ivp

1474
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,119
but they seem to be only compatible with

1475
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,520
cisco

1476
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,680
so

1477
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,280
that's a that's an interesting question

1478
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,200
a little deeper than okay so they have

1479
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,359
octa they have um cisco cisco does have

1480
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,359
um features and capabilities to turn on

1481
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,599
mfa on their radius services

1482
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,400
um but it's non-standard and so you got

1483
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,160
to get their engineering team involved

1484
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,720
in enabling that on your systems and if

1485
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,400
you have all the older systems it's not

1486
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,040
going to be there unfortunately so um

1487
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,640
it's a newer thing that's starting to

1488
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,960
roll out um on the cisco side aruba i

1489
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,319
think has it our

1490
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,800
hat does definitely have it already

1491
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,040
a few other wireless

1492
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,000
aps and and services already have it but

1493
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,680
i don't think

1494
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,559
cisco has it as a default yet or is an

1495
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,359
available option by default yet

1496
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,079
and just one last one here is uh are

1497
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,599
there any recommended ways to configure

1498
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,079
command-based privilege escalation on

1499
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,319
windows systems with a non-login account

1500
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,599
similar to sudoers on linux

1501
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,520
this is nothing to do with my

1502
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,839
my talk but

1503
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,400
um pick it up

1504
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,880
there's absolutely um if you want to

1505
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,400
send me a direct message i will answer

1506
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,800
that um uh there's tons of ways to do it

1507
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,680
um

1508
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,880
a great blog to go look at though is

1509
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,839
hexcorn's um

1510
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,559
um uh

1511
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,280
uh after the run key or past the run key

1512
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,599
i'm forgetting the name of it um but

1513
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,400
hexacorn's um blog series he has like

1514
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,280
170 things on persistence on windows
