here today

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,280
i'm doing a talk on online privacy and

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,960
risk management

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,279
and let me just pull press play here

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,439
oh let's

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,359

introduce myself so my name is ritu gill

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
i'm an open source intelligence analyst

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,160
with 14 years with the canadian

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
government specifically with law

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,600
enforcement 12 of those years i was with

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,120
the royal canadian mounted police

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
canada's national police force

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,079
i am a ocean enthusiast

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,920
you can find me online on twitter where

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,719
i go by the handle oset techniques um

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,200
i'm also an advisory member of osync

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,239
curious

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,239
which is a group of some

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,120
you know amazing ocean people uh i work

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,320
with many other um great ocean people uh

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
teaching those um

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
who want to learn about open source

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,360
intelligence uh we post blogs

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
10 minute tips and other content um for

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
those that want to advance their ocean

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,159
skills

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,240
i also have a website uh ocean

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,759
techniques and i started writing courses

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
for verified investigators on cyber

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
training

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
so what are we going to talk about today

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
the agenda today is to talk about some

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,040
basics like definitions of ocean opsec

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
threat modeling might heard some of

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
these terms before i will go over

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
examples of how people compromise

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
themselves online and then i'm going to

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
discuss ways that say you can stay

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
secure and i'm going to share some

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,240
resources that could also help with

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
discovering your online footprint and

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,200
then

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
find ways that you can remove some of

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,159
this information

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,200
so open source intelligence

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
it's a process of collecting evaluating

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,639
and analyzing publicly available

52
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,080
information with the goal of answering a

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
specific intelligence question so this

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
is my full-time job and

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,640
how it fits in with privacy you might

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
wonder well if people did a better job

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
of managing their online footprint it

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
would make my heart my job a lot harder

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,000
it would make it really difficult

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
and so let's talk about opsec what is

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,599
opsec it stands for operational security

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,040
and the objective of opsec is to prevent

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,840
sensitive data uh falling into the wrong

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
hands okay so we first want to identify

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
that data that can be compromised and

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,480
then we want to take the steps to reduce

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,200
the exploitation of that data

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,560
so think about it like this a bad actor

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
could use information you're sharing

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
online and do something nefarious

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
like break into your house while you're

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,920
on vacation because maybe you shared uh

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
photos with your family saying that hey

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
you're all away from the house so it's

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,000
empty

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,879
so

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,680
some questions to think about

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,640
and let's start here is

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
what can an adversary or a bad actor

80
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
gain from looking at your online

81
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,159
footprint

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,799
where do you expose yourself too much

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
online

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
how can you minimize those risks

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
these questions will help make your

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
assessment

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
for you having better opsec might

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
might mean preventing

89
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,959
somebody with bad intentions um from

90
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,040
identifying you online or knowing where

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
you live or work sometimes you don't

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
want that information known

93
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
but there are some of you that need to

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
take it like another step further and

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
you need more protection because of the

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,480
type of work you do okay

97
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,519
so a threat model i talked about some of

98
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,280
these basic terminology some of these

99
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
terms a threat model is a method of

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
evaluating security and privacy risks in

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
order

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
to mitigate them that's the point

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
everyone's threat model will look

104
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,880
different

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
and there are different levels of threat

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
models okay so some may only need to do

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,759
basics like password protect devices use

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
use strong passwords use two-factor

109
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,400
authentication where some of you might

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
need to take it a step further and

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,639
actively remove

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,120
some of that public data from the

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
internet

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
so you might be thinking well okay

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,880
um

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
how do i figure this out well to figure

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
out what your threat model is

118
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,479
you want to find the answers to

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,000
questions such as

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,560
what information do you want to protect

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,440
so

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
your house address your work location

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
family members your assets these are

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
things we typically want to protect

125
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,479
what are you doing now

126
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,400
um online

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
or what are you doing now that exposes

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
you online you have privacy settings on

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
all your social media what do you post

130
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
online

131
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
and then who might want to gain access

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
to this information

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
this can be in the form of people you

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,840
don't know who are looking for a soft

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
for example this can be in the form of

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
say you apply to a job and a recruiter

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
searches for your name on social media

138
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,479
to see what you post

139
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
to get an idea about your character

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
right it could be simple as that

141
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,280
somebody wanting to get information

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,039
about you

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,360
so from there you would conduct an

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
assessment like this it's a good

145
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,479
reminder of how your online activity can

146
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,600
impact you

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
you may move into a job where you need

148
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
to reassess your threat model that's why

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
it's important to think about this often

150
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,039
and reassess as necessary

151
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,039
and one thing i always like to point out

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,240
here is

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
risk factors

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
definitely you are a risk factor and

155
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,039
what you do online but also family

156
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,199
members friends colleagues they can

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
inadvertently expose you online some

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,479
every some of you might be thinking well

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
what are you talking about okay well i'm

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,479
a ocean analyst as i've mentioned

161
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,280
and i search and find information about

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
people all the time

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
there's an incredible amount of

164
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,479
information

165
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
people post online that gets used um and

166
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
to give you an idea

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
of what i need to start with well here's

168
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
a list

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,520
so these are the things you want to

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
protect okay um all these things allow

171
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
me to find out more about you so whether

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
it's your name or

173
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,599
a username your email addresses

174
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,919
employment information i call these

175
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
digital breadcrumbs

176
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
and they help build a pro they help

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
build a profile on a person or a

178
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,560
business or whatever it is um at the end

179
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
of the day the more private someone is

180
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,759
the harder it is to ocean okay the

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,680
harder it is to find that publicly

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,599
available information

183
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
so remember these are things you want to

184
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,280
protect

185
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
and yes some people make it really easy

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
so this post caught my eye this person

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,919
made it so easy to find information

188
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,039
about him

189
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,919
uh

190
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,280
on facebook

191
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
posted his current workplace his job his

192
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,360
past uh job where he lived um where he

193
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
was from he had even had a he tagged um

194
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
something on facebook that said his name

195
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
so let's just say his name was john and

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
it said john's house and it had a

197
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
location

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
uh and so that was probably his house

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,240
address which was really not great to

200
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
post

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
furthermore he had

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
notes posted where he had tagged his

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
mom his girlfriend

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
in general just too much information

205
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,120
um and of course this post caught my eye

206
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
because you know he evaded police and i

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
was like oh interesting

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,639
but at the end of the day

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,400
no privacy settings right

210
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,919
uh the reason i'm showing you these

211
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,440
examples are

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
they're takeaways for us people like us

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
right we can learn from other people's

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
mistakes

215
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,800
and then

216
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
you see ones like this

217
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
it's a facebook group somebody finds a

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,479
driver's license

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,520
and

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,640
they post it and i've purposely blacked

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
out a lot of blurred out the images and

222
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
stuff so i don't further expose that

223
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,279
person but

224
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,240
this is not a good idea uh that's por

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
offsec as written on that slide that's

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,160
what i i wrote there i drew that on

227
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,680
there um

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
it's just that wasn't necessary to post

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
somebody's driver's license on uh open

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,680
facebook group not not great right too

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,000
much personal information but again

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
people aren't always thinking about

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
these things

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,040
let's look at an example of um something

235
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
i just call leaky documents where some

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
people might not realize their google

237
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,839
drive

238
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
is not always secure so using

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
a google search here and a site operator

240
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,200
that's what i've done in this example

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
you can look for resumes on google

242
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
drives these types of documents are

243
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,720
sensitive as they contain so much

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
personal information

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,640
it can include your home address right

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
phone numbers emails employment

247
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
information um and more

248
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,720
so this is a good reminder to

249
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
ensure your settings are secure on the

250
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
platforms you use not just google drive

251
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,040
but in general but ensure your google

252
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,839
drive is locked down um but always check

253
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
your privacy settings

254
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,000
i posted a link on the slide

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,519
for those of you that want to learn more

256
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,920
about search operators

257
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
how to narrow down your search when

258
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
you're using uh search engines because

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
that's a

260
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,839
that's a really helpful

261
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,360
skill set to have

262
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,720
to find the results you're looking for

263
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
all right this one so from the ocean

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,519
mindset

265
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,600
barcodes can provide us with important

266
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
information some people don't realize

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,399
that barcodes contain personal data or

268
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,560
they can right for example people on

269
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,040
social media love posting their boarding

270
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,000
passes

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,959
okay

272
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,519
um so in this example

273
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,640
number one

274
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
i was looking at someone's instagram

275
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
post from

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
post of their boarding pass

277
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,680
uh which they posted with a hashtag

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,959
boardingpass

279
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,760
so

280
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,320
that's a thing some of these hashtags

281
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,200
they just um they're again

282
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,839
great for finding information but really

283
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,040
poor optic

284
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
um there this person was using an alias

285
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,279
on their instagram account so i didn't

286
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
really know their real name i was like

287
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
okay and it wasn't actually a name um

288
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,720
it was uh just some sort of some sort of

289
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
username um not related to the person i

290
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,240
guess

291
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,040
um

292
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
and when they posted their boarding pass

293
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,640
they covered their name with their thumb

294
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
which is shown in

295
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
uh

296
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
in the image too obviously i've had to

297
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,519
crop it out and all that kind of stuff

298
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,399
um they obviously didn't realize that

299
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,519
there are online barcode readers where

300
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
you know people can use which is say

301
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,240
number three that screenshot um that

302
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
will

303
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440
scan a barcode and tell you if there's

304
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,480
any data in there and so i did because

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
you know i'm an osin and a privacy

306
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
person and i'm always curious what

307
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
people are doing online

308
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
i took the barcode entered it into the

309
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,079
barcode reader and in image four is the

310
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,800
result so it revealed this person's

311
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
first name their last name

312
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
the departing airport

313
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
the destination airport what airline it

314
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
was flight number

315
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
um

316
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
sometimes it will even give you like

317
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,720
their frequent flyer points uh their

318
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
number or whatever access um you might

319
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,920
think so what well hackers are known to

320
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
look for this information and they can

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,639
hijack accounts moreover they can gain

322
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,240
more personal information about that

323
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
person so this is just a small example

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,279
to show you that even barcodes can

325
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,800
expose you

326
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,079
in different ways online

327
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,800
here's an example of how people

328
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
inadvertently leak information about

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
themselves so social engineering

330
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
questions

331
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
you've probably seen them on social

332
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,240
media

333
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,360
uh

334
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
these questions people keep answering

335
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
they're a prime example of over sharing

336
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,279
sensitive data online

337
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
and sometimes some of the questions are

338
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
not too big of a deal but then there's

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
questions

340
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
and you'll see on the right screenshot

341
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
here uh where people provide too much

342
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
information so where someone somebody

343
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
could use these answers to guess

344
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
security questions so like hey what are

345
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
your siblings names what's your favorite

346
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,639
song um

347
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,560
it can go on and on right so not all

348
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,519
these would uh maybe um fall into you

349
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
know trying to access somebody's account

350
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,839
but there are several right sometimes

351
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,200
what's your favorite color what's your

352
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
favorite band important important dates

353
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,279
um even you know uh to do

354
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,120
with schedules or when that person is

355
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
this is just poor privacy when you're

356
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
you know answering these questions and

357
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
then people will repost them and then

358
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
other people will answer

359
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
so most people know not to post pictures

360
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,360
or credit cards or pictures of their

361
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
credit cards or disclose sensitive

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
information online but a surprising

363
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
number of people will post their phone

364
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
numbers and home addresses on social

365
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
media it's shocking i see it all the

366
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
time

367
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,279
so again you might ask what's the risk

368
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,399
well somebody guessing passwords uh

369
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,480
social engineering attacks against you

370
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
maybe physical harm etc

371
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
so the takeaway on the slide is pretty

372
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
much what you see on the left screenshot

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
stop giving people your personal info to

374
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
guess your password and security

375
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,880
questions bad idea don't do it

376
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
so you're probably thinking wow okay it

377
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,639
doesn't stop so no it doesn't end there

378
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,040
there's more the past couple years have

379
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
been terrible for over sharing people

380
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,639
posting uh their vaccine cards

381
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,560
it can tell a lot about somebody and i

382
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
just use this one as an example

383
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
regardless of what kind of card it is

384
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
but this is kind of more i guess in a

385
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
recent

386
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
thing uh

387
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
depending on

388
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
what your vaccine cards say if you if

389
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
you are vaccinated what it says it could

390
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
include your date of birth it could tell

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
you about somebody in terms of what city

392
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,760
or what country where they're from um

393
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
your name and

394
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
depending again where you're from how

395
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,399
much there could be a lot of information

396
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,839
exposed

397
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,279
not only that

398
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,680
there was a huge issue with people doing

399
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
counterfeit and that kind of stuff but

400
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,440
you're making it really easy by posting

401
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
that card there to just grab a

402
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
screenshot and go from there the second

403
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
example

404
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
packages so

405
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
people again

406
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240
uh we love shopping we love our amazon

407
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
all that kind of stuff but a lot of

408
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,320
people get the boxes they throw them out

409
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
throw them in recycling or wherever they

410
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,639
put them um with their addresses their

411
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
names on these boxes

412
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,680
again

413
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
i mean

414
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
people are dumpster driving whatever

415
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,079
people might be looking for hey i need

416
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
an address and a name well just go in

417
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
the recycling bin if you're if you live

418
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
in one of those buildings uh

419
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,839
one of the shared buildings that kind of

420
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,720
thing third example

421
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
in this third example a male was seen

422
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
wearing his work uh

423
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,279
badge when he stormed the capitol uh

424
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
last january

425
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,959
so again and i i believe from the news

426
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
article he was fired but again why would

427
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
you do that

428
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
why would you do either

429
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
and then we have um things like i just

430
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
call it sketchy text messages you'll you

431
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
likely have experienced those phishing

432
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
text messages

433
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
uh where they want you to click on a

434
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
link in this example

435
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
i received a text message where there

436
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,040
was an ip address noted and a mention of

437
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,839
a netflix account so when i searched

438
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,360
that ip in urlscan.io

439
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
it was tagged as malicious

440
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
activity so there was a huge red flag

441
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
right there

442
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
not that i would have clicked on it but

443
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,519
i just wanted to know what it said um

444
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,440
also i don't have a netflix account in

445
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,279
my name so i knew that was a phishing

446
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
text on top of it so the takeaway first

447
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,680
thing don't click on unknown links or

448
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,399
addresses via text or email

449
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,320
a good website to check for malicious

450
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
content including searching for websites

451
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,839
or ips

452
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,399
uh is

453
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,920
urlscan.io the one i showed in this

454
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,399
screenshot

455
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,440
okay so i know this example um it's not

456
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,199
about online privacy but i felt it was

457
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
still important enough as a reminder

458
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
because a lot of people will post about

459
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,480
these same things on social media posts

460
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
so not only

461
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,120
that

462
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,240
uh

463
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,839
but what you have to remember that what

464
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,079
you put on your say vehicles they can

465
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,839
impact your physical

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
physical security as well so car

467
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
stickers can give away a lot of personal

468
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,000
information so whether you're driving

469
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,599
through town or your car's parked at

470
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,039
your residence think about what you're

471
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,000
advertising okay so about your kids what

472
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,559
activities they're involved in

473
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,559
expensive toys say you have in your

474
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,000
garage um if you have a pet their name

475
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
where you live work where your kids go

476
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
to school that kind of stuff again

477
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
anybody can easily become a target for

478
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,679
different reasons but these are things

479
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
to think about and i'm not trying to get

480
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
people to be paranoid but i think it's

481
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
important to

482
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,400
care about your privacy

483
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
so

484
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
be mindful of

485
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
what's in the back of

486
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
your photos you know whether you're on a

487
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
video conference call that way you just

488
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,679
have more control of what you expose

489
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,679
okay so these are some tips just when

490
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,960
you're sharing content what you want to

491
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,000
think about

492
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
privacy settings don't always work on

493
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
all platforms

494
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
facebook for example is leaky privacy

495
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,919
settings on facebook are not black and

496
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,160
white okay and i'm telling you that from

497
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,559
experience years of experience uh using

498
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,679
facebook um for investigations

499
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,320
before posting you want to ask yourself

500
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,559
if what you posted was leaked would it

501
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
compromise say your location if it

502
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,039
mattered uh your family

503
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
and then proceed with your actions

504
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,799
before i post anything on social media

505
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,799
privacy settings or not i ask myself

506
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
this question and then i proceed i

507
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,600
consider all my social media

508
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,520
interactions as public

509
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,600
even if i have a private social media

510
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
account um

511
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,120
i always think of it as uh

512
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
you know if it gets out in the public is

513
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,960
this going to be an issue for me um

514
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
also i consider and you should consider

515
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
what you post as permanent because

516
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
whether you're using snapchat instagram

517
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,240
whatever platform you like people take

518
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
screenshots so even though something

519
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
might disappear after

520
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
whatever seconds or you know after so

521
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
many days or or whatnot

522
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
there still could be a

523
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,039
record of it

524
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,760
it's easy to overshare online and

525
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
overlook the risks um but a question

526
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
think about is what might a fraudster do

527
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
with this information

528
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
and the last thing i want to say is

529
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
remember that everything that you're

530
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
posting online is building your digital

531
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
footprint that's really important to

532
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
remember

533
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
sorry uh so some basic tips so what can

534
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
you do to protect yourself

535
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,799
um

536
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,200
these are some general tips that you can

537
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
start with for better online privacy and

538
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,600
security

539
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,400
you can use strong passwords

540
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
you know using strong passwords that

541
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
passwords manager is a start

542
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
but also think about your browsing

543
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
habits and

544
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
you know using maybe a secure search

545
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,960
engine like doc.go or

546
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,679
startpage.com

547
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,200
that don't save and collect your

548
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
personal information

549
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,320
um and the next few slides are about

550
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,159
your searching habits so

551
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,640
to get a complete list um you can scan

552
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
this qr code i know that sounds super

553
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,600
sketchy for a privacy talk um but

554
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
don't randomly scan qr codes because

555
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
they can contain like on the street i

556
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
wouldn't just go around scanning these

557
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
codes because they can contain malicious

558
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,039
content this one

559
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
is just a link to my website because i

560
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,720
didn't want to put all the tips on the

561
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,600
side they didn't fit um it just links to

562
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
osentechnics.com

563
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,520
um and that's all that is

564
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
other things you want to think about

565
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
though is you know don't leave your

566
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
devices unintended when you you know go

567
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,919
to a coffee shop do you just walk away

568
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,880
um you know do you lock your screen

569
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
when you walk away do you use webcam

570
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,440
covers do you use a privacy filter

571
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
sometimes

572
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,559
it's important for some of those some of

573
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,760
us to care about that kind of stuff

574
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,919
so let's talk about search engines

575
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,000
like google chrome that save a lot of

576
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,840
information about us

577
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,000
and i one thing i do notice is there's a

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
lot of confusion about what incognito

579
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,679
mode is

580
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
um using incognito mode doesn't really

581
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,120
protect you it won't save information on

582
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,520
the computer that you're using but your

583
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
isp your internet service provider and

584
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
other websites can still see your

585
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,320
searches

586
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,200
so

587
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,559
for me it's

588
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,880
i'll use incognito when i'm using

589
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,960
somebody else's machine you know you're

590
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
over and you need to borrow somebody i

591
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,919
would be like okay i'm going to use

592
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,520
incognito that's when i would use it

593
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
this prevents your history and what you

594
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,520
search and the cookies from being saved

595
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,919
on that particular device that's all it

596
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,159
does

597
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,440
so what else um browser fingerprinting i

598
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
want to mention this it's a technique

599
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
used to identify people based on

600
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,159
their device settings your browser

601
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,960
always divulges some information to

602
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
websites you visit such as hey the

603
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,559
browser you using operating system the

604
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,120
exact version of say the browser

605
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,320
so whether you've left it um not updated

606
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
that kind of thing

607
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,159
if you want to see what your browser

608
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080
fingerprint looks like you can use one

609
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,919
or a couple of the following free

610
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,280
services

611
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,720
um

612
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,840
coveryourtracks.eff.org or say

613
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
am i unique.org

614
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,640
it you can find out say you know see

615
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
what they see the your ip the type of

616
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
browser that kind of see it's

617
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
interesting to see what you look like

618
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,159
when you look at websites especially if

619
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
you're looking at like personal websites

620
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,039
that somebody might be monitoring um

621
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,039
i look at it from the perspective of if

622
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,640
i'm investigating or researching

623
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,159
someone's website

624
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,799
i would like to cover up who i actually

625
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,320
am versus who i want them to think i am

626
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,640
um so some of these websites again they

627
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,320
give you the insight into how identify

628
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
identifiable you are

629
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
to sites and people um and sometimes

630
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
it's worth to do a comparison like i'll

631
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,080
pick a couple just to see what uh the

632
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
different sites say about you

633
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,799
um again after using some of these sites

634
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,840
you might say well what can i do to

635
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,760
maybe fix this or change this

636
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,679
okay this is an example from

637
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,679
miunique.org

638
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,400
so again

639
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
it'll help you understand what's

640
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,200
collected about you when you visit a

641
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,559
site

642
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,400
and you'll see the the higher the

643
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,919
similarity percentage um the better

644
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,960
for you because you blend in um so

645
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,799
that's kind of interesting but you can

646
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,159
give this a try

647
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
and see how it works for you um another

648
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
site that i don't think i have on this

649
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,279
slide or on the last slide was um is

650
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,080
device info.me

651
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,120
so device info.me that's another site

652
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,720
that also does something very similar

653
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,520
so some browser extensions that you can

654
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
use to adjust your privacy settings

655
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,799
there's many but i'll cover these three

656
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
quickly um there's https everywhere so

657
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,520
they this will encrypt your

658
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
communication with many major websites

659
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
so it'll make your browsing more secure

660
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,320
it will switch a site from being

661
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
insecure so the http

662
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,679
to secure so that's h t um

663
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,320
https the s being for secure privacy

664
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
badger it will block advertisers and

665
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,240
third-party trackers from

666
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,559
secretly tracking where you go and what

667
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
pages you visit so that's another good

668
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,039
one and then we have something different

669
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,039
user agent switcher

670
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,960
this extension changes the user agent

671
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,799
which is something that identifies what

672
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,760
browsers browser you're using so you can

673
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
you know and what version and what

674
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
operating system so

675
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,840
with this add-on it helps you change

676
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
your browser and your operating system

677
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,679
footprint

678
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,799
i could be

679
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,360
i could be using an ios device

680
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
on chrome but spoof these details with

681
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,880
this extension that's what it does

682
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
all right so let's see here

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,120
what else can you do to secure yourself

684
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,360
what are some solutions

685
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,159
simply security

686
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,640
by absence okay not posting the

687
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,559
information out there in the first place

688
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,559
you can't get hack through what you

689
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,640
don't have you know through the services

690
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
apps that you don't actually have this

691
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,960
is a good reminder that if you stop

692
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
using certain apps sites or whatever it

693
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,159
is

694
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
you want to make sure you delete them

695
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,240
don't just say hey i'm off and just

696
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
leave it there because that information

697
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,159
still can be used by people this is part

698
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,320
of cleaning up your digital footprint

699
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
i've conducted security assessments

700
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,520
where i often will find a user's old

701
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
accounts they never deleted but they're

702
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,520
like oh i stopped using it um but they

703
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,400
contain

704
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,840
a lot of

705
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,480
information such as photos

706
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,559
associations to people and all that kind

707
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,320
of stuff that's why

708
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,200
you want to care about that

709
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
disinformation there's another technique

710
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,679
it's called disinformation where you

711
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,679
plant some fake information to mix up

712
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,640
your digital footprint you can create

713
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
fake accounts especially if you do have

714
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
a unique name maybe

715
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
if you have a common name like mine it

716
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
is common people sometimes are confused

717
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
by that but it is common um

718
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
it helps me kind of hide in some ways

719
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
but if your aim isn't common you'll have

720
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,760
to put in more effort and disinformation

721
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,520
is one of those techniques

722
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,279
say for example you search your name and

723
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,360
you find information false information

724
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
about yourself out there

725
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
perhaps leave it there that's what i

726
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,120
would do right um i wouldn't try to

727
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,039
correct it maybe

728
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
the goal is to make attribution to your

729
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,240
name difficult

730
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,080
educating those people around you this

731
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
is really important letting people know

732
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
how they might be compromising their

733
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
privacy and security and why it matters

734
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,159
there's a cool little video here um

735
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,919
which shows it's called data to go and

736
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,159
some of you may have already seen it it

737
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,000
shows how easy it is to obtain

738
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,679
information about people online it's a

739
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
quick few minute video

740
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
um but again it's uh you can if you

741
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
don't feel comfortable with visiting the

742
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,960
tiny url i created i created that

743
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,760
you can just go into youtube and enter

744
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,279
data to go

745
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,279
and check it out

746
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,880
what else can you do there's so much you

747
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,960
can do data breaches they're constant

748
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
have you checked if your accounts have

749
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
been a part of a data breach troy hunt

750
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,279
has a website called have i been pwned

751
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,960
where you can search for emails and

752
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
phone numbers

753
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,679
to see if they're associated with

754
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,559
breaches so go run your own and see if

755
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,320
you were part of a breach

756
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,279
this

757
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,399
uh service all also allows you to sign

758
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,559
up for notifications so any future

759
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,880
breaches you'll be notified if you find

760
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
you've been in a breach make sure you go

761
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,159
change your password you might want to

762
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,159
even go delete the account altogether in

763
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,159
some situations it's all about

764
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,600
minimizing the data out there about us

765
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,279
some useful websites i'm not going to go

766
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,760
into details here as i'm getting close

767
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,000
to my time um but these are some

768
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
resources and i've explained what they

769
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,480
do

770
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,720
uh another one that's not on this is

771
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,480
called

772
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,799
privacytests.org it's a web browser uh

773
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,360
privacy it's a comparison essentially

774
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
but you can go through these different

775
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
sites allow you to do different things

776
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,520
they're just some resources for you

777
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,039
and there's an exercise you can do

778
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,640
number one tip is that majority of

779
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,720
awesome people start with ocean or a

780
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,799
search engine so

781
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
try searching your data on google and

782
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,200
bing and find ways you can remove this

783
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,600
information you know through the contact

784
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
information on a website if it's there

785
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
this is one of the easiest ways uh to

786
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,000
see what your digital format looks like

787
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,320
so start with what you use your name

788
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
your usernames your emails search your

789
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
home address and quotes use quotes

790
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,320
around your name um add a location so

791
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,880
you know uh whatever area you're from

792
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,399
and

793
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,960
also think of search engines as that low

794
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,320
hanging fruit

795
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,679
next

796
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,960
the next thing you want to think about

797
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,039
is those manual searches when you're

798
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,520
into social media go go see what those

799
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
look like as well

800
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,080
and again some more resources here um

801
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,679
if you do come across things there's a

802
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,159
couple of resources here uh i have

803
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,399
there's one from michael bazelle the

804
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,520
first one

805
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
um another one from mike micah hoffman

806
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,720
who's web breacher on twitter and joss

807
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,640
josh huff who's learn all the things on

808
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,720
twitter they provide a bunch of useful

809
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
tips to clean up your digital footprint

810
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
um i understand there will be challenges

811
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,480
depending on what country you're from

812
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
like the united states where they

813
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,559
don't um

814
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,320
they have a lot of public information

815
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,559
about their citizens so it's more of a

816
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,840
challenge but it's still possible

817
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,200
and for those of you that like

818
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,120
documentaries and that kind of stuff

819
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,240
this was or is available on netflix

820
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,080
the social dilemma is a good awareness

821
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
film and it shows the many ways social

822
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,399
media

823
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,000
platforms influence society um it's also

824
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
interesting that a lot of the former uh

825
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
a lot of the people they interviewed

826
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
were former employees of facebook google

827
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,559
and whatnot

828
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,919
all right

829
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,360
final thoughts

830
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
okay so remember threat actors can use

831
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
information to their advantage and we

832
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
need to do better to protect ourselves

833
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
don't be a soft target

834
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
by exposing too much personal

835
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
information or details about your life

836
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,399
online

837
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,799
and this last one here so here's a recap

838
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,200
of my presentation which i will post on

839
