1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,560
welcome uh stephen master welcome to

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,480
besides vancouver 2022 um track two

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,320
and day two

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,679
uh steven's gonna talk about raising the

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
bar of ics security um welcome steven

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
and um take it away

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,720
all right thanks very much welcome

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,160
everyone i know we're getting towards

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,880
the end of day two so hopefully uh

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,000
you've been enjoying lots of good

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
presentations and uh hopefully i can add

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,720
to that a little bit as well

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
we've been

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,519
talking i think more and more about

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
industrial control systems and ics

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,680
security and there's lots of stories

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
some of which all in the news some of

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
which i'll talk about

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,399
um but

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,480
i don't know how far we go with

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,760
practical

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,719
actionable advice out there

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
for folks who want to do better for

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,520
security and industrial control system

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
environments i know

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
uh in my experience

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,559
everyone acknowledges that it's a

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,160
problem and doesn't want to touch it

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,559
with a 10 foot pole because of

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,239
mysterious bad things that might happen

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,520
if we touch

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,559
those

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,080
systems that have been running untouched

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
for the last 40 years or so so i'm gonna

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,119
try and introduce the landscape a little

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
bit here and then talk about some of the

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
uh things that we can do to uh raise

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
that bar

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,360
yes once i get focused there we go

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
i think we can all agree that when we're

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
talking about uh ics security we're

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,920
talking about protecting the real world

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
right

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
um

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,479
i pulled a bunch of words from various

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,119
definitions of uh industrial control

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,600
systems uh these are the words that

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
popped out and uh on the left we've got

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,759
some of the definitions or at least

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,000
fragments of some of the definitions

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
around industrial control systems just

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
so we know what we're talking about here

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,159
that we're we're all on the same page

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,320
uh as i mentioned we're talking about

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
computers or devices or systems

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
cyber systems electronic systems

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
whatever you want to call them i already

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
said cyber there you go

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
that can influence the real world or

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,439
bridge the cyber world with the physical

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
world

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
another way to look at it is we have

63
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
systems or technology that can manage

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
command direct and regulate behavior

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,160
again kind of tying into the real world

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
very very often we are talking about

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
systems of systems we're not talking

68
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,680
about a single device in isolation we're

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
talking about systems that manage

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,520
systems of systems of systems it's it's

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
very much a tiered uh environment

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
uh other other definitions i've said is

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
the company or i've seen is the

74
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
combination of hardware and software and

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
network

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
to again influence the real world and of

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,319
course what are we trying to do here

78
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
this is the actual goal which is

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
automating an industrial process which

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,879
could be anything from you know water to

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,560
electricity to oil and gas to

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
manufacturing to uh

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
to pharmaceuticals to any number of

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
other uh sectors as well

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
in fact one of the first um

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,840
topics or sectors that comes to mind is

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
critical infrastructure right that is

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,879
really

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,280
our primary focus i would argue when we

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,879
talk about industrial control system

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,480
security because

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
we have industrial control systems in a

93
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,599
lot of sectors that are critical to our

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,879
daily life

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
the 16 that are on the screen uh right

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
now are

97
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,200
the 16 critical infrastructure sectors

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,440
as defined by the u.s government and

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,799
some of them might be a little bit

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
surprising right we see financial

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
services in here but again if we can't

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
access money

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
we might have some problems uh day to

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
day right we've got health care in here

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
we've got manufacturing as we've seen

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
with with a lot of supply chain issues

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,159
we've had over the last few years um you

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
know we can do without certain things uh

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
arriving on our doorstep the next day

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,640
but uh there's a lot of products

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,159
uh that are critical to our everyday

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
life that are that come out of that

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
manufacturing sector

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
and there's a whole bunch of other ones

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
here that you can see

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
um and and probably make a whole lot of

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,040
sense in the context of critical

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,319
infrastructure

119
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,519
the definition um from the us government

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,798
is sectors that are so vital that their

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
incapacitation or destruction would have

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,600
a debilitating effect on security

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
national economy or economic security

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,800
and national public health or safety so

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
if we have disruption in these sectors

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
it's going to have a real material

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
impact on our daily lives and not just

128
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,479
an individual's daily life but

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,680
everyone's um you know nationwide or or

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
in a in a geography

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
that means obviously we need to do

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
something to protect these

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
sectors

134
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
because every last one of them has

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
significant automation in some way shape

136
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,840
or form

137
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
and that's what we want to protect

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
so when we talk about a control system

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,919
this is the

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
forgive my my powerpoint artistry here

141
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
but this is a very basic model of what

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
we mean when we talk about a control

143
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
system we have a loop we have a process

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
it's doing something it could be

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
manufacturing it could be transmitting

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
electricity it could be anything

147
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
and we have a controller some piece of

148
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
technology

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
and that controller

150
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,639
is going to send output to what we call

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
actuators but that can be anything that

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,600
could be

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
switches or valves or or motors or

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
burners or anything that we can use to

155
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
interact this is our bridge to the real

156
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,840
world

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,600
um so a controller is going to send

158
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
commands or direct actuators which will

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
then have a change in the process

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
which we measure using sensors

161
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,880
providing input back to the controller

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
and ideally it works in a relatively

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
anonymous fashion in a loop here keeping

164
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
our process healthy doing whatever it's

165
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
supposed to be doing on a daily basis

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
or our daily basis minute by minute

167
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,479
second by second we have other pieces

168
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
here though we have engineers who help

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
design and implement we have operators

170
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
operating day-to-day technicians

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
maintaining and they may interact

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
directly with the controller with the

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
sensors with the actuators and make sure

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
things are operating as they are

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
supposed to

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,160
and we also have supervisory systems

177
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
that maybe those people might interact

178
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
with

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
or that might interact with that

180
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
controller or with many controllers

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
again systems of systems

182
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
and

183
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,039
try to coordinate multiple controllers

184
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
or provide that high level oversight in

185
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
terms of what's going on so when i talk

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
about a control system at its most basic

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
this is what i'm talking about we have

188
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
sensors that are watching or measuring a

189
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,199
process

190
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
and providing data and input to a

191
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,199
controller that then has a program and

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
allows it to determine what needs to

193
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
happen next

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
it's going to send commands or output to

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,840
those actuators which will then adjust

196
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,720
the process as necessary

197
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
so what can go wrong

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
what what is an attacker trying to do

199
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
here

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
well an attacker wants to get in a

201
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
position

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
where they can disrupt this process in

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
some way shape or form that can happen

204
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
lots of ways

205
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,919
if um

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,080
an attacker is sitting

207
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
we'll call it inline or on the network

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
or has an ability to act to interrupt

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,000
this communication

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
um that normally the the humans would be

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
having with the actuators well they can

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
change the actuators maybe they can

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
interact with the controller directly or

214
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
indirectly and that can change output

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
and maybe that can change the view of

216
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,479
input that is sent up to supervisory

217
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
systems to conceal an attack

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,120
or just uh adjust the sensors you know

219
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
the old uh

220
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,759
um

221
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,400
tv show with the the bank robbers or

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
whoever in the building and looping the

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
cameras right maybe maybe an attacker

224
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
can do that or they can reach right in

225
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
from this top

226
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,759
and affect multiple systems an attacker

227
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
wants to get in

228
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,919
get to one of these positions so that

229
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,000
they can have whatever impact they want

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
to have on the process

231
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
shut it down gain an economic advantage

232
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,039
blow something up whatever it is this is

233
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
what we're trying to prevent we're

234
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
trying to prevent attackers from getting

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,520
all the way to the point where they have

236
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
access to control

237
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,919
uh the actual controller control the

238
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,199
process control the sensors the

239
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
actuators and

240
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,199
and take an action that impacts that

241
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
real world that's what we're trying to

242
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
protect against which is what i want to

243
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,760
talk more about

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
ics attacks you know prior to 2010 there

245
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,880
probably wasn't a lot um

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,399
i'm sure there were things going on but

247
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,240
nothing at a

248
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
um at a scale like we see today nothing

249
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,680
that's that was truly remote and

250
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
automated and and widespread

251
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
as as i'm sure many of you know stuxnet

252
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,279
came onto the scene in 2010

253
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,040
um and on the slide i've bolded the

254
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
um

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
attacks or the incidents that had

256
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,000
either

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
did have or potential to have

258
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
a direct

259
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
impact in the real world some of these

260
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720
other attacks were um had

261
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
either um they were gathering

262
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
information or

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
they they weren't manipulating the

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,959
process directly but they certainly had

265
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
impacts to industrial organizations

266
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,640
um dooku and flame were more

267
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,120
uh intelligence gathering they collected

268
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,399
information that could be used for

269
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
future attacks but shimon took out some

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
30 000 odd endpoints uh in saudi arabia

271
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,360
but

272
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
not directly affecting the process they

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,800
took out

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
the vast majority of the systems within

275
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
the organization

276
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
dragonfly was a campaign havex was a

277
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
tool

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
it was again mostly just looking for

279
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
information but it had impact it was

280
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
able to overwhelm systems intentionally

281
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,240
or

282
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
or accidentally um this was was one of

283
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
the earlier supply chain attacks that we

284
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
saw as well it was embedded havex was

285
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
embedded in legitimate software that

286
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
people were downloading onto their ics

287
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,040
networks

288
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
german steel mail was just

289
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
run-of-the-mill

290
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
malware but

291
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,440
as as we think we know anyways the

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,279
operators ultimately decided to do

293
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
something about it and brought their own

294
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
mill down in the process

295
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
black energy there's multiple versions

296
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,079
but black energy too specifically

297
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,200
attacked

298
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
um

299
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,920
controllers

300
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,160
uh always the ge simplicity and uh some

301
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
siemens controllers or hmis as well

302
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
sorry not controllers hmis

303
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
in destroyer one

304
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
uh is now called in destroyer one

305
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
because we have destroyer two that was

306
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
the blackouts in ukraine in 2015 three

307
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
hours without power to some

308
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
two three hundred thousand people that

309
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
was

310
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
truly real world impacting a lot of

311
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
people malware uh and they came back um

312
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
the very next year and attempted uh

313
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
something similar that was less

314
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
successful but was still

315
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
uh directly impacting control systems

316
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,560
2017 back to saudi arabia attacking

317
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
safety systems our last line of defense

318
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
to make sure nothing bad happens well

319
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
they almost

320
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
came were taken offline enabling

321
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
significant attacks

322
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
and then i don't know there were no

323
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,959
major news worthy attacks i'm sure lots

324
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,920
happened between 2017 and 2021 where we

325
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,279
had oldsmar the water treatment um and

326
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
colonial pipeline attacks again

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,839
obviously major impact but not direct

328
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,079
manipulation of the real world and i'll

329
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
talk about in destroyer 2 and pipe dream

330
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,839
here

331
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,519
briefly on the next slide so we are

332
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,839
seeing more and more attacks that are

333
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,200
i don't want to use the word advanced

334
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
but they are more advanced

335
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,959
and they are having

336
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,279
they are more and more um targeted at

337
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,959
the real world at having those real

338
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,920
world impacts

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,720
the new new folks on the scene in

340
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
destroyer turn in destroyer 2 also from

341
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
sand worm who are behind several of

342
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
these attacks

343
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,360
it was used against a ukrainian energy

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,079
provider and it was talking iec 104

345
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,079
which is an industrial protocol

346
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
used to communicate with controllers in

347
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
primarily electric um in the electric

348
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,160
sector

349
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,519
and there were some additional pieces

350
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
like wipers that came along with it but

351
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,720
again

352
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,839
um

353
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,079
getting more and more sophisticated able

354
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,600
to actually talk

355
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
um

356
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
ics protocols there's some modularity it

357
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
could be used it wasn't set up that way

358
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
but can be used with other protocols as

359
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,160
well

360
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
and then we saw pipe dream which takes

361
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,920
this even further

362
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,720
was

363
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,399
discovered prior to deployment so it

364
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,800
hasn't been used against anybody that we

365
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
know of

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,200
but it was tailored to impact specific

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
uh controllers specific um servers and

368
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
opc ua is a protocol that is a

369
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
multi-vendor multi-environment it can be

370
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
used to impact um a whole bunch of

371
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,880
different environments and it had all

372
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
kinds of capabilities was deemed a swiss

373
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
army knife

374
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
the good news was it was discovered

375
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
before it could be deployed which

376
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
allowed us to get

377
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,240
indicators of compromise and and some

378
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
awareness out there to potentially

379
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
mitigate an attack

380
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,959
all of this goes just to say that we are

381
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,720
seeing significant attacks against ics

382
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,880
and we'll talk a little bit about what

383
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,839
that means to us in a

384
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,959
minute how are attackers going about

385
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,959
doing this i talked about a few slides

386
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
ago you know being able to influence

387
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,480
those sensors those actuators those

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
controllers and so on

389
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,959
but

390
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
it's not that simple

391
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
and and i think that's something we

392
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,639
sometimes lose sight of

393
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,800
there is um

394
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,360
sans put forth an ics kill chain this

395
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
was quite a few years ago now

396
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,079
uh obviously loosely based on the the

397
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,240
lockheed martin kill chain but ics

398
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
networks are different there's often

399
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
very very often two stages

400
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
the attacker has to get to the point

401
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
where they have access to an ics network

402
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
and that may happen many many ways

403
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,920
but often that is by coming in through

404
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
the internet or through fishing

405
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
etc into a corporate a business network

406
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
and escalating privileges moving around

407
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,040
the business network

408
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,760
um exploiting vulnerabilities installing

409
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
c2

410
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
and getting to the point where they can

411
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,880
commence an attack against likely the

412
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
ics boundary or the edge of the ics

413
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
network if there's some segmentation

414
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
there

415
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
and then get into the ics network and

416
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,440
learn about what's there at that point

417
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
uh i'll i'll get on to the the next

418
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,519
slide but you've got an initial point

419
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
where you just get to the ics network

420
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,360
there's a lot of work that just happens

421
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
at that level just to get there that's

422
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
what we call stage one of the ics kill

423
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,959
chain

424
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
it allows the attacker to get to the

425
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,199
point where they can uh perform

426
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,839
reconnaissance against the ics

427
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,639
environment now to develop the attack

428
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
against that

429
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
i just i'll i'll bring this up quite a

430
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
few times uh throughout this this talk

431
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,560
but

432
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,759
that it ot boundary in stage one the

433
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,519
attackers are gonna cross that boundary

434
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,320
into ot or just get right up and through

435
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,600
that boundary

436
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
often very often from the business

437
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
network sometimes directly from the

438
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
internet although we hope not but remote

439
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
access and business to business partner

440
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,320
connections vendor connections those are

441
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
a huge source of access for for

442
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
malicious actors

443
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
that that's how they're going to

444
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,120
initially get across that boundary into

445
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,880
ot and that's going to speak to some of

446
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
the things we want to do to protect

447
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
against them in the future

448
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,839
now what this means is attackers tend to

449
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,720
land on familiar systems on windows

450
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,639
systems because that's what we tend to

451
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
have at the boundary

452
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
uh and attackers like this because

453
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
they're familiar they're well understood

454
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
we have a ton of windows attacker

455
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
tradecraft out there

456
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
and the attackers they don't need a deep

457
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
understanding of process control if they

458
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,959
can just click buttons on a windows

459
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,279
system right in destroyer the first one

460
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,320
in 2015 ultimately the attackers were

461
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
controlling a window system with remote

462
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
desktop assistance no less and pushing

463
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,720
buttons to shut things down like

464
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
clicking things on the screen that

465
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,759
didn't require any sophisticated

466
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
knowledge of control systems really i

467
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
mean understanding that you're on a

468
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
system that can open breakers and cause

469
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
an outage sure but that was it so this

470
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
is this is going to start to inform our

471
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,480
defense at least the initial layers of

472
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,399
our defense

473
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
so an attacker lands probably on this

474
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,360
windows system at the itot boundary

475
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
what's next

476
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
well now

477
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,079
they're going to perform reconnaissance

478
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,559
in the ics network

479
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,079
so they're going to want to maintain

480
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
access to the extent they've got it but

481
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,319
now figure out what's there on that ics

482
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
network and develop a target specific

483
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,640
attack if you do you spend any time in

484
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,679
ics you'll know that yeah we do a lot of

485
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
the same sorts of things from

486
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
organization to organization and yes

487
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
there are common vendors and common

488
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
tools but every single environment is

489
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
different

490
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,600
so an attacker has to develop some

491
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,960
target specific knowledge and capability

492
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,559
and they probably are going to want to

493
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,559
build that in a lab and test it offline

494
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,160
and validate i mean we're going for real

495
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
world impacts here you don't just want

496
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
to you know

497
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
throw a hail mary and hope it works

498
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,720
once it's tested and validated then they

499
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
have to deliver that payload to the ics

500
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
network maybe over the existing command

501
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,720
and control through the existing

502
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
foothold but that payload has to get

503
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
there and then be executed and then if

504
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
everything lines up then the bad thing

505
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
happens so this means something else for

506
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,919
us

507
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,760
if we can stop that attack

508
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
anytime

509
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
before this point basically before the

510
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
delivery even the delivery maybe we

511
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,679
could argue is is okay but before the

512
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
installation and execution of the attack

513
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,080
we're actually winning so we need to

514
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
keep that in mind from at least a

515
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
starting point on the defensive side

516
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,840
right we want to stop them anywhere in

517
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
this this range obviously as soon as we

518
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
can or as early as we can but we've got

519
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,039
a lot of opportunities here to detect

520
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,080
and stop attackers and and that's what

521
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
we need to be thinking about we win if

522
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,160
we stop them before that line

523
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,400
and remember again most attacks i told

524
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,919
you i keep saying it originate on the

525
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
business network or the internet yes

526
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
physical access usb bunch of other risks

527
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
yes but

528
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
vast majority come through that business

529
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
network

530
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,679
this helps us inform what we want to do

531
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,520
for defense

532
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,039
before we get to defense though let's

533
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
talk about our risks what are we trying

534
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
to prevent well we kind of talked about

535
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,360
it we don't want stuff to blow up

536
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
but we have our standard business risks

537
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,799
and these still apply

538
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,559
we don't want to lose access to business

539
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,120
applications that make the business work

540
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
we don't want ransomware data corruption

541
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,039
loss that kind of thing and we

542
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
definitely don't want brand or

543
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
reputational impact those are things

544
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,679
that can happen whether we're talking

545
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,400
about an ics attack or not

546
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
but in an ics world we have much more

547
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,679
critical

548
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
certainly impactful things that can

549
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,160
happen as well if we lose visibility or

550
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
control the process again bad things

551
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
could happen things can

552
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
um

553
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,200
explode leak burn whatever whatever it

554
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
is

555
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,919
obviously a manipulation of the physical

556
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,440
process could cause those same things to

557
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
happen could cause

558
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,080
uh

559
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,679
risk to to people to environment to both

560
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,120
and of course

561
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
if we're talking about ics

562
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
unless we're talking about kind of

563
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,159
government operated or um you know like

564
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,640
i think water treatment for example it's

565
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
not a profit center for for a

566
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,159
municipality for example

567
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,480
it but it is absolutely critical but

568
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,440
most

569
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,880
in in the corporate world most

570
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,039
industrial control systems they are the

571
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
lifeblood of the company they're the

572
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,440
economic engine of that company and

573
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,600
therefore any loss of production or

574
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,159
operations can have massive financial

575
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,640
impacts as well to the point where a

576
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
company can easily go out of business so

577
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
these are risks these are big stakes

578
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
that we're trying to

579
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
mitigate or protect against

580
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
what are common exposures i've touched

581
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
on a lot of these

582
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
that business to ics connectivity that

583
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
itot boundary right there that is one of

584
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
our biggest risks our biggest areas of

585
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
exposure as i've been saying but remote

586
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
access and vendors the nature of these

587
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
systems is they're old we might not have

588
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
people who understand how they work

589
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,120
anymore they could be decades old

590
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,799
they're very specialized in a lot of

591
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,520
cases vendors don't always like to share

592
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
information about them so there's a ton

593
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,280
of remote access we want to be able to

594
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
operate them 24 7 so just for that

595
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
reason a ton of remote access

596
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,120
connections to vendors as we know bad

597
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
things can come across those connections

598
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,360
that's a huge exposure as well

599
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
internet connectivity whether authorized

600
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
or unauthorized we want to minimize it

601
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,679
obviously but

602
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,760
sometimes it if there's unauthorized

603
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,919
internet that's a huge exposure

604
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
and once an attacker has access a lack

605
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
of segmentation an inability to contain

606
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,760
any sort of

607
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,000
[Music]

608
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
pivoting or movement through the network

609
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
by an attacker

610
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,520
and of course if we don't know that

611
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
something bad is happening well that's

612
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
bad in and of itself right insufficient

613
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
monitoring

614
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,600
we don't tend to have it or cyber

615
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,880
security monitoring in ot networks to

616
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
the extent we do in it networks anyways

617
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,280
we might monitor the process but not

618
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840
necessarily the technology around it

619
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
these are the risks we're trying to

620
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
mitigate

621
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
so let's raise the bar a little bit

622
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,360
that's that's why we're here right

623
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,840
let's start with the sliding scale of

624
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,799
cyber security

625
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,280
this there are a lot of things that we

626
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
can do

627
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
to protect ourselves

628
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
and we start on the left here with

629
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,039
architecture right now

630
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,039
you're going to tell me well we've got

631
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,720
an environment that's been operating for

632
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,200
40 50 60 years who knows how long maybe

633
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
not that long but some of them are

634
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
it's we're a little past architecture

635
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
yeah maybe you are but that's still

636
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
something we need to

637
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,039
um that's that is still where we need to

638
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,200
start it's just we can't rip everything

639
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
out and start over all at once it we

640
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
have to work our way backwards

641
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,840
obviously architecture

642
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
is fundamental if we architect our

643
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
environments appropriately it makes all

644
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,440
the rest of the security much much more

645
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
straightforward to implement

646
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
passive defense is where we are at uh

647
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,159
this is where

648
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,799
you know pro um stereotypical cyber

649
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,640
security looks like right

650
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,320
this is systems added to the

651
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
architecture to provide reliable defense

652
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,200
or insight against threats without

653
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
consistent human interaction humans

654
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,640
might set it up

655
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,039
but we're not going to be there you know

656
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,200
interacting on an ongoing basis

657
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
at the passive defense level this is all

658
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
of the tools you can go the toys you can

659
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
go to market and buy right

660
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
start with firewalls just as an example

661
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,960
right any of those toys you can buy

662
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,080
plug in and magic happens hopefully but

663
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159
no really even if you know usually we're

664
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,559
talking about humans configuring them

665
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,760
um that's our passive defense we buy a

666
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,919
firewall we put it in place we segment

667
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,039
the network that's part of our

668
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,400
architecture

669
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
and we put firewall policy in place to

670
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
control access

671
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
and as long as we don't screw it up that

672
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,679
defense is there the firewall's there

673
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,360
and it's continuing to provide that

674
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,200
defense without human interaction

675
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
as we mature we get to active defense

676
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
which is the real people part where

677
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,919
people are monitoring responding and

678
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,440
learning from the adversaries it's more

679
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
of a dynamic

680
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,159
you know um

681
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
situation where where we can actually

682
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
detect and observe and see what's going

683
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
on and react to that and it doesn't just

684
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,039
stop at the detection it's going back

685
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,000
and

686
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
um interacting with the environment to

687
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,400
make it more resilient to get rid of the

688
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,640
attacker to get them out to section them

689
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,000
off and so on

690
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
and as we mature we can also augment

691
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
that capability with intelligence that

692
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
is ideally specific to us or our

693
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,159
industry

694
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,760
and then offense not hacking back but

695
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
legal countermeasures self-defense

696
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,039
actions that could be involving law

697
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
enforcement that could be

698
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
doing something for attribution to

699
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
figure out where the attacker is so that

700
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
you can do something in the real world

701
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,880
or

702
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
it's these are the the counter measures

703
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,120
that you are taking to protect yourself

704
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,200
it's not it's still protecting yourself

705
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,039
it's self-defense it's not hacking back

706
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,919
let's look at this a different way

707
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,120
bang for the buck everything in cyber

708
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,760
security has to do in some way shape or

709
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,960
form with bang for the buck right

710
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
at the bottom of the blue pyramid

711
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,279
anyways we have architecture

712
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,120
lots of value in architecture done well

713
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,919
and done well and early

714
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,080
relatively little cost it doesn't cost a

715
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
lot of money to draw fancy pictures

716
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
or not so fancy use your napkins

717
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,279
and then

718
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,880
again if we're starting from that point

719
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
implement technology or tools to um

720
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,799
align with that architecture

721
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,279
and even passive defense there is a cost

722
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,840
in purchasing all of these fancy tools

723
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,919
and blinky lights and so on and so forth

724
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,400
but again we get significant value

725
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,840
compared to the cost of that passive

726
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,679
defense and as we move up the value

727
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,120
chain here though

728
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,559
active defense

729
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,240
i mean there's still absolutely value

730
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
there but not quite as much we don't get

731
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
the same bang for the buck

732
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,080
our cost is increased for slightly less

733
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
value that doesn't mean we don't do it

734
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
it's just let's start with the easy

735
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,640
things and build up from there right

736
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
and of course intelligence and offense

737
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,760
have

738
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
lesser value as we move up and higher

739
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,480
costs to do well and to do right so we

740
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,840
want to focus on i'll be talking today

741
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,200
about the bottom two levels of the value

742
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
proposition here that's where we can

743
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,760
have the biggest impact and we can have

744
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
an impact in an ics environment

745
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,960
no matter how difficult it is to get a

746
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,279
toehold in there for as a defender there

747
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,880
are ways we can have impact for sure

748
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,640
so what should you do

749
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
this list actually came from the drago's

750
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
urine review

751
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,520
uh report and i i thought it did a

752
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,400
really good job of bringing up to a high

753
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
level and summarizing

754
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
um

755
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,039
the

756
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,840
uh steps that you should be taking as a

757
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
defender

758
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
and the first one shocker is building a

759
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,440
defensible architecture so keyword there

760
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
is defensible though

761
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,440
we this is the point with architecture

762
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
this is where you get the value if you

763
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,919
can architect for example your networks

764
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,399
with strong segmentation

765
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
then that gives you the ability to

766
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,159
control communication and that

767
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,159
segmentation also gives you choke points

768
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
where you can monitor so that defensible

769
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,320
architecture it's implementing your

770
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,720
networks and your systems in such a way

771
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,039
that it's easy to apply additional

772
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,679
security controls right

773
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,640
network monitoring is key especially

774
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,799
network monitoring we have a whole

775
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,760
variety of systems in ics a lot of them

776
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,399
old a lot of them turn key

777
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
we may not you know they may

778
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
be commodity operating systems we may

779
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
not have access to them they may not be

780
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,240
commodity operating systems uh they need

781
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,039
to work in a deterministic fashion so we

782
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,520
may not be able to borrow cpu cycles to

783
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,679
do anti-malware things

784
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,279
that leaves us with the network where we

785
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
can have the biggest impact so we

786
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,080
absolutely need that network monitoring

787
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
because we're not going to be able to

788
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
touch all of the endpoints in an ics

789
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,960
environment no matter how much we try

790
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
control of remote access and

791
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
authentication that's kind of two two

792
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,440
pieces because we care about

793
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,279
authentication throughout not just for

794
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,640
remote access

795
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
but obviously the all of the contractors

796
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,200
and vendors and staff who are coming in

797
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,679
via remote access that's a huge exposure

798
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,000
that we need to really control

799
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,240
authenticate and authorize

800
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,640
appropriately we want to manage key

801
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,720
vulnerabilities and that word key is

802
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,080
important

803
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,799
vulnerability management is a a tough

804
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,279
conversation in most worlds i.t let

805
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,720
alone ot

806
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
so we need to be selective but we

807
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,080
absolutely do need to manage some

808
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
vulnerabilities

809
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
and know what's going to happen when

810
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
something goes wrong when we're under

811
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,919
attack or you know maybe it's not

812
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,640
malicious but something's gone wrong

813
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,360
a lot of ics environments

814
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,640
have pretty

815
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,360
robust plans for when something goes

816
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,679
wrong in the real world you know a leak

817
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,200
a fire uh

818
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
whatever right

819
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,320
and they think they're prepared but very

820
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
often these safety assessments and the

821
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,440
incident

822
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,480
plans and so on don't take cyber into

823
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
account number one they don't account

824
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,240
for the fact that cyber could cause

825
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
the incident i keep saying cyber i'm

826
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
trying to stop but

827
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
that they could cause the problem in the

828
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
first place

829
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,960
but also

830
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,600
that um

831
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,399
the the electronic systems can be a part

832
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,799
of the solution or can be the thing

833
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,720
that's actually impacted and that we

834
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,640
need to recover there's so much there

835
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,240
that isn't necessarily taken into

836
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,559
account uh in a lot of instant response

837
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,480
plans so you absolutely need some

838
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
capability

839
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,279
to gather information to figure out

840
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,880
what's there to contain the damage to

841
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
respond

842
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
and and

843
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,279
well respond to an incident

844
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,440
these are the top five things

845
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,679
uh five categories of things to keep in

846
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
mind this is the starting point for ics

847
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
security for everyone this is where we

848
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
need to begin

849
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,880
but

850
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,840
but

851
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,880
but i can't i've been here for 40 years

852
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
and nothing has gone wrong yet why do i

853
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
need to change anything now

854
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,640
well i'm making a trillion dollars every

855
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,200
second i can't stop now for you to do

856
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,360
some security stuff

857
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,799
i'm short staffed

858
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,080
do you know what it's like getting

859
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,440
people to work

860
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,159
come work at the top of the mountain and

861
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,440
up north and

862
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,919
the snow and rain and sleet and whatever

863
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,360
i don't have the people they don't have

864
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
the time they have other things to do

865
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,559
they're busy making me money we don't

866
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,120
have time for security i guess that's

867
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
the other priorities as well we need to

868
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,559
make more money

869
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,559
do more of the thing manufacture more of

870
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,320
the thing whatever it is

871
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
um

872
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,799
yeah you know

873
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,880
we can put that in we could do that

874
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,720
security thing you want to do

875
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,799
but how do we know a year from now it's

876
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,320
not just going to blow up and cause a

877
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,240
major outage

878
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,279
um

879
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,360
well you know this we've

880
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,039
along the lines of the it's been

881
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,679
operating for 40 years well

882
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,320
what tools do you have that that can

883
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,279
work with my 40 year old stuff right

884
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,440
or maybe you can you've got some great

885
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,679
capabilities over here but guess what

886
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,480
this is a plant it's not just one system

887
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,440
it's a system of systems of systems from

888
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
multiple vendors installed and managed

889
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
by multiple different people

890
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,440
and if you touch one thing you touch

891
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,240
them all and we just can't do that

892
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,399
or or maybe the vendor says you're not

893
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,080
going to touch my stuff

894
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,799
we got this we got this

895
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,960
you're not you're not authorized to make

896
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,720
changes we're not going to support you

897
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
if you do anything to

898
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,039
change our default deployment which of

899
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,159
course

900
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:12,960
is

901
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,320
deployed for safety and operations and

902
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,440
reliability and making money not for

903
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
cyber security so there are you know if

904
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
you uh go out and talk

905
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,880
to an engineer and operator there's lots

906
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,960
of reasons you can't do anything

907
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
that this list is is actually a short

908
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,480
one

909
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,919
and this is what we have to overcome

910
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,880
that's part of what we have to do

911
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,799
so what can you do

912
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,640
you know what

913
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,200
i know it's it's it's uh

914
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,120
a bit trite but it's a marathon it's not

915
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,519
a sprint right let's get better let's

916
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,600
let's do what we can to get better

917
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,679
everything in ics is planning for the

918
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,960
future right

919
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,760
on the extreme end you think nuclear

920
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,880
you may be in planning and design for 10

921
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,080
to 20 years before

922
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,200
a nuclear reactor facility goes live so

923
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,000
it's okay to plan for five years from

924
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,399
now i'd like to see some incremental

925
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,200
improvement along the way but it's okay

926
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,760
to take that gradual approach and plan

927
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,919
for the future

928
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,519
architecture i didn't put the air quotes

929
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,159
in there is free you can certainly start

930
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,720
again building those best case templates

931
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
and so on and so forth

932
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
knowing what you want it to look like in

933
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,399
the future so you can start building

934
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
towards that

935
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,320
virtualization is giving us a lot more

936
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,039
tools to reduce impact to reduce

937
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,640
interruption to reduce downtime to

938
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,159
recover if something does go wrong

939
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,240
snapshots and so on

940
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,080
vendors are being forced and are

941
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,240
choosing to come to the table we just

942
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
have to get on their latest and greatest

943
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,640
or newer stuff

944
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,320
you've got new initiatives there's

945
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,200
always an acquisition or a new plant or

946
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,039
a new well or a new city or a new

947
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,840
substation or renew something start

948
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,200
there right

949
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,039
it's it's something and use that as your

950
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,279
model and move from there

951
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,159
the c-suite is certainly much more aware

952
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,760
of cyber risk

953
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,639
to

954
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,599
ics uh so there's there's

955
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,918
you know it may be misdirected at times

956
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,960
it may not it may be hard to actualize

957
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,879
and to realize in the real world but

958
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,320
there's certainly more buy-in from the

959
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,960
c-suite there's more visibility

960
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,359
and you know what we don't have to touch

961
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,879
the process

962
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,918
if you really dig down

963
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,599
there's lots of stuff that's critical

964
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,960
don't get me wrong

965
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,320
but it's still this stuff over here

966
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,839
that's critical

967
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,399
this is the stuff that is cranking out

968
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,800
the electricity or whatever it is

969
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,679
on a 24 7 basis this stuff over here it

970
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,800
helps us it helps us charge people money

971
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,280
it helps us monitor it helps us see as

972
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
human beings what's going on it helps

973
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,640
helps us um track efficiency and tune

974
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,480
and so on but it's not part of the

975
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
process directly

976
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,839
um

977
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,520
maybe we can start there and start

978
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,880
securing at the boundary because

979
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,640
remember i made a big deal out of this

980
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,079
the attacker is coming in through the

981
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,280
boundary your core process is not at the

982
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,440
boundary so let's start there

983
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,920
and of course visibility monitoring in

984
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,560
and of itself is not disruptive so start

985
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,079
use that monitoring to get your asset

986
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,280
inventory to figure out what you're

987
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
dealing with and go from there

988
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,320
so i kind of spoiled some of this but

989
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,400
here's where we start

990
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,079
architecture right high value low cost

991
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,760
let's like anything in it and especially

992
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,359
cyber security

993
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,599
what does good look like

994
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,079
all i want you to do

995
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,400
oh and i didn't i forgot i was on this

996
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,520
slide before we start here this i'll get

997
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,079
back to this

998
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,680
we need

999
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,640
relationships this is the thing i forgot

1000
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,839
um

1001
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,839
before we get to architecture although

1002
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,280
not really before we can do it in

1003
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,400
parallel

1004
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,200
but the one thing that you will not the

1005
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,920
you will not succeed at bringing any

1006
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,839
security to an industrial control

1007
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,760
environment if you don't have

1008
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,599
relationships with the

1009
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,240
the people on the ground so to speak

1010
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,720
with the operators with the engineers

1011
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
with the technicians

1012
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,240
if you don't have a good working

1013
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,119
relationship you will not succeed

1014
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,720
i had my best success when we spent over

1015
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,760
a year just helping out in the ot

1016
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,280
environment not doing security just

1017
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,760
helping make things better improve

1018
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,920
technology figure out vmware and storage

1019
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,000
and so on and learning and meeting

1020
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,599
people and making relationships and

1021
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,359
understanding the business drivers and

1022
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,839
the requirements along the way

1023
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,359
that's where we start

1024
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,680
i i even jumped jumped the shark here a

1025
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,599
bit and got ahead of myself we need to

1026
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
start with the people side of things if

1027
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,079
we can't speak to

1028
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
why it's important

1029
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,480
but why we're not going to screw things

1030
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
up we're not going to cause an outage

1031
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,560
you might actually be more safe as a

1032
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
result of the work we're doing

1033
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,800
we need to do this in a nice you know in

1034
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,560
a collaborative way we can't just come

1035
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,880
in and preach the gospel right

1036
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,280
so relationships if you don't get those

1037
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,760
in place you can't start there

1038
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,160
so where to start figure out what good

1039
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,839
looks like

1040
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,720
again

1041
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,560
any anytime i talk to anybody about

1042
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,960
anything in cyber security you know what

1043
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,680
let's set a target what is our goal

1044
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,160
where do we want to end up and let's

1045
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,000
let's start with the easy or gradually

1046
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
how about every decision you make from

1047
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,119
now on

1048
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,560
you look at it in the context of where

1049
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,320
you want to be in three to five years

1050
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,400
and you try not to move further away

1051
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,320
even maintaining the status quo is kind

1052
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,920
of a win let's try to move a little bit

1053
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,000
closer though right so let's develop

1054
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
those templates for where we want to be

1055
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,400
so we can articulate it so when we we

1056
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,960
bring a new site online we can use that

1057
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
template and we can at least get that

1058
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,359
site looking the way we want it to so

1059
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,599
that when we have scheduled maintenance

1060
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,000
or are deploying new systems or whatever

1061
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,480
we can we can align with what good looks

1062
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
like and get there over time it's a long

1063
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,200
game so the new sites the site refresh

1064
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,320
and again

1065
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,000
start at the itot internet remote access

1066
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,240
vendor connections boundary

1067
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,920
those systems there

1068
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,280
i mean everyone will jump up and down

1069
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
and tell you how critical they are and

1070
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,480
they are important systems

1071
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
but

1072
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,520
a screw up there

1073
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,640
is not the same thing as a screw up at

1074
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
the process level right we can start

1075
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,200
there we have commodity operating

1076
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
systems

1077
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
mostly windows and traditional networky

1078
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
stuff at this layer let's start with

1079
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,520
that and then move on from there

1080
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,880
that's that's architecture

1081
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,520
some of the things to consider

1082
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
hey how about we actually talk to people

1083
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,359
and figure out what the requirements are

1084
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,240
both for security and for the business

1085
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
you know we might know okay we produce

1086
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,240
electricity or oil and gas or widgets or

1087
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
whatever it is so the business driver

1088
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
should be obvious but they aren't always

1089
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,520
right what understanding what drives the

1090
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
business what's important to them you

1091
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
know it's it's a little bit of a cliche

1092
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
as well but what that really bad day

1093
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,640
looks like because you can't protect at

1094
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
all so what are the most important

1095
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
things to protect you know if we show up

1096
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
on site

1097
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,920
and safety systems are on the network

1098
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
well we start there they should never be

1099
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,920
on the network those are your fail-safe

1100
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
for when things go bad on the network

1101
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,480
like like that is number one right

1102
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
safety

1103
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,960
business operations figure out what the

1104
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,200
requirements are and then

1105
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,680
i'll talk about labels a bit more here

1106
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,720
slap

1107
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,640
a virtual i don't mean slap a label on

1108
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,440
everything slap a label on everything

1109
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,440
virtually know what it is what it's for

1110
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,599
what its requirements are

1111
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,119
you know for for availability for access

1112
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,079
for security for operation all of that

1113
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,160
know what you have right

1114
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
first couple critical controls it's just

1115
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,760
another way of saying it know what you

1116
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,640
have out there what it's for group them

1117
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
together so that you can deal with them

1118
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,760
in a priority fashion in groups

1119
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,520
build out that or sorry you're

1120
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
architecting at this point so design

1121
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that strong itot boundary with dmz

1122
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,480
with remote access including vendor

1123
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,240
connections partner connections all of

1124
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,200
that remote type stuff file transfer as

1125
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,040
well a secure way to get files in and

1126
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,319
out

1127
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,079
segment your network so you've grouped

1128
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,319
everything so based on those groupings

1129
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,440
and labels

1130
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,599
you want to architect your network such

1131
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,240
that things that are grouped together

1132
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,160
are on a common network but that we've

1133
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
got a segment a boundary

1134
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,560
um enforcement of communication or flow

1135
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,160
of communication between those different

1136
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,079
segments so we at least have the

1137
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,880
opportunity to introduce some level of

1138
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,079
control

1139
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,880
and

1140
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720
in doing all this it kind of happens

1141
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,520
naturally but ensure that you have a way

1142
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,760
to get visibility whether that's with a

1143
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
tap a span port net flow

1144
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
all of the above firewall logs audit

1145
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,680
logs

1146
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,000
ideally all of it so make sure you you

1147
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
have a way to get visibility away to

1148
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,200
monitor and a way to respond a way to

1149
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,000
act you've architected an environment

1150
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
where you can see what's going on and

1151
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,880
you can act when you need to

1152
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,640
but architecture only gets us so far

1153
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,520
before i move on to um the the passive

1154
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,880
defense

1155
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,760
this is the based on the purdue model

1156
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,839
essentially this is the purdue model

1157
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,839
we've got our level zero through level

1158
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,760
five systems we've got our enterprise

1159
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,599
dmz at the top safety at the bottom i'm

1160
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,200
not going to spend a ton of time going

1161
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,520
through this but i just put this in here

1162
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,079
to reiterate this is what i mean by

1163
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,760
labeling

1164
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,000
i can tell you i can sit here and talk

1165
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,440
to this for a while and i'll come back

1166
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,599
to it later you know here's where i want

1167
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,200
firewalls enforcement boundaries

1168
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,040
segmentation segregation here's what

1169
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,880
dmz's need to look like

1170
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,359
i can't do any of this unless i know

1171
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,680
what my level 1 systems are my what are

1172
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,800
my dcs and rtu and plcs what are my

1173
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
aggregate historians what are my local

1174
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,640
historians et cetera et cetera this is

1175
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,599
again back to the inventory and labeling

1176
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,839
until i know what these things are

1177
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,200
i can't

1178
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,960
i can't segment them i can't architect a

1179
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,640
network to protect them

1180
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,880
the purdue model gives us great guidance

1181
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
just for labeling that's all it is in my

1182
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,119
opinion is a way to slap these labels on

1183
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,079
sensors and actuators oh level zero rtu

1184
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,480
plc dcs level one

1185
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
communications gateways local historians

1186
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,040
alarm servers hmis level two

1187
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,280
a lot of the other stuff level three

1188
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,760
chunked into different chunks

1189
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,640
and if i have my acid inventory i have

1190
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,040
my visibility and i've put

1191
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,800
level labels

1192
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,880
on everything now i can start to build

1193
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,599
firewall rules and and written policy

1194
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,200
that said these this is the kind of

1195
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,640
authentication or this is the kind of

1196
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
backup or virtualization or whatever it

1197
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,440
is

1198
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,280
um that's

1199
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,760
that's why i'm harping on the the

1200
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,839
inventory and the labeling because once

1201
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,000
i have that then i can draw generic

1202
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,680
pictures and i can build those templates

1203
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
to tell me how to protect the different

1204
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,720
classes of devices

1205
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,800
some key tenets from an architecture

1206
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,520
perspective we do not want internet in

1207
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,319
our ot network there are very

1208
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,800
specific exceptions where maybe we need

1209
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,880
to download something on a regular basis

1210
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,240
well then we should have a proxy server

1211
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,040
that allows that and nothing but that

1212
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,119
if you need email internet web browsing

1213
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,480
other things then have a dedicated

1214
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,839
business computer

1215
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,200
i've been talking a lot about the

1216
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,240
enforcement boundaries so i won't won't

1217
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
spend too much time on this but we want

1218
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,000
separate authentication we don't want to

1219
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
be shared with the corporate network

1220
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,280
including mfa for all access into ics we

1221
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,119
need to provide a mechanism to transfer

1222
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,560
files securely without malware

1223
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
it kind of goes without saying but let's

1224
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,359
try a deny by default and permit what we

1225
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,160
need

1226
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,319
and these enforcement boundaries are an

1227
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,000
ideal point

1228
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,040
to

1229
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
monitor and log communication in both

1230
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,520
directions

1231
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,280
use ad as much as it parts of me kind of

1232
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,920
cringe when i say this

1233
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,319
we have a lot of windows in ics networks

1234
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,079
leverage in active directory not your

1235
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,520
corporate active directory completely

1236
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,839
disconnected and not managed by an

1237
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,599
engineer managed by someone who

1238
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,040
understands a.d

1239
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,599
but it gives us group policy it gives us

1240
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,680
authentication a lot of security

1241
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
controls that we can leverage

1242
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,000
and then manage the antivirus patching

1243
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,599
all of that stuff

1244
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,359
on the ot network separate from the

1245
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,160
business network

1246
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,240
that brings us to passive defense

1247
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
these are the the five categories

1248
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
they're they're kind of somewhat tied to

1249
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,280
the the five things you should do that i

1250
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,680
mentioned earlier of passive defense

1251
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,040
that we

1252
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,800
um i'm going to talk about anyways

1253
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,599
enforcement boundaries again i'll move

1254
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,839
on authentication and authorization

1255
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,680
though is a huge part of our passive

1256
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,079
defense protecting our endpoints to the

1257
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,040
extent we can getting our visibility or

1258
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,200
monitoring our logging and then managing

1259
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,520
those vulnerabilities patching i will

1260
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,800
get there that's always a fun

1261
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,640
conversation

1262
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,440
so the enforcement boundary

1263
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,359
it's generally easier as i mentioned to

1264
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,440
apply security at the network layer

1265
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,400
start with that itot dmz boundary

1266
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,960
segment the ot network further though

1267
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,480
you know put your active directory

1268
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,280
systems your jump servers your security

1269
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,920
related systems your antivirus systems

1270
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,119
uh

1271
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,280
your your engineering workstations

1272
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,720
versus your operator workstations

1273
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,079
whatever group them together on

1274
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,480
dedicated networks so you have at least

1275
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,760
an ability

1276
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,640
to

1277
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,839
um

1278
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,440
control access

1279
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,680
right even if you're not today at least

1280
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,280
segment so that you can get there in the

1281
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
future and then enforce that policy at

1282
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
the network level

1283
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,000
we want

1284
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
also to have a minor enforcement

1285
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,319
boundary between levels two and three

1286
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,960
and sometimes within level 3 to help us

1287
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,200
contain access to stop the pivoting and

1288
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,520
contain a compromise and as i mentioned

1289
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
manage that remote access and file

1290
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:22,880
transfer

1291
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,800
so popping this up one more time what

1292
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,480
i'm getting at is

1293
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,960
we want this red line here is a minor

1294
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,240
enforcement boundary it might be an

1295
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,400
access list on a router or something

1296
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,800
but i'm separating level two from level

1297
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,960
three where i have the ability to and

1298
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,119
i'll come back to that on the next slide

1299
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,880
maybe i take my engineering workstation

1300
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,400
my jump servers active directory all the

1301
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
things i talked about and i put these on

1302
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,119
different segments within level three so

1303
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,200
that i can have finer drain control of

1304
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,440
communication back and forth

1305
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,480
obviously around the dmz possibly

1306
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,400
multiple dmz so it's

1307
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,119
one of our primary goals of this dmz

1308
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,280
without going too far into the weeds is

1309
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,800
so that we can't get a single

1310
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,640
bi-directional connection

1311
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,920
like command and control if you think

1312
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,680
about command and control we want to

1313
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,920
prevent that so if you want to move data

1314
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,079
from level 4 down it goes through this

1315
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,400
dmz terminated on a system here we want

1316
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,440
to move it up completely separate dmz so

1317
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,520
now your ability to have bi-directional

1318
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,280
communication is

1319
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,640
is minimized it's made much harder so we

1320
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,480
want these enforcement boundaries at

1321
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,319
multiple points here

1322
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,040
and this is a slightly different view

1323
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,800
if you look at a wide area network i

1324
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,280
might have a plant network some remote

1325
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,040
substations well pads whatever they

1326
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,400
might be

1327
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,960
i also want the ability if something bad

1328
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,800
happens here

1329
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
i want to prevent that from impacting

1330
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,480
the rest of my network so by having an

1331
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,319
enforcement boundary between levels two

1332
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,599
and three

1333
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,240
i can then isolate this um this site and

1334
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,559
prevent it from being impacted by other

1335
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,880
sites or impacting other sites i can cut

1336
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,359
off or if i have an

1337
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,359
i.t you know a compromise coming in from

1338
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,359
the business network at the it level

1339
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,319
well i can cut off below level three or

1340
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,040
or cut off the field let them operate on

1341
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,960
their own but again containing the

1342
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,200
damage continuing to operate in a

1343
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,680
minimum viable state right we don't want

1344
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,280
to run in that state all the time but if

1345
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,359
we have a minimum viable state and we

1346
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,440
have a process and a way

1347
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,559
to

1348
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,119
reduce our footprint to that in order to

1349
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,359
contain something bad that's perfectly

1350
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,880
fine and that's something we want the

1351
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,280
capability to do

1352
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,400
all right enough about enforcement

1353
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,240
boundaries

1354
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
authentication authorization i talked

1355
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,359
about a dedicated ad and leverage that

1356
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,520
centralized authentication ldap radius

1357
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,680
tacacs whatever it is

1358
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,800
so that

1359
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,240
we don't because we have lots of

1360
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,559
contractors we have lots of transient

1361
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,920
people coming in and out of ics networks

1362
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
local accounts shared accounts shared

1363
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,119
passwords

1364
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,480
aren't ideal

1365
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,839
those passwords go spread far and wide

1366
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,559
we centralize one we get logs of every

1367
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,079
action people take because or every

1368
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,640
login at least because it's centralized

1369
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,400
and provisioning and de-provisioning are

1370
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,920
so much easier

1371
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,480
we want dedicated ot accounts but we

1372
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,680
want those tied into corporate

1373
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,359
provisioning so that if someone leaves

1374
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,440
something actually gets done about it

1375
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,520
privileged access in ot networks is just

1376
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,880
as important as in it networks i've seen

1377
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,760
many an ot domain where every single

1378
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,839
operator was a domain admin we want to

1379
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,920
control those kinds of things we want

1380
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,839
network level controls so you cannot

1381
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,319
connect to management interfaces unless

1382
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,599
you're supposed to

1383
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,200
as i mentioned limit the generic and

1384
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,200
shared accounts and secure that remote

1385
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,400
access so

1386
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,960
i i have a whole different webcast and

1387
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,839
blog post on secure remote access but

1388
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,400
multi-factor dedicated credentials

1389
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,480
minimum access separate people by roles

1390
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,760
there's a whole bunch of stuff that we

1391
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,319
can do there

1392
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,680
endpoints where we can again close to

1393
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,599
that itot boundary where windows

1394
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,000
proliferates we want to leverage active

1395
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,240
directory group policy for those

1396
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,280
security controls have a secure baseline

1397
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,359
so that we can pull a device off the

1398
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,119
shelf and see what's changed so we can

1399
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,359
do instant response we know what good

1400
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,440
looks like

1401
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,480
again back to the new site new location

1402
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,119
new deployment green field type scenario

1403
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,040
how about part you know these are static

1404
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,000
environments partner with the vendor and

1405
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,160
lock these systems down as much as you

1406
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,000
can before they go live before they're

1407
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,559
deployed get that secure baseline

1408
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,440
application control is absolutely doable

1409
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,920
in that context app locker for example

1410
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,319
work with the vendor it's a static-ish

1411
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,400
environment so get that done where you

1412
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,640
can certainly use anti-malware where

1413
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,640
it's permitted impossible

1414
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,119
endpoint firewall so i talked at ad

1415
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,480
nauseum about

1416
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,160
segmentation if you can't do it at the

1417
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,079
network layer do it at the endpoint

1418
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:58,880
layer

1419
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,480
everything should be fairly static and

1420
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
you can validate that during your site

1421
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,160
acceptance or pre-deployment testing

1422
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,160
right there's a lot you can do there

1423
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,400
and of course visibility monitoring

1424
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,920
logging

1425
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,319
passive monitoring that's where we start

1426
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,800
we're not talking about scanning you can

1427
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,359
do it very very very carefully um

1428
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,800
ideally don't

1429
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,400
but sometimes there's there are

1430
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,920
legitimate reasons to be scanned but

1431
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,599
just look at what's coming by on the

1432
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,559
network we can tell a lot from that so

1433
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,000
set up your enforcement boundaries your

1434
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,200
checkpoints so you can get that

1435
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,520
visibility it'll build your asset

1436
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,280
inventory it'll tell you about

1437
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,839
vulnerabilities in many cases it'll tell

1438
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,400
you um who's talking to who help you

1439
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,280
build

1440
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,559
that

1441
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,960
those network segments

1442
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,040
your segmentation model and your

1443
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,800
firewall model maybe you'll find the

1444
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,119
vulnerabilities and improve that login

1445
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,280
maturity

1446
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,280
logging in ot is almost always much

1447
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,960
worse than in it

1448
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,720
and the way i like to look at this is

1449
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,720
levels of maturity for logging i won't

1450
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,200
again go into massive detail but let's

1451
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,640
call xero

1452
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,480
no login

1453
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,000
that's the worst

1454
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,240
one would be i've got logs but they're

1455
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,680
all over their place they're on local

1456
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,359
devices you know i don't do anything

1457
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,200
with them but they're at least logging

1458
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,359
you know what great

1459
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,599
at least i can show up and get access to

1460
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,280
logs and see what happened as opposed to

1461
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,000
not that's that to me is awesome you

1462
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,400
know seven days worth of logs is way

1463
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,680
better than nothing now

1464
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,960
we would like it

1465
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,880
well configured to log appropriate

1466
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,960
things for instant response that's

1467
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,880
another level of maturity and then we'd

1468
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,319
actually like to centralize those logs

1469
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,920
to make our lives easier

1470
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,880
and you know what if we're going to

1471
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,640
centralize them we kind of want them in

1472
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,240
something like a sim or a database

1473
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,640
whatever a searchable

1474
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,280
place and you know maybe we want some

1475
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,640
use cases

1476
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,160
and and um automatic alerting against

1477
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,000
that and then people actioning those

1478
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,240
alerts and looking at the logs and then

1479
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,000
correlating between multiple sources you

1480
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,960
see there's many levels there honestly

1481
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,520
get logging enabled and maybe collect it

1482
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,280
centrally i'm going to be ecstatic in an

1483
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,319
ics environment and i mean logging from

1484
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,480
the process logging from controllers

1485
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,000
administrative access and your

1486
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,680
traditional windows firewall networking

1487
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,440
type remote access logs

1488
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,000
got a few minutes left vulnerabilities

1489
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,760
in patching

1490
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,599
i can't do this justice in in a few

1491
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,280
minutes but

1492
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,119
first thing to recognize is not all

1493
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,200
vulnerabilities need to be patched we

1494
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,680
are dealing with environments

1495
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,720
where controllers do take action with

1496
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,040
zero authentication

1497
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,119
in that environment it doesn't really

1498
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,960
matter if it's vulnerable if it will do

1499
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,119
anything i tell it to do so let's start

1500
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,280
with not worrying about that stuff

1501
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,480
okay

1502
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,400
and then let's also recognize that when

1503
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,160
it comes down to the actual control

1504
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,640
systems two things one they're going to

1505
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,440
be really hard to patch uh it takes more

1506
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,920
work outages diligence etcetera testing

1507
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,200
validation

1508
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,640
and two

1509
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,119
with exceptions obviously

1510
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,200
to get to those systems coming back to

1511
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,319
my attack chain um the kill chain sorry

1512
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,880
and landing just inside the itot

1513
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,359
boundary on those window systems

1514
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,359
you're coming through the window systems

1515
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,119
to get to

1516
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,640
those uh you're coming through the level

1517
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,319
three systems basically to get to the

1518
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,559
lower level systems to attack them so

1519
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,559
let's start by patching and and locking

1520
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,119
things down at that level three level

1521
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,839
three and a half itot boundary dmz

1522
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,839
it's also much easier to patch windows

1523
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,480
systems i was talking to a customer

1524
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,559
you know about their patching and and

1525
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,799
how they keep things up to date and you

1526
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,400
know they had some understandable gaps

1527
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,920
where they couldn't bring systems down

1528
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,520
but their domain controllers had never

1529
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,400
ever been patched like there's different

1530
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,720
categories of systems

1531
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,640
i get it when you can't patch certain

1532
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,599
things

1533
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,440
uh or certainly not as much as you like

1534
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,319
but your dc's you've got multiples like

1535
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,839
this stuff that is the keys to your

1536
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,920
kingdom that kind of stuff needs to be

1537
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,640
done

1538
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,960
you've got redundancy patch one half

1539
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,920
then the other half you've got

1540
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,520
virtualization

1541
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,200
again i'm not talking about the process

1542
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,760
itself necessarily but patch if there's

1543
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,520
a problem roll back

1544
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,280
and and i'm not saying it's easy so

1545
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,040
prioritize those things like the domain

1546
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,359
controllers the jump servers the the

1547
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,920
stuff around the edges that's where we

1548
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,079
need to focus

1549
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,040
i won't

1550
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,400
spend too much time on this because i

1551
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,359
want to leave a few minutes for

1552
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,480
questions

1553
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,160
um but here is a

1554
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,200
an approach to patching right first

1555
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,960
does a patch exist

1556
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,680
does it affect me no don't care

1557
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,920
is it an emergency patch

1558
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,520
so we need to categorize it yes okay

1559
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,359
um if not we're not dealing with it

1560
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,680
right now it's an emergency patch does

1561
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,799
our operational need outweigh the risk

1562
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,559
in other words

1563
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,359
does the impact to the business from the

1564
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,680
act of patching or from the act of

1565
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,200
having patched and causing an outage

1566
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,799
further down the line

1567
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,119
does that outweigh the risk of the

1568
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,440
vulnerability being exploited it's a

1569
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,520
decision we need to make if operational

1570
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,280
needs are greater then again we're not

1571
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,880
going to patch right now

1572
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,119
if operational needs are not greater we

1573
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,119
think the risk is significant look for

1574
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,520
an alternate mitigation if that exists

1575
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,960
well mitigate and and and exit

1576
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,280
only if all only if we go all the way

1577
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,480
through to the end here do we patch

1578
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,799
immediately and for many organizations

1579
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,480
there there are caveats to that patch

1580
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,920
immediately but we're going to try and

1581
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,119
do something

1582
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,599
and then of course if we didn't then we

1583
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,200
patched during the next window either

1584
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,839
way we document and continue right it's

1585
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,520
just a way to think about the patching

1586
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,839
process

1587
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,400
um it's very much not an all or nothing

1588
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,200
thing but it's also very much not a

1589
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,760
nothing thing we need to do something

1590
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,920
manage our risk as best we can

1591
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,160
so patching is important

1592
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,760
to a point vulnerabilities are important

1593
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,280
to a point it's something we have to be

1594
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,000
aware with and deal with um sometimes

1595
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,559
that might be this next window might be

1596
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,000
a year from now

1597
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,160
and that may suck but it may be okay and

1598
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,240
that's when we focus our efforts at the

1599
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
boundary so that nobody can get there in

1600
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,879
the first place

1601
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,720
so to wrap up

1602
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,640
we want to strive for that active

1603
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,880
defense i i purposely stopped short of

1604
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,880
active defense here

1605
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
i kind of see architecture and passive

1606
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,839
defense as our minimum viable

1607
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,839
uh for for defense and we really want to

1608
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,440
get start getting into that active

1609
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,839
defense which is the repeated actions

1610
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,640
for ics defense analysts monitoring for

1611
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,000
responding to and learning from

1612
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,480
adversaries internal to the network so

1613
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,599
it's humans acting on threats that can

1614
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,079
be through threat intel consumption

1615
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,160
getting visibility detecting a threat

1616
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,440
responding

1617
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,119
and then changing things to um protect

1618
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,839
ourselves

1619
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,520
just to to recap again we've got the

1620
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,079
sliding scale right let's focus on these

1621
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,240
two here start with our architecture and

1622
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,400
our passive defense there's a ton of

1623
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,799
work to do here and we can do it

1624
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,720
overcome those objections build those

1625
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,079
relationships

1626
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,839
start small

1627
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,920
help where you can and

1628
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,200
even if it's not to do with security

1629
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,000
build the relationships and small baby

1630
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,040
steps

1631
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,079
gradually get better and strive to at

1632
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,760
least get to some of this middle

1633
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,119
territory

1634
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,079
and see if you can get beyond that

1635
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,480
different view bang for the buck again

1636
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,119
just reinforcing that this is where we

1637
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,520
have our bang for the buck so we want to

1638
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,920
focus on that architecture and it's a

1639
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,599
long game you know we're going to do the

1640
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,799
architecture

1641
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,720
um so that we can be better positioned a

1642
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,160
year two years three years from now

1643
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,079
that's okay

1644
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:48,960
right

1645
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,040
the worst thing we can do is just say

1646
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,760
it's hard it's risky i can't take an

1647
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,720
outage

1648
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,559
i'm not going to do anything we need to

1649
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,720
start planning we need to start

1650
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,480
building that mindshare building that

1651
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,559
momentum to do something to get better

1652
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,440
that's

1653
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,799
that's where the bar is at right now

1654
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,559
when i talk about raising the bar the

1655
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,359
bar

1656
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,079
it's kind of down here i just wanna

1657
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,680
let's get the bar off the ground right

1658
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,040
let's start there

1659
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,119
and and no offense to anybody who has

1660
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,280
done that already but

1661
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,000
by and large our ics security bar is

1662
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,599
pretty close to the ground no one's

1663
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,480
limboing under that thing

1664
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,359
just final slide to leave you with these

1665
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,839
five core

1666
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,319
defenses or things you should be areas

1667
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,480
of work you should be focusing on from a

1668
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,559
cyber security perspective

1669
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,920
defensible architecture we want to build

1670
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,799
a network that we can defend

1671
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,480
to do that we need monitoring we need to

1672
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,240
be able to see what's going on on that

1673
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,680
network

1674
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,280
remote access

1675
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,680
um access control authentication that

1676
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,440
boundary that

1677
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,599
entrance point for everybody absolutely

1678
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:58,839
something we need to

1679
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,119
control key vulnerabilities the ones

1680
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,799
that can really hurt you we have to

1681
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,280
prioritize we can't do everything

1682
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,200
so let's manage them

1683
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,079
and

1684
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,200
it's going to happen be ready to respond

1685
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,920
from an i.t from a cyber from a cyber

1686
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,720
security perspective and absolutely

1687
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,160
integrate that with your business

1688
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,480
continuity and disaster and your your

1689
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,240
incident command structure and all of

1690
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,640
that but recognize

1691
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,000
that the i t or cyber world can be the

1692
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,599
cause of an outage

1693
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,640
and

1694
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,000
um

1695
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,400
its loss can also

1696
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,839
in and of itself it can cause you an

1697
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,280
outage so you may have to do instant

1698
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,480
response but it may also be integral to

1699
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,079
responding to a different kind of

1700
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,920
incident in a different area so all of

1701
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,400
that or related incident all of that is

1702
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,760
important from an incident response

1703
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,599
perspective

1704
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,040
so i left uh two minutes for questions

1705
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,960
apologies not quite

1706
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,760
there but if anyone has any questions

1707
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,520
please let me know

1708
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,200
put them in the chat

1709
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,119
you can find me on linkedin and other

1710
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,880
places

1711
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,599
and i will share these slides as well so

1712
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,000
i hope you enjoyed that and i hope uh to

1713
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,520
see you out there

1714
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,119
lifting that bar and hopefully the

1715
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,400
weights on the end of that bar are not

1716
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,960
too heavy

1717
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,000
and yes don't forget the relationships

1718
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,839
thank you very much for that comment

1719
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,920
um absolutely where you have to start if

1720
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,680
you don't have friends you're not

1721
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,119
getting anywhere

1722
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,119
fast

1723
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,079
yeah patching is not the only answer

1724
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,240
there are key patches we need to get in

1725
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,400
quite often domain controllers as an

1726
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,680
example

1727
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,240
but uh yeah it's an insecure by design

1728
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,599
environment patching doesn't help with

1729
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,839
that other things help with that so

1730
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,240
let's be selective use our

1731
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,279
energy wisely

1732
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,200
honestly when so i would the operators

1733
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
demanding testing in a like environment

1734
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,880
so i ask them where is your like

1735
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,160
environment because you're making

1736
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,319
changes all the time and then they scowl

1737
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,000
at me and we agree to disagree and

1738
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,359
whatever but

1739
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,520
putting that aside

1740
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,240
during there are scheduled outages

1741
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,760
there's scheduled maintenance and we

1742
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,200
need to make security part of those

1743
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,760
schedule maintenance um outage windows

1744
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,079
because at the end of those windows

1745
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,440
usually they have to go through site

1746
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,359
acceptance testing again

1747
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,520
so that's the time where we can really

1748
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,119
do a lot of these things

1749
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,760
is is during especially the lower levels

1750
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,680
during those regularly scheduled um

1751
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,720
windows or pre-deployment partner with

1752
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,160
the vendor there's nothing wrong with

1753
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
saying the vendor hey you know what

1754
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,440
we're going to do a bunch of security

1755
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,960
work for you that you can reuse with

1756
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,640
other customers as long as you're

1757
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,720
willing to work with us and build this

1758
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,640
out and and

1759
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,280
land in a better place but it almost

1760
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,280
exclusively has to be done

1761
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,839
pre-deployment so focus on those brand

1762
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,200
new sites or those those site refreshes

1763
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,000
that's we've we can do enough work in

1764
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,799
those areas um that we can make that

1765
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,319
improvement over time without having to

1766
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,520
worry about the sites that we can't

1767
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,799
touch today

1768
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,880
that'd be my take it's not perfect but

1769
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,240
you know there's sites you can't touch

1770
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,760
today and that's that's going to be the

1771
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,440
way it is until you've

1772
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,880
proven the solution in other locations

1773
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:34,880
all right

1774
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
thank you everyone i'll all hang out to

1775
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
see if there's any uh

1776
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,720
other comments just in general in the

1777
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,960
chat and uh

1778
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,960
hope you enjoyed that no like i said see

1779
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,680
