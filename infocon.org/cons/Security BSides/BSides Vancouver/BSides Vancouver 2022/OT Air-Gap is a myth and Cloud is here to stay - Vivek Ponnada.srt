1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
um vivekponada i am um oh so it looks

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,640
like the slides are available so let me

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,759
just share my slides

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,360
okay

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
is it working now ashley

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
okay perfect so

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,240
we'll continue so

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
quick background uh i've been in the

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
industrial control space all my life

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,680
i've been doing ot security for the past

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,199
eight and a half years

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,480
my background i have an engineering

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,359
degree and also an mba in finance and a

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,920
sensor for industrial control so

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,600
when i'm talking usually i talk with the

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
uh big bias towards operational

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,320
technology and in general ics space so

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
currently i work for nazomi networks i'm

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,160
the regional sales director for western

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
canada i'm based here in vancouver and

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,399
some of you know me from my um

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,800
participation in the community here

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,680
in b-sides as well as i say and isakka

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
and i also happen to lead co-lead with

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,239
sarah flux the top 20 secure plc coding

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
practices project

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,199
so

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
the interesting discussion for today

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
right quick peek at the agenda so air

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
gap was a thing so we'll go a little bit

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,159
deeper into

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,560
what that was and why it isn't valid

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
anymore and then let's talk about purdue

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
model and things that break the purdue

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
model and then reality check about where

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,119
we are

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,320
so

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
these pictures should tell you a good

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
story so on the left you see a big piece

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,159
of equipment doesn't matter to you what

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
that is it happens to be a steam turbine

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,400
producing power

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
but if you look at

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
this picture this is actually from

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
the early 1900s so 100 years later if

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
you walk into a turbine hall

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
the equipment look very similar so

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
the technology kind of all the

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
metallurgy evolved

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,799
the

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
the temperatures at which we run these

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,880
things evolved the amount of megawatts

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
that produce vault a lot of things kind

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
of evolved but they look very much

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,719
similar so

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,880
the key difference is back in those days

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
these sensors were all local so if

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
something was measuring pressure you

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
would display the pressure on this

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,239
indicator here something was measuring

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,318
temperature it would show up on the

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
gauge right there for an operator to go

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
and troubleshoot and click on things

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,520
right adjust levers adjust valves

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
anything that was local right so that's

66
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
all localized control and then

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
eventually now most of this control is

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
done by

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
programmable logic controllers plcs the

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
picture that you see at the top right

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
here and the sensors to have a vault so

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
here you see a pressure transmitter so

73
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
the fitting here the tubing that hasn't

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
changed in 100 years or actually

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
hundreds of years but the thing at the

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
top definitely evolved so that's all

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
digitized you see this local indication

78
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,120
but it also communicates to this

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,920
programmable logic controller over wires

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
so usually two wires that go in here

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
physical milliamps four to twenty

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,800
milliamp signal goes to the plc and then

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
four to twenty milliamp output also goes

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,519
to a valve you see this valve this is a

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,159
globe valve this hasn't changed in

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,200
hundreds of years however it now has a

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
smart positioner at the top so this

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
smart positioner not only does

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
control of the valve the valve position

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,519
but also gives you indication about you

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,200
know if the proximity switch that's

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
showing the open or closed feedback is

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,120
faulty or if the valve calibration is

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
out of whack meaning the zero position

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
the max position if they are not exactly

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,840
what they should be this smart

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
positioner can adjust it you can

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
calibrate the valve you can stroke the

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
valve meaning move the valve position

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
from remote

101
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
so those are the additional features we

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
got with these introductions of smart

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
features and this has nothing to do with

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
our smart 22nd century thing these

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,680
things happened in the

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
late 1900s so the sensors got smarter

107
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,560
the

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
end devices got smarter by tacking on

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
things to something that already worked

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,400
for 100 plus years okay

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
now the picture on the left i don't know

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,000
if you're able to see it clearly here um

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239
it's showing black on my side but

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,239
maybe that's well worth it so picture on

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,399
the left was supposed to be an older

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
control room okay

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
the older control room

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
the operator had limited view but they

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
still had a view they had data recorders

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
they had slides they had

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,120
paper charts they had a big red button

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
to push in case something was wrong

123
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,120
it looked pretty messy because you

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,199
needed direct connection from these

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,759
sensors and outputs actuators in front

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
of the operator but then to the right

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,560
where now the operator has a lot more

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
view right you see all these displays

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
all these video screens where they can

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
see live animations of where the process

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
is what pipeline has what temperatures

132
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
what product what pressures

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
what furnace uh you know is is burning

134
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
at what temperature all those things the

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
operator can see on a display right and

136
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,199
they can choose to rearrange they can

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,120
reorganize they can monitor the process

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
much better all the data is now in front

139
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
of the operator versus before when it

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,919
was a struggle to pick and choose what

141
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,000
was available okay

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that brings to the most famous ot model

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,280
that you'll ever see out there it's

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,039
called the purdue model

145
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
and i say that's a torchbearer ot

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
because that's what we use as a

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
reference whenever we see ot equipment

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
we say where does it line up in the

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
purdue model this model goes from level

150
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,759
zero to level five and i put the same

151
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,600
picture so that you can relate to them

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
so at level zero you have these sensors

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
and actuators right so

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
the pressure transmitter that we saw in

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
the previous picture

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
and the valve and the smart positioner

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
that we saw in the previous picture

158
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,199
would be considered level zero there is

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
some kind of processing some kind of

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
data historically like in the 60s 70s

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,360
80s and the 20th century

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
it was strictly milliamps and volts but

163
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,639
since then we added different protocols

164
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
that can bring in additional data like

165
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
hard protocol different field bus

166
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
protocols that now have more data so you

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
can now configure the transmitter to say

168
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,400
this transmitter would be called pt01 in

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,759
section one or you can configure this

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,440
smart positioner to say this is val 2001

171
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
controlling some kind of ethylene

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
equipment right so you can do all that

173
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,160
stuff at level zero at level one you

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,680
have these controllers programmable

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
logic controllers distributed control

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
systems and then at level two you have

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,800
this user interface right operator

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,199
interface or engineering workstation

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,160
that you use to download programs to the

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,240
plc's and the operator again same

181
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
picture so you can see how that lines up

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
in the purdue model

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,199
now air gap as we hear about it came in

184
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,479
because back in the day back in 19th

185
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
century early 20th century even late

186
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
20th century all these things were

187
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,759
limited in connectivity so the amount of

188
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
data that went from zero to one was

189
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
strictly limited to whatever the sensor

190
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,479
information was and whatever the valve

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
output needed to be from the controller

192
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
and the most they traveled was to this

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
level two and there were no switches

194
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,479
back in the day because this was not

195
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,240
ethernet this was not

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,400
the regular i.t protocols that we're

197
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,319
familiar with these were all proprietary

198
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
at the time so there were some

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
connections but most of the data was

200
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
limited to this so

201
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,479
the level two and above were

202
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
disconnected meaning if you were in the

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,840
plant and your email let's say in the

204
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,120
1990s you had email obviously at the

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
corporate level you had other systems

206
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,599
managing inventory

207
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
looking for billing things like that

208
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,520
those were disconnected from this

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
process network so while air gap is a

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
technical military term they applied

211
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,800
that in ot saying hey this section is

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
disconnected from the rest of the it

213
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
network so let's call it air gap that

214
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
kind of made sense right

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,919
and because of that the uh the risk to

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
the ot network or the risk from the ot

217
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
network to it vice versa both of them

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,479
was limited because you were not

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,479
physically connected these things were

220
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
not connected to the id network

221
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
now in this newer model um where

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,280
everything is connected everywhere

223
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,879
there's a reason and purpose for that

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,919
right

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,880
because the data here is rich is useful

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
is beneficial for a lot of things it

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,640
started being connected to the it

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
network so in this reference base case

229
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
model what they're saying is you have

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,640
a dmz where you terminate things from

231
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
the internet and then you separately

232
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
authorize and authenticate

233
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
data coming from ot because most of

234
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,480
these ot

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
networks have obsolete systems and patch

236
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,959
systems uh unsupported systems so this

237
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
architecture if you build it a certain

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
way if you build it with security in

239
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,279
mind you would have a dmz and you'll

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
have firewalls with specific rules to

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
allow for specific access

242
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,519
specific type of access specific

243
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
protocols

244
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
all that

245
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,240
is in theory right so this purdue model

246
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
is in theory how it would work even if

247
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,360
you have an ot network that's you know

248
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
fairly insecure

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,480
so

250
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
that's the concept and again the reason

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
for connectivity is you have production

252
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
systems you have inventory management

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,519
you have billing if you're a pipeline

254
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,440
company for example that want to know

255
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,680
what product is actually in the pipe

256
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,360
right now and how much you're billing

257
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,080
your end user that information is at

258
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
this level zero so for that information

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,680
um to be used for billing or to be used

260
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
for something else for inventory

261
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
management or for bidding on the next

262
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
megawatt you need that information in

263
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
your it systems so how do you get there

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
is to have some kind of implementation

265
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,480
like this where you have firewalls in

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
place you have routing you then have a

267
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
dmz where you terminate the connection

268
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
and then have someone else from it from

269
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,040
internet access

270
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
get to the dmc and collect the

271
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
information that's the idea anyway okay

272
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
however

273
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
things that break the purdue model so by

274
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
design if you have an iot device whether

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,440
it's a audio or video recording device

276
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
including drones that are used these

277
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,040
days to collect information for example

278
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,360
if you want to inspect a top of a stack

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
for example you send a drone up there

280
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
and that drone is collecting information

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
about the status of what it's

282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
visualizing but it might also have a 4g

283
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
or a 5g model right

284
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,839
or if you have smart sensors for data

285
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,680
collection now if you have a pipeline

286
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,600
pick that's collecting information while

287
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
traveling through the pipeline or if you

288
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
have other sensors that collect

289
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
information about the weather because

290
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,839
that's what you're using in your process

291
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,880
if you're a transmission distribution

292
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
company this weather related sensor is

293
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
important because you might want to

294
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
dispatch

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
people or personnel in advance where

296
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
you're expecting some kind of tree fall

297
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
right so that you can clear the shrubs

298
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,279
have less of an outage window or if you

299
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
have other barcode readers or any of the

300
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
other iot devices that are proliferating

301
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
everywhere for good reason

302
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
they have these modems built in so that

303
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
breaks the purdue model because now all

304
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
the data is not strictly going into

305
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,920
level 0 to level 2 but it's directly

306
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,600
connected to the internet

307
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,640
same thing with plcs we have now plcs

308
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,519
available with web server and 5g modems

309
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,560
built in

310
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
which completely breaks the purdue model

311
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
because now the level 1 device is

312
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,240
directly able to access the internet

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
and then by dependencies right so if you

314
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,279
have a vendor that you need support with

315
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,440
on some operation of your gas turbine

316
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,079
for example and they need to be able to

317
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,560
log into your hmi the human machine

318
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
interface to be able to help you

319
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
troubleshoot or maybe optimize some of

320
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
the operation they typically have some

321
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
kind of remote access to your hmi now

322
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,160
you can do it properly securely through

323
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,279
the dmz or like in most cases the vendor

324
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,200
has only you know one tested way of

325
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
doing it and that's a direct connection

326
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
to the user interface

327
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
and then in other cases by practice or

328
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
by errors right so maintenance personnel

329
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
as accessing the engineering workstation

330
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
from the office network happens all the

331
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
time so they bridged without the dmz

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
directly their level 5 network to the

333
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,200
level 2 engineering workstation or maybe

334
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,120
some other process optimization inputs

335
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
that have direct access to the hmi again

336
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,880
this happens because you're trying to

337
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,120
optimize something with information that

338
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
you have in level four or level five and

339
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
you now have direct access to

340
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,519
the level two in the model

341
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,760
and then billing and erp systems that

342
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
are able to write to the hmi as opposed

343
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
to only reading right because if you

344
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
have a firewall and

345
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
it's all based on rules right so you

346
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
might have a bad rule that then says you

347
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,760
know not just reading but also enabling

348
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,639
write

349
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
similarly undocumented external

350
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,720
connections this happens all the time if

351
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
an operator connects a cell phone to

352
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
charge and on the hmi suddenly has

353
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
created a bypass

354
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
to the hdmi right and then misconfigured

355
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
firewalls we talked about one before

356
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
misconfigure routers happens all the

357
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
time in my line of work i see this all

358
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
the time where people think they have no

359
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,200
connections they say oh yeah we're air

360
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
gapped we're disconnected and next thing

361
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,279
you know you do a passive ingestion of

362
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
packets on the network you realize

363
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
they've had so many external connections

364
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
that were not documented so

365
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,920
by

366
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
all these problems the purdue model is

367
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
broke right so the theoretical model

368
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
never was true in the first place but

369
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
even if you had this idea that you have

370
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
this plan built in with the purdue model

371
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
in place it's still broken because of

372
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,040
all these things

373
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,079
next up

374
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
industry trends right so these are the

375
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
other aspects of you know the cloud is

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
here to stay peace so digital

377
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,079
transformation cloud analytics we all

378
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
know in our i.t world we know how much

379
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
of a benefit we got from these cloud

380
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
analytics projects right same thing in

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
the ot side a lot of end users are

382
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
leveraging these transformation projects

383
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
to connect more things so you need more

384
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,360
data means more connectivity and then

385
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
significantly faster and inexpensive

386
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,480
projects leveraging iot so if you were

387
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
to connect the sensor in the traditional

388
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
way right lay new cable lay new hubs lay

389
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,800
new everything just to get a piece of

390
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
information from a remote tank farm onto

391
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
the you know level zero network to level

392
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,839
one to level two that sometimes costs

393
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
you millions of dollars versus putting a

394
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
sensor out there that has an iot

395
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,839
capability bring it to the cloud you're

396
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,760
just done with a couple thousand dollars

397
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,720
right so see significantly different

398
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,680
economies of scale leveraging iot

399
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
which means even more cloud application

400
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
in ot and then retiring experienced

401
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,680
professionals sometimes you hear this

402
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
thing oh in the past we were able to run

403
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,120
this in manual in the past we did not

404
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
need uh internet connectivity or even if

405
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,360
our i.t site is ransomware we can run ot

406
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
manually all that is is gone right so

407
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
the experienced professionals that could

408
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,279
do it manually

409
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,160
have retired or are retiring or the

410
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
tools that were in place the methods the

411
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
processes in place that were able to

412
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
cause this manual operation don't exist

413
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,959
anymore so you can't go back i mean this

414
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
is one of those things where the wine is

415
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,399
being uncorked you can't put the cork

416
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,600
back

417
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,519
and then risk analysis right it's

418
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,440
meaningless for organizations now that

419
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
cloud is here to stay to focus just on

420
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
i.t risk the business risk is the key

421
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,079
right at the end of the day you have to

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
figure out if the incident whatever that

423
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,120
might be

424
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
happened

425
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
and and happened to you know cause any

426
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
disruption to your primary business

427
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
objective it caused any production loss

428
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,480
yes or no that's the only

429
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
important piece right

430
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,399
um as far as the production is concerned

431
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,240
and then if there was any unacceptable

432
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
impact on personal health safety or

433
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,000
environment this has always been the

434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
case with ot right ot essentially every

435
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
time you think about ot and industrial

436
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
control system thinking personnel health

437
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,480
safety and environment so that hasn't

438
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,959
changed so if there's an impact that you

439
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
gotta look for risk analysis and risk

440
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,839
mitigation for that piece so clearly

441
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,639
ransomware affecting only i.t systems

442
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
and ot systems not under being attacked

443
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,199
that's just irrelevant the key thing is

444
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,199
to figure out if your business is at

445
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,839
risk because of this increasingly

446
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
applying cloud and iot in the ot space

447
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,279
and then actions right what you have to

448
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,120
do in ot is slightly different from what

449
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
you do in it in inot you have to still

450
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
identify all your assets

451
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,800
most ot places don't have asset

452
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
information asset inventory they don't

453
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,399
have a good asset management structure

454
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
in place you have to start there you

455
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
have to then assess your vulnerabilities

456
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
and then monitor the risk right over

457
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
time

458
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,279
detect any anomalies and detect any

459
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
threats in your environment and then

460
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,079
this is another key aspect in it you're

461
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
used to let's patch up things as long as

462
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,679
you're up to date you're in good you

463
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,119
know golden shape right but that's not

464
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,359
the case here in our case we not only

465
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
have to think about reducing likelihood

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
but also have to think about impact so

467
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
if something wrong would happen

468
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
how can you limit the worst case that

469
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,480
can happen so if you know of a furnace

470
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,559
that can go you know

471
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
boom in case of an ot impact you have to

472
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,799
figure out what other physical

473
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,559
boundaries or whatever physical ways you

474
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,039
can cut off fuel for example to limit

475
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,039
the impact right

476
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,240
i know we're

477
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
going slightly over so let me make it

478
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,559
quick on the last

479
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,039
slide here so final thoughts

480
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,400
all the things that i mentioned in the

481
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
previous slide about how cloud

482
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
connectivity analytics and everything is

483
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,520
here to stay and you can't undo it right

484
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,200
and how you start with the asset

485
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
discovery asset visualization all that

486
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
is step one i mean thankfully you know

487
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
that's a good good step like collect a

488
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,679
lot of information rich information for

489
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
you to use going forward but you still

490
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
have to go through these other steps you

491
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
have to still go through personnel

492
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
training right still leveraging industry

493
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,240
groups of one industry one vertical has

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
a main attack vector you know leverage

495
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
that for the others in the industry

496
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,640
establish a disaster recovery policy and

497
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
a recovery time objective and this is

498
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
crucial like if you're talking about

499
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
fire right so most of the ot

500
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
installations historically have had

501
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
great plans for fire but because fire is

502
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,039
something you don't really plan for

503
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,400
right you say hey in case of a fire

504
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,240
you know we throw all our resources at

505
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
it you know bring the community

506
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,039
resources bring the water bring the fire

507
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,520
personnel everybody but you don't plan

508
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
for rebuilding right away because that's

509
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
not how those extremities work whereas

510
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,919
in our world you have to build

511
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,440
resilience like you have to be able to

512
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
constantly adapt to say i'm expecting

513
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
this kind of cyber attack whether it's

514
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,960
ransomware or something else and how do

515
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,120
you get back up really quickly right for

516
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
that you have to do tabletop exercises

517
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
instant response exercises and then

518
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,320
obviously you can outsource every one of

519
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
your instant response um scenarios but

520
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
you have to have a retainer with someone

521
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,280
right you have to build your own

522
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
personnel but also have a retainer with

523
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
a third party and then once you have an

524
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,919
instant post instant management that's

525
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,240
crucial right think about a ransomware

526
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,760
situation some countries are making it

527
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
illegal to pay ransom and then unlike in

528
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
i.t right you can't just come back up

529
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,760
it's not like you can

530
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,960
um

531
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
re-flash an image or restart a container

532
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
like in our world you have to rebuild

533
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,799
everything from scratch which means that

534
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
sometimes even if the recovery key works

535
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
it might take months for you to come

536
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
back up so you have to have a recovery

537
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
time objective for coming back up in a

538
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
much quicker fashion right whatever is

539
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,679
applicable for your industry and for

540
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,400
your company so there's a lot more to

541
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
our ot world where cloud is increasingly

542
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,080
everywhere prevalent 100 percent right a

543
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,200
lot more iot for sure the air gap that

544
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
hasn't existed in more than two decades

545
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
people still keep talking about it so

546
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
when you hear that tell them air gap is

547
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,320
myth doesn't happen anymore and cloud is

548
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
here to stay

549
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
with that i will end and take any

550
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,159
questions
