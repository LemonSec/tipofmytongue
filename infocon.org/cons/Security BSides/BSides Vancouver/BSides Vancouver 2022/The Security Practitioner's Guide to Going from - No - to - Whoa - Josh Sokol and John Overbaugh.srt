i i mean i'm happy to kick it off hey

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
everybody i'm jeff stokel i am here to

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
talk to you guys today along with my

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
buddy john about the security

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
practitioner's guide to going from no to

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
whoa and the whole idea of this

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,160
presentation was we're going from no

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,559
because you're not on the same page to

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,480
whoa where we're starting to talk with

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,600
management and they're actually

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
understanding what we're saying um you

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
know leadership is

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,960
constantly telling us now as security

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
practitioners uh but it's because you

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
aren't communicating in their language

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
which is the language of business and

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
security issues are often seen by

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,879
practitioners as binary uh you know is

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,040
it an emergency will it happen won't

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
happen that kind of thing and so the

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,000
idea behind this presentation uh what

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
john and i are going to talk to you guys

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
today is how do we go from that state

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
where hey we're being told no all the

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
time to a state where management

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
actually looks at what we're doing as a

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
value add to the business uh and you

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,799
know we're in a much better position as

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
security practitioners because they're

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,759
actually listening to what we have to

45
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,439
say

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
that's right and to get started i'll

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
introduce myself briefly my name is john

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,520
overbaugh i'm the chief information

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,159
security officer for alpine software

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,280
group we're

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
sort of a private equity company that

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
purchases and runs a number of companies

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,119
in different verticals

54
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
i've been in information security since

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,680
2012 most of that time in healthcare

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
and

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,000
really have

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
had a lot of opportunity to

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
learn how to social engineer leadership

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
and that essentially is what we're going

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
to talk about today

62
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,159
awesome and i'm josh sokol i'm i used to

63
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,759
run the information security program for

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,399
a big 1.6 billion a year publicly trade

65
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
organization called national instruments

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,360
i did that for about a decade uh and

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,599
then eventually i moved into a role as

68
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
ceo and cesa simporis and uh simpers is

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
a free open source uh enterprise risk

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,720
management tool i actually

71
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
when i was working at ni my bb came to

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
me one day and she said josh i heard

73
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
about this risk management thing can you

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
figure it out for me i said yeah i can

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
do that i did a lot of research i came

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
across the nist 800-30 framework for

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
risk management i said this is what i

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
want my program to look like but the

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,319
piece i struggled with was the tool set

80
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
i started off using excel spreadsheets

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,519
quickly realized that they wouldn't

82
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,360
scale i used a homegrown lowest notes

83
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
database for a little bit and wasn't

84
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
dynamic enough and then i started

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,319
looking at the big grc suites that are

86
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
out there um eventually i got to the

87
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
point where i couldn't afford the big

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
grc suites the excel stuff wasn't going

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
to scale for me and so i ended up

90
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
writing something i ended up releasing

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
that thing that i wrote free and open

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,879
source for the security community uh and

93
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,519
that is simple as so today we're going

94
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,879
to talk to you guys a little bit more

95
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
about kind of what goes on behind the

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,159
scenes there we'll talk about the

97
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
management stuff and whatnot but before

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
we get into that let's talk about the

99
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
atlas cinder uh the atlas syndrome is

100
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,920
the no it's the the idea that we are

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
putting all this weight on our shoulders

102
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
so take a moment

103
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,239
think about all the security tools that

104
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
are currently seeing in your arsenal all

105
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,599
the different things that are out there

106
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,400
how many are there five ten is there

107
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
more than that

108
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
once you have that number in your head i

109
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
want you guys to think about

110
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
uh

111
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
the the alerts the things like that

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
they're coming from your nga v the evr

113
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,720
the firewalls the scene right

114
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,920
now in terms of those alerts uh sc media

115
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
did a survey back in 2018

116
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
and they said that 55 of enterprises see

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
more than 10 000 alerts per day and 27

118
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
saw more than a million alerts per day

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,599
that's a crazy number when you start to

120
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
think of it and maybe you guys are

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
seeing that same kind of thing and de

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
misto in 2018 did a state of sword

123
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
report where they said security teams

124
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
were were bombarded with a hundred and

125
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
seven

126
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
right

127
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,600
there we go

128
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
sorry i i was getting a different

129
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
presentation coming in over me i was

130
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,960
like this is super weird and i just

131
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
closed the process

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
um so uh that soar report basically said

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,360
that the security teams were bombarded

134
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
with 174 000 alerts per week um and

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
averaged about 25 000 per day so

136
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
regardless of the source we know that

137
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
our security teams are up against a

138
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
constant barrage of alerts

139
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
now since we know about all these

140
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
different alerts uh when i was at ni we

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
had about a hundred thousand

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
vulnerabilities that were found by our

143
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
skin and all those different

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
vulnerabilities that were found were

145
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
waiting to be triaged so

146
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,759
if you think about it this was me

147
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
every platform that i learned every

148
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
vulnerability that was found these were

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
my burdens to bear and in short

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
this was me i i'd have panic attacks

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
thinking about all the what-if scenarios

152
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
i sometimes had trouble sleeping at

153
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
night thinking about which would be the

154
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
nail in my coffin

155
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,639
can any of you guys relate to this john

156
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
do you relate to this

157
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
absolutely i mean josh having been in

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
information security for over over 10

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
years now this is what we deal with day

160
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
in and day out is that heavy weight on

161
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,120
our shoulders of knowing

162
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,680
everything that's going wrong knowing

163
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
where all the skeletons are knowing

164
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
what's going bump in the night and it is

165
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
it literally can be physically taxing

166
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
like no joke but also it's something

167
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
that hampers us in our performance in

168
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
our professional advancement

169
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,280
and and the success that we have in work

170
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
if we don't figure out how to manage it

171
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
and get through it

172
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
absolutely

173
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,720
no

174
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
i'm guessing the rest of you guys feel

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,400
that same way as well and what we're

176
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
going to talk about today is kind of

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,360
what we do about that john's going to

178
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
cover that a little bit more the other

179
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,039
issue that we run into the thing that we

180
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
see very frequently is what we call the

181
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,479
chicken little effect

182
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,319
and we see practitioners going this

183
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,720
route all the time the idea here is that

184
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
with every new issue discovered the sky

185
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
is falling right every issue that we

186
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
find is the worst issue possible there's

187
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
no prioritization there's no way to

188
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,919
discern which thing is the most

189
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
important thing to work on and ends up

190
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
becoming a constant distraction from

191
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,639
work which pays the bills right and

192
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
that's a big issue there

193
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,360
so what happens all right well what if i

194
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,319
told you

195
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
that eventually management is going to

196
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,560
start to ignore you you're going to get

197
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,800
used to hearing the word no right over

198
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
and over again because you're now seeing

199
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
you're being seen as an inhibitor to the

200
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
business

201
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,759
so

202
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
this is your last chance

203
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
after this there's no turning back you

204
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
can take this blue pill and the story

205
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,039
ends you guys can go back to work you

206
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
can continue to feel like atlas you can

207
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
bemoan your fellow security

208
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,319
practitioners about how you're

209
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,880
constantly be being told no

210
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,759
or

211
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,440
you can take the red pill you can stay

212
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,400
in wonderland

213
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
john and i are going to show you how

214
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
deep this rabbit hole goes and remember

215
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,759
what we're offering here is the truth

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,919
and nothing more right very matrixy but

217
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
you get the idea you can pick that red

218
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
pill you're going to go back to the same

219
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,280
old way the same binary approach the

220
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,919
same atlas syndrome or you can listen to

221
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
us and find a new way to approach it

222
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,520
which is the non-binary way and so i'm

223
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
going to let john kind take it from here

224
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,240
sure thing say thanks josh so

225
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
we're we're presenting an alternative

226
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,880
approach instead of the chicken little

227
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,599
atlas syndrome approach we're pretty

228
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
presenting a new approach to information

229
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
security management the foundation of

230
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
that is an entirely new perspective that

231
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
security leadership's responsibility

232
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,160
really is to define assess and

233
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,039
contextualize while reporting

234
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
so the key here is that we have to

235
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
understand our role as security

236
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,879
practitioners and most important in

237
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
understanding that role is that we are

238
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,560
not the risk owners

239
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
we are risk discoverers and we help

240
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
teams to understand and respond to or

241
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,039
treat

242
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,879
that risk so let's jump ahead one more

243
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
slide here and we want to talk about how

244
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,080
we do that well

245
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
look our companies trust us to conduct

246
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
risk assessments or maybe the better

247
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
word is they interest us to conduct risk

248
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,599
assessments

249
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,240
we start by proposing and working for

250
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
agreement on a list of controls or on a

251
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,800
control framework and then we analyze

252
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
against those frameworks

253
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,599
when

254
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,759
we're there to serve the business and to

255
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
support them in improving security by

256
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
helping them ensure they're adhering in

257
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
our compliance to those frameworks to

258
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,958
accomplish all of this our program has

259
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,200
to be written down and approved by

260
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
senior management

261
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,159
now there's an interesting kind of side

262
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
conversation that you and i had here

263
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
john which is this idea of auditors

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
right that now that we've

265
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
got our framework the auditors are going

266
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
to come in they're going to say hey you

267
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
know these are the things that you

268
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
should do and i i had this happen to me

269
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,920
when i was at ni where they said hey um

270
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
here's the checklist do you do this and

271
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
i'd say yes check that off and then

272
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
they'd say do you do this and they i'd

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
be like no and they'd check that off

274
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
right yeah and i ended up writing a blog

275
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
post about this that called auditors

276
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
don't understand security the whole idea

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
is that this checklist approach to risk

278
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
management just doesn't work right the

279
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
idea of risk assessment via checklist

280
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
what are your thoughts on that well

281
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
that's that's a good question i want to

282
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
actually drill down a little further

283
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
into this risk management framework and

284
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
talk more about it and by the way this

285
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
risk management framework should not be

286
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,600
new to anyone this is what we do all day

287
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
long and it's a more visual way of

288
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
looking at what we do as leaders

289
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
we run parts of the company through a

290
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
traditional risk management framework or

291
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
a process

292
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
what's important in all of this is that

293
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
the new phase i've added on there the

294
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,279
document phase right it's important to

295
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,600
provide a clear definition of done for a

296
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,120
given control

297
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
otherwise the business runs out of

298
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
patience with us or because the

299
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
definition of done is not clear they

300
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,959
always say yeah yeah we've got that

301
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
we've got that so our program can either

302
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,399
be

303
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,320
unclear and frustrating to our business

304
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
customers or our program can be

305
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
ineffective a paper tiger at best

306
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
so by having this solid framework where

307
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,839
we document our controls and then we

308
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
assess prioritize plan and tractor

309
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
remediation vulnerabilities this is a

310
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,160
better approach to um to

311
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,680
to completing that cycle now josh i want

312
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,440
you to tell me a little story about

313
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,920
about the last time you did a road

314
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,880
mapping exercise yeah absolutely so you

315
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
know back when i worked at national

316
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
instruments uh my management kept coming

317
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
to me and they said josh when is this

318
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
going to be done when are you done when

319
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
does security stop

320
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,079
and you know the the funny thing about

321
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,680
this is we all know security

322
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
practitioners it never stops right

323
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
there's always the goal posts are

324
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,920
constantly moving uh because our threats

325
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
our adversaries are constantly changing

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,640
their approach um so i did this exercise

327
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
i took the nist cyber security framework

328
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,000
and went through it and for each

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,760
individual item in there i said this is

330
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
where we're at today and this is where i

331
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
want to get to basically

332
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
you know a an assessment of our state

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
and what we looked at for that was the

334
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,240
difference between that um you know if

335
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
there was a big gap that's a big risk if

336
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
it's a small gap it's a small risk but

337
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
at the end of the day we were able to

338
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
basically take this uh exercise that we

339
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
did and turn it into a road map for our

340
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
organization we could say that hey if i

341
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
bridge this gap now we're in the place

342
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
that we need to be in order to to move

343
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
our organization forward

344
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,920
and the key is to get to that bar josh

345
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
like you said right so

346
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
there's there's an assessment of where

347
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,399
we are today

348
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
versus where we want to be

349
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
and what's important is making sure that

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
senior management is on board with where

351
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
we want to be

352
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
once we have agreement there

353
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,839
then we can define those gaps we're not

354
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,279
the owners of those gaps we're not the

355
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,519
bad guys that are bringing bad news our

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,079
job is to observe and we can now answer

357
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
that question when does this stop well

358
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
it stops when we meet the bar that was

359
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
set by leadership which leadership

360
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,959
approved

361
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,360
then we we go to work on it now the key

362
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
is that we work with leadership we start

363
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
because we're security experts we're the

364
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,040
ones that really know what what the

365
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
right controls are so we'll sit down

366
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
come up with those controls propose them

367
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
to senior leadership help them

368
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
understand the pros and cons of either

369
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
meeting or deviating from that

370
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,399
particular control and eventually we

371
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,399
reach that conclusion so part of our job

372
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,720
here is to build consensus

373
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
now

374
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,279
go ahead josh do you have something you

375
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,480
want to say

376
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,839
i was just going to say you know one

377
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
thing that i wanted to key in on there

378
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,519
is what you said this is a proposal

379
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,440
we're telling management right this is

380
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
what we'd like to see

381
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,639
but we're not deciding as security

382
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
practitioners we're not the decision

383
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,160
makers because we all know the people

384
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
the budget things like that yeah that's

385
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
right yeah as i mean as a ciso for

386
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
instance my job is very different from

387
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
what it was you know 10 10 years ago as

388
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
a director of security today my job is

389
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
to sit with senior leaders in the

390
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,440
company and talk from a strategic

391
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,360
perspective about risk

392
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,959
talk about what the appropriate control

393
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,880
frameworks might look like and talk

394
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,480
about the business problems that we're

395
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
facing that might prevent us from

396
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
implementing those so it is very much a

397
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
conversation that we have to have at the

398
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,079
leadership level

399
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,200
now josh you know i get asked a lot um

400
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,079
either within my organizations but often

401
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,320
uh uh outside of organizations by by the

402
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
way i'm really active on linkedin um you

403
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
can follow me there or uh you know

404
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,000
connect with me i'm also pretty active

405
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
on reddit um a little more anonymously

406
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
but still same idea i talk a lot about

407
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,920
leadership and about security and one of

408
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
the controversial things i always tell

409
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,800
people is i don't care if you have

410
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
policies or procedures in place i want

411
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,639
to see an incident response plan first

412
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,160
and there are a lot of people who say no

413
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079
no you can't do that you have to have a

414
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,800
policy to dictate your procedure or you

415
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
can't move forward right so some people

416
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
really assert that we have to have

417
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
policy and procedure first others say we

418
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,399
have to have controls and it's an

419
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,079
age-old argument but what's interesting

420
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,320
about this argument is it's actually a

421
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
trick question right um we need policy

422
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
and procedure we need controls pretty

423
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
much at the same time if you want to pop

424
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,120
to the next slide josh pretty much at

425
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,760
the same time and as we develop one it

426
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
will feed off the other and we'll be

427
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
going back and forth oh sorry i skipped

428
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,920
a head one didn't i um we'll be uh we'll

429
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,639
be we'll be flipping back and forth so

430
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,160
just in this approach where we're

431
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
talking about you know we want to go to

432
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
senior leadership with a control set

433
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
well we have to have a policy first

434
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,920
they're going to inform one another

435
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,199
you're going to write these together if

436
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
they don't exist today you're going to

437
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
modify them together if they are in

438
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
place today that's the important thing

439
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
so both of them come first

440
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
and so the real question here is

441
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
what is our responsibility so really to

442
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
summarize what we're talking about

443
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
senior leadership's responsibility rests

444
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,639
in identifying and communicating

445
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,120
where the risk is that is what a strong

446
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
risk management program does and then we

447
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,519
define the associated processes to

448
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
correct that program

449
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
how do we track what decisions are being

450
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,959
made and who's making these decisions is

451
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
another thing we need to tackle

452
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
when we have that tackle what we're

453
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
doing now is we are we're setting a bar

454
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,680
we're identifying gaps between where we

455
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
are today and where that bar is

456
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,079
then we're we're sharing those gaps with

457
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,800
the actual owners of them

458
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
and then we're also collecting from them

459
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
their plan to remediate that all along

460
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,199
senior management is informed they

461
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
understand from a metrics perspective as

462
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
well as an anecdotal perspective where

463
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
we stand

464
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,920
the business

465
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,759
may start fighting us on this because

466
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,759
what we're doing is we're we're ridding

467
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,240
ourselves of the atlas syndrome we're

468
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,320
taking that big ball of responsibility

469
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
for the security work picking it up

470
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,480
dividing it and placing it on the

471
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
shoulders of the business owners who

472
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,519
have agreed to the

473
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,279
agreed to the controls but have the

474
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,120
control gaps and are responsible for the

475
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,519
remediation by the way the business

476
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,959
might really fight you the first time

477
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
you try to document their decision not

478
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,480
not to fix something

479
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
but that's okay

480
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,759
those conversations are what we need to

481
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,600
have and i actually want to talk briefly

482
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
about that what if they say no

483
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,759
so

484
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,880
i want to put in your mind this idea

485
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
that we don't have all of the context of

486
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,959
what's going on in the business we don't

487
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,320
understand everything around what our

488
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
executives are making and the issues

489
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,759
that they're facing and honestly

490
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,199
sometimes it's probably better not to

491
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,320
know

492
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
it's not that leaders don't value

493
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
security although i will admit there are

494
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
some who do not but rather that in the

495
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
context of everything else

496
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
that information security vulnerability

497
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,160
we're talking about that may not be the

498
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
priority

499
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
right so for instance as a startup

500
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
company we may be so

501
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
so small and have such small revenue

502
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
that the decision is either we add new

503
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,920
features gain new revenue or we go out

504
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
of business and we don't really have the

505
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,360
luxury of addressing some of that

506
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
security stuff we have to take a risk

507
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,959
because otherwise

508
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,560
we're threatening the very existence of

509
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,600
the company

510
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,000
this is where you as the security leader

511
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,760
really define yourself

512
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
you can complain or whine and say my you

513
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,559
know my cso is an idiot my ceo is a jerk

514
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,240
whatever you want to say or you can

515
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
accept the answer

516
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
and come up with an alternative that

517
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
might help compensate or mitigate the

518
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,520
risk and it may not be a full mitigation

519
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
but it might help to reduce the risk to

520
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,319
an acceptable level the key takeaway i

521
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
want you to have here is that no is not

522
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
a terminus it's a junction

523
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,360
the successful leaders in business today

524
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
in information security are those who

525
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
look at noah as an opportunity to get to

526
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,559
yes

527
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,760
that is the most important

528
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,679
characteristic we can have

529
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,880
now

530
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
we want to be able to take all of this

531
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,559
information and bring it together and

532
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,240
get to yes on the right things we want

533
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
to be able to filter our highest risks

534
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
to the top so we can have good effective

535
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
conversations about those and

536
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
and deal with those

537
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
sooner the challenge is how do we do

538
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
that how do we bring all of our risks

539
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,360
together

540
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
how do we understand what appropriate

541
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
mitigations are for those risks how do

542
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,440
we document the decisions that we have

543
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
made and how do we ensure that senior

544
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
management is buying off on those

545
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
decisions and we can literally prove

546
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,320
that they made that decision well

547
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
now we need tools and as josh pointed

548
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
out earlier probably the tools we have

549
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,799
today aren't enough so josh i want you

550
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,919
to take a few minutes and talk more

551
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,200
about that

552
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,320
yeah absolutely um so when it comes to

553
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,760
tools for uh risk management um you know

554
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
we need good tools uh that enable

555
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,919
information security leadership by

556
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
creating a strong governance foundation

557
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,039
we need those frameworks that john

558
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,520
talked about we need to develop a strong

559
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
risk management process something that's

560
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,919
easy to understand something that's easy

561
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
to follow identifying and communicating

562
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
this risk is where the strong risk

563
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
management program the associated

564
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,160
processes come into play and so this is

565
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,559
how we end up getting rid of that atlas

566
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,440
syndrome um additionally enforcing

567
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
separate roles for risk assessment

568
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
conveyancing acceptance and then you

569
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,200
know lastly enabling the business to

570
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
make informed risk-based decisions and

571
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,039
that really is going to be the key thing

572
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,600
here our business is the ones making the

573
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,960
the decisions and that's going to be a

574
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
theme kind throughout this presentation

575
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,799
now

576
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,240
have you guys ever seen a spreadsheet

577
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,360
like this these are my favorites

578
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
oh yeah i mean i i lived these when i

579
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,919
was at ni i've seen dozens of templates

580
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,280
like this

581
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
online you know if you search risk

582
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,679
management template this is what you

583
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
come back with and so you know i've

584
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,559
lived this the issue with templates

585
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,200
though or spreadsheets um is

586
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
this you know you you can try doing risk

587
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,799
management excel it's generally

588
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
available to you there's no additional

589
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
cost but it comes with a lot of

590
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,919
challenges the first one here is

591
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
spreadsheets don't scale you know you

592
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
have a spreadsheet with a dozen risks

593
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
for a single team it might be manageable

594
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
but one with hundreds or thousands of

595
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
risks across multiple teams it just

596
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
becomes unwieldy um having multiple

597
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,480
people editing the same spreadsheet uh

598
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
at the same time that's a recipe for

599
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
disaster and worse how do you maintain

600
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
an enterprise approach to risk

601
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
management while ensuring that one team

602
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,240
doesn't see another team's risk

603
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
the second one here is a spreadsheet

604
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,400
just isn't a database right you can do

605
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
pivot tables in excel you can use fancy

606
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,799
formulas but joining data from distinct

607
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,799
tables is difficult if not impossible to

608
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,760
do in an excel spreadsheet uh

609
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
in something like sim course database

610
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,280
queries can sometimes span a dozen or

611
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,520
more tables which takes a fraction

612
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,679
fraction of a second uh when it comes to

613
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
a database uh there's simply no

614
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,360
substitute for the efficiency and scale

615
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
of a database when you're joining

616
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
multiple distinct sets of data

617
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
um and then the last one here

618
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,720
spreadsheets require maintenance um

619
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,039
anybody who tells you otherwise is just

620
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,640
you know flat out wrong or they haven't

621
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,799
used a spreadsheet um those who fall

622
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,000
into the spreadsheet-based first

623
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,679
approach to risk management they'll

624
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,360
typically spend just as much time

625
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
tweaking their spreadsheet and messing

626
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
around with their formulas as they do

627
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,039
actually managing risk and remember

628
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,720
again i started out doing risk

629
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,640
management with spreadsheets right i've

630
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
been there um each new report is going

631
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,559
to require a substantial investment of

632
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,400
time to create and it really just ends

633
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,919
up being a waste of resources that are

634
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,400
far better utilized elsewhere in your

635
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
organization

636
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
now once i realized that my spreadsheets

637
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
wouldn't work i used a homegrown lowest

638
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,240
notes database to do risk management

639
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
you can do this you can do a diy

640
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,799
approach try and write yourself um you

641
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,640
end up spending countless wasted hours

642
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,960
on development instead of doing risk

643
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
management which is what we're trying to

644
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
do and you know when the reality is is

645
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
that most of us risk management is this

646
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,120
much of our overall responsibility and

647
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
we've got so much else i would play if

648
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
you're spending that time trying to

649
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
write a tool

650
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,760
maybe it's not spent in the best place

651
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
um especially if you're not a developer

652
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
man you got problems there

653
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,120
um

654
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
so yeah john tell us about the ideal

655
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
solution well you know so what's

656
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,559
interesting is the first half of my

657
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,720
career i spent in product groups

658
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,039
building software at microsoft

659
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,440
and uh was very familiar with the tools

660
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,760
that we used internally to identify

661
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,720
track and remediate bugs defects in our

662
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,919
software

663
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
then you know fast forward i'm in

664
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,039
information security and um both as a

665
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,919
practitioner as a director um in over

666
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,840
multiple groups and then also as a

667
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
consultant with numerous customers all i

668
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
had in my hands was was an excel

669
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,720
spreadsheet and you know

670
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
i just didn't have the tool set that i

671
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,080
needed to get the job done i needed to

672
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,320
be just as effective at managing

673
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,039
thousands of risks across multiple teams

674
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,760
as i would be with 10 risks i also

675
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,880
needed to

676
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
allow multiple people to work in in my

677
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,919
solution and in fact my first role as a

678
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,240
v as a vice president as a vp

679
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,320
i had i had seven members on my team and

680
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,760
they were all responsible for

681
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
identifying risks and the spreadsheets

682
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,760
that we had just weren't keeping up with

683
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,080
it finally i needed to be able to report

684
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
easily across multiple data sets for

685
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
different customers and i needed to be

686
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,720
able to spend my time

687
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
um working on risk not on the tool i

688
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
like to tell my teams all the time that

689
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,039
look the tool is there for us we're not

690
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
there for the tool

691
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,200
uh and so you know um and we don't want

692
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
this to sound like it's a sales pitch

693
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
but i was thrilled to come across simple

694
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
risks so as josh mentioned

695
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
i started looking for risk management

696
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,240
grc tools grc solutions they're very

697
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,400
high priced they take a long time to

698
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,679
stand up

699
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,559
and

700
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,640
they they require a pretty heavy uh

701
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,760
commitment

702
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,840
we on on one of my teams stumbled across

703
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
simple risk and i thought it might have

704
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,679
be too good to be true so first of all

705
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,679
it was free and open source if i wanted

706
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
um there was also a paid commercial

707
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,120
version of it

708
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
and so you know what really helped me

709
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,279
was finding this solution playing with a

710
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,360
little bit uh just doing some scenarios

711
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,279
and realizing holy cow i can bring all

712
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
my risks in one place i can start to

713
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
propose solutions to those risks i can

714
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,440
track agreement on whether or not the

715
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
solutions will be accepted and i can

716
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,080
track that risk to completion so today

717
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,520
what we're going to do is we're going to

718
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,360
walk through the risk management process

719
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,120
we're actually going to do it real time

720
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
we're going to use simple risk not

721
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
because we're trying to sell it to you

722
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,840
it's free but because it does a great

723
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,159
job of demonstrating all of the phases

724
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
of risk management and again in the end

725
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,240
what we're trying to do here is take

726
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,000
responsibility for fixing

727
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
vulnerabilities off of our shoulders and

728
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
placing it upon the shoulders of the

729
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,080
business owners the people who actually

730
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,799
can fix the risk so let's let's dive in

731
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,039
here josh and let's walk through it

732
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
yeah absolutely so

733
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,480
the first piece that we talked about was

734
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,919
creating this strong governance

735
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,200
foundation through the control

736
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,919
frameworks and even in simplest core

737
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,360
there's kind of two different ways to go

738
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
about doing this you can manually add

739
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,799
your own frameworks manually add your

740
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,840
controls into there um but my personal

741
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,279
preference is leveraging what's called

742
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,960
the compliance forge secure controls

743
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,039
framework uh this is a free thing you

744
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,840
can download from

745
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,679
securecontrolsframework.com

746
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,200
uh they'll give it to you as an excel

747
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
spreadsheet but what they've done is

748
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
they've taken about a thousand uh

749
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,440
security and privacy related controls

750
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,360
and they've mapped them across 185

751
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,520
different frameworks so things like nist

752
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,200
oh so pci dss hipaa gdpr

753
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,559
you name it all these different

754
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,799
frameworks are all mapped in here and

755
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,320
what you end up getting with this is

756
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,480
kind of this uh if you're a fan of lord

757
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
of the rings like the one ring to rule

758
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
them all approach you you basically have

759
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,279
like this one control set but it applies

760
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,679
across the board and the huge advantage

761
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,200
to this is when it comes to your

762
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,480
compliance when it comes to actually

763
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
testing these controls you test the

764
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
control once and it applies in all those

765
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
different locations so that mapping is

766
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,120
huge

767
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,240
um yep

768
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,840
this is this is what i love if i can

769
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
interrupt briefly this is what i love

770
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,159
about having a control set and the

771
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,919
ability to map controls to various

772
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
frameworks it allows me to customize my

773
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,039
controls for my organizations uh the

774
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,120
company i work for we own 45 different

775
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,799
companies we have very different

776
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,559
security needs at each company some of

777
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,240
them are in behavioral health which

778
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
means they're

779
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,159
under the united states hipaa laws some

780
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,440
of them are um under pci and other data

781
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,760
data protection laws but what's what's

782
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
important here is i have a common set of

783
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,720
controls mapped to different frameworks

784
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
what also helps me is i can map controls

785
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,000
to my customer contractual commitments

786
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,559
so josh like you said i may have

787
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
i may be in a hipaa regulated

788
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
environment i might have 15 customers

789
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
that give me

790
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
a very definitive list of security

791
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,480
controls that i have to have in place

792
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
what i can do is map all of those to my

793
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
existing control framework then i audit

794
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,679
once and i can report multiple times

795
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,799
that's right

796
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,799
yeah um the other interesting thing here

797
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
and this kind of drives back to what we

798
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,159
were talking about with the

799
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,039
um the csf exercise that i did where i

800
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
said here's where i'm at today here's

801
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
where i want to get to is we can use any

802
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,760
control framework really to do the same

803
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
kind of exercise so we can say you know

804
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,600
with this example this is gogo one and

805
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,279
compliance forge you know my current

806
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,279
level of maturity is performed my

807
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,760
desired state is managed and so now we

808
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
have that gap and within simphours we

809
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,840
can go uh there's a cool report called

810
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,640
the control gap analysis report um that

811
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,200
i built based on the what i presented to

812
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
my management um and it's gonna show me

813
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
it's gonna show me here's where i'm at

814
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
today here's where i wanna get to with

815
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,640
each of those different control families

816
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
so i can see i'm doing well at asset

817
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,559
management i'm not doing very well at uh

818
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,200
secure engineering and architecture

819
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
and you know josh there's one thing i

820
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,159
really like about this graph and first

821
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,440
of all we're all going to have a little

822
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,679
laugh about this right because we all

823
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
know that executives want pictures and

824
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
you know i used to joke about it but

825
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
actually honestly there's no better way

826
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,200
to communicate the status of

827
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
250 control sets than a graph like this

828
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
so the key on this graph is that the

829
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
black line

830
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,360
is the predefined agreed upon maturity

831
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,919
level that we want to reach as a company

832
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,159
we've selected these controls in each of

833
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,080
these areas and said

834
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,919
senior leadership says this is where we

835
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,399
need to be the blue line shows where we

836
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,640
actually are today i can put this

837
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,960
control down in front of a ceo and

838
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
within about 10 seconds that ceo

839
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,200
understands i need to make investments

840
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,559
here and i'm cruising well here

841
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,960
yeah and to put in the language that you

842
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,880
used earlier it's the bar right the

843
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
black line the desired state is the bar

844
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,840
that we've agreed upon to me and so in

845
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,279
any of these areas where i'm not meeting

846
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
that bar that means that we have

847
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
something explained to do this is what

848
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,279
we're going to do to guess that point

849
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,799
and when we're not meeting that bar

850
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,960
that's what we call risks

851
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
and we want to go through a common risk

852
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,799
management framework and the one that

853
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
you've developed in simple risk is based

854
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
on the nist 830 framework so josh why

855
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,880
don't you walk us through that a little

856
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
bit yeah that's absolutely right so you

857
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
know the second item that we talked

858
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,240
about was developing that strong risk

859
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,159
management process but i think the more

860
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,600
important thing here is that it needs to

861
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,159
be easy to understand and follow um the

862
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,000
reality is is that you know a lot of the

863
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,440
people who are going to be entering

864
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,679
risks in your organization

865
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,360
they're not risk practitioners they're

866
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,919
not risk experts they're the use guy who

867
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,120
discovered a unencrypted ssh key while

868
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
messing around on a system right those

869
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
are the people who are going to be

870
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,399
interacting with this so you know the

871
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,480
process that miss gives us is pretty

872
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,399
simple it says hey you need to be able

873
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,240
to spit your risk keep a registry of all

874
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,840
the risks in the organization

875
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,679
talks about plan mitigations what are we

876
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,520
going to do to address these risks john

877
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
you and i had a conversation earlier

878
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
that maybe we should change that to

879
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
treatment because

880
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
we're not necessarily going to mitigate

881
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,000
everything right we might transfer the

882
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,840
race we might decide to research or to

883
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,960
watch uh the next step is the accepting

884
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
the mitigation so this is where we start

885
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,039
to look at hey this person said we

886
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,039
should do this yeah that sounds good

887
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,640
let's go ahead and do that

888
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
and then in my opinion the most

889
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
important piece here is going to be the

890
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,240
management review this is the piece that

891
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
gets the weight of the world off of your

892
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,559
shoulders as the security guy this is

893
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,640
where we say hey management

894
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
here's the risk these are all the risks

895
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,799
in our registry here's what we think

896
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
that we should do about it

897
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,559
do you agree is this the bar that we

898
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,159
want to hold ourselves to and when

899
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,200
management says yes we should cool they

900
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,520
are now empowering us to make these

901
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,679
make these changes right it might not be

902
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,120
us making those changes it's the

903
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,200
business that's doing this uh if they

904
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,760
say no if they say no we're not willing

905
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,919
to do this then like john talked about

906
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,320
earlier we might lack the context we

907
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,840
don't know that the business has you

908
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
know a thousand dollars left in the bank

909
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
and can't make payroll this month right

910
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,399
there may be some very valid reasons why

911
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,480
they're making this decision not to

912
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,520
it's not our place to question that but

913
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
it is our place to make sure that

914
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,320
decision is documented uh because that's

915
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
what gets that monkey off of our back

916
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
and then the last piece here is the

917
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,159
review regularly so risk management is a

918
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,760
cyclical process we don't just do it

919
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
once and forget about it uh we need to

920
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
make sure that we're re-reviewing our

921
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
regular basis because frankly risk

922
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,760
changes you know you have a cve that's

923
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
introduced uh well let's start off with

924
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,320
an oday that was introduced a week ago

925
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
right that oday is huge it's uh

926
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
somebody's automated it's compromising

927
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,760
systems uh all of a sudden we have a cve

928
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
we have a patch in place the risk goes

929
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
down right so risk is constantly

930
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
changing and we need to reevaluate those

931
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,760
risks in order to do that yep yep

932
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
now one of the things i love about using

933
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,679
a tool like simple risk

934
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,159
is uh well let's step back if you

935
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,720
consider tracking risks in excel how do

936
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,960
you do it you have a you have an excel

937
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,919
uh ply a worksheet in a workbook and you

938
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,200
have columns for title and for owner and

939
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
so on and so forth and really not a lot

940
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,320
of context to help you fill it out

941
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,159
you could pre-populate some of the

942
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,919
columns by using you know a pick list

943
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,320
and so forth but that's just work to

944
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,279
build the worksheet so so what really

945
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,279
has helped kind of move the lever for me

946
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,080
and my experience using uh simple risk

947
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,720
is that now i can track risks just like

948
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,600
i use jira to track my defects and that

949
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,200
metaphor really um it it gels well with

950
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
our development team so a very simple

951
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,600
risk management workflow is something we

952
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,840
have to have it this system has to

953
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
present it to users in a simple and

954
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
intuitive way to allow users to submit

955
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,760
the risks themselves and you can see

956
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,559
here this tab that we're showing is how

957
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,039
i collect data about the risks across my

958
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
45 companies

959
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,640
um and you know i allow those

960
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
individuals and those companies to

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
create those risks what's really nice

962
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,760
about this is that there's there's a

963
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,519
framework in here for

964
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,919
rating your risk and you can use any

965
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,519
framework you're comfortable with if

966
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,360
it's dread if it's stride if it's the

967
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,440
common um you know impact times

968
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,080
likelihood if it's the owasp risk score

969
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,159
if it's a cvss you can pick whatever you

970
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,360
want to do

971
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,279
put it in here and as josh is going to

972
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,440
demonstrate in just a second that risk

973
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
score is normalized across all risks no

974
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
matter how the score has been entered

975
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
it's the same score across all risk

976
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,320
which allow you to compare risks with

977
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,760
one another so josh why don't you take

978
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,360
that that tab and talk a little bit more

979
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,320
about that

980
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,960
yeah absolutely so you know the idea is

981
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,480
that we're able to go and we're able to

982
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
say hey if this is the likelihood of an

983
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
issue and this is the impact here's the

984
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
risk score so we can use that kind of

985
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,760
classic risk methodology that you

986
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,799
learned on your cissp um but as john

987
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,080
said you know you've got things like

988
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,240
oauth first-rate methodology so if you

989
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
find a sql injection vulnerability you

990
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,679
might want to capture it that way uh if

991
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,960
you find the latest log for shell

992
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,159
vulnerability you might go through a

993
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,120
cvss corn because that's a cve that you

994
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
can capture so really this is just a

995
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
matter of documenting the decisions that

996
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,960
we're making and the process that we use

997
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
to get to that point no okay but josh

998
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,600
i'm gonna interrupt all right all right

999
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,799
this is not a 10. all right fair enough

1000
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,720
john this is how many times do i have to

1001
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,080
tell you not every risk is attended

1002
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,600
well you you've told me enough times for

1003
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
me to know better for sure um you know

1004
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,559
you're absolutely right so this risk

1005
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
right here it says that it's a 10. um

1006
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,440
but the interesting thing is that a 10

1007
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,159
uh is um it's subjective right if i am

1008
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,280
the

1009
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
information security person and this is

1010
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,480
a risk the system is going to get

1011
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,960
compromised in my world within my

1012
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,839
purview that's a 10. right but as soon

1013
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,760
as we go outside of my purview now we're

1014
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,199
talking i t

1015
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,440
is that still 10 that one system getting

1016
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,520
compromised is that still 10 probably

1017
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
not when we're talking the it realm of

1018
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,839
things it's probably my data center is

1019
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,159
offline that's probably a 10 in the it

1020
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
world okay but let's take a step back

1021
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,918
and let's say all right for the

1022
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,199
enterprise

1023
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,280
is the data center going offline is that

1024
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,480
the 10 or is it the fact that we we've

1025
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
lost all of our customers you know is

1026
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,960
that the real town or the fact that

1027
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,879
employee died right is that the town so

1028
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,720
when we're looking at these risks you're

1029
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,240
absolutely right john we have to keep

1030
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,839
the context uh in mind and we have to

1031
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,240
kind of baseline this and say is this a

1032
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,720
10 for me or is this the 10 for the

1033
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,000
enterprise

1034
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,599
and that's what's nice about the way we

1035
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,599
can enter risks and modify them in

1036
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,160
simple risk or any other good jrc tool

1037
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,920
for that matter they can be entered by

1038
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,839
someone and we can triage them and sort

1039
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,160
of override that and record our decision

1040
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,880
so every time i tweak a risk

1041
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,359
i will document it in the notes field so

1042
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,200
what's interesting here is let's assume

1043
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,960
we've generated the risk we've created

1044
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,599
it somehow we agree it really is a 10.

1045
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,040
we have the opportunity now to talk

1046
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
about treatment how are we going to deal

1047
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
with this risk and we all know that

1048
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,760
there's a standard formula right there's

1049
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,839
like five things we do we can accept it

1050
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,680
we can transfer it with with insurance

1051
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,320
we can fix it we can uh what else can we

1052
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
do we can reject it by just turning that

1053
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,119
system off lots of different options we

1054
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,760
can capture those as a proposal here in

1055
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,200
simple risk

1056
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
yeah and so this is this is the

1057
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,119
mitigation page right this is where we

1058
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,960
are deciding here's what we're going to

1059
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
do next what's that strategy look like

1060
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
do i accept transfer whatever but

1061
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,560
probably more importantly is we're

1062
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
deciding what we're going to do here so

1063
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,160
you look at the current solution this is

1064
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,599
where we're at today this is what we're

1065
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,119
doing there may be some controls in

1066
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
place right now we start to look at the

1067
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,560
requirements these are the things we

1068
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
have to do and then the recommendations

1069
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,920
these are probably the things that we

1070
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,720
should do and then you'll notice

1071
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,400
just really quick josh this is the

1072
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,920
definition of done so i won't let a a

1073
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,359
risk owner

1074
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,240
um

1075
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,560
review a risk or i want to let a risk

1076
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
get to a risk owner without defining the

1077
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,560
definition of done for them so it's very

1078
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,720
very clear what they have to do to fix

1079
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,359
this risk yeah it's the bar it's when we

1080
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,520
meet this bar we can say that we're good

1081
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
who are here we've achieved that level

1082
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
and kind to that point you have that may

1083
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,119
gain controls along the bottom there

1084
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,880
where i can say hey these are the

1085
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
controls we need to have in place in

1086
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,170
order to fully mitigate this risk

1087
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,320
[Music]

1088
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,760
now next

1089
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,599
do you want me to take this sorry yeah

1090
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,680
go forward okay i'll take this one so

1091
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,920
next step that happens we've we've found

1092
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,320
a risk we've come up with a proposed

1093
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,760
mitigation or a proposed treatment for

1094
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,079
the risk now what we do is we take this

1095
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,160
to senior management and we perform a

1096
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,560
review senior management sits down

1097
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,119
generally um you know maybe not at a at

1098
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,359
the risk committee level but at the risk

1099
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,880
you know whoever on the senior

1100
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,359
leadership team owns risks in some cases

1101
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,040
that might be the cso if the cso's

1102
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,200
dialed in enough to business challenges

1103
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
and solutions they may be the one making

1104
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,079
those decisions

1105
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,760
but regardless we sit down with them and

1106
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,599
we go through these risks and that

1107
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,000
senior leader has the opportunity to say

1108
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,359
yes or no this is what i want to do this

1109
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,960
i don't want to do this and so forth and

1110
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,839
we capture it on record and what's neat

1111
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,400
is a good flexible risk system is

1112
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,160
flexible enough to allow different

1113
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
individuals to capture and go on record

1114
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,920
for how they're going to handle

1115
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,839
different risks based primarily on the

1116
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,200
risk and the impact to the to the

1117
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,359
company so josh you want to show us that

1118
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,280
yeah so when i was at national

1119
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
instruments one of the things that i

1120
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
started looking at was the rest of my

1121
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,320
organization i started to get this kind

1122
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,839
of registry of all the different risks

1123
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,359
out there and it looked kind of like

1124
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,760
this it was a pyramid and i had a lot of

1125
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
stuff on the bottom and i had not so

1126
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,320
much stuff on the top right and most of

1127
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
your risks are going to look something

1128
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,760
like this for most of our organizations

1129
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
well i started thinking about this and

1130
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
the other thing that looked like a

1131
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,800
pyramid was my management i i had you

1132
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
know my ceo and then my presence and my

1133
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,440
vps and whatnot and so when i started

1134
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,119
looking at how to to kind of put my

1135
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,520
program together well what i said was

1136
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
all right why don't i say that my

1137
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
managers they have the ability to review

1138
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,200
the insignificant low level risk these

1139
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,720
are things that they have the money the

1140
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
people to be able to address within

1141
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
their purview and then i started looking

1142
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,240
at the section managers and i said hey

1143
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
you guys you'll do medium level risk

1144
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
because you have a little bit bigger

1145
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,320
budget and more personnel and then the

1146
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,200
uh vps you know or the directors they

1147
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,119
would do the high level risk might be

1148
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,880
she would do the hot the very high level

1149
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
risk and so what i found was i could

1150
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
build the visibility

1151
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
and the accountability into the chain of

1152
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,560
management i could basically assign the

1153
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
review of the different risk levels

1154
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
based on where you were in the

1155
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,320
management chain i ended up being hugely

1156
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,079
effective now there's going to be

1157
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
permissions for other things in here too

1158
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,000
we can decide who can create risks who

1159
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,240
can modify risk things like that uh we

1160
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,320
can determine who can plan mitigations

1161
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,800
who can accept them uh and things like

1162
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,119
that so lots of permissions need to be

1163
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,040
built in the system and this is where we

1164
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
start moving light years away from our

1165
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,560
spreadsheets because we couldn't do this

1166
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
at all when it came to the spreadsheet

1167
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,560
yep i mean it mirrors another business

1168
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,720
process which is the uh the budget

1169
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,640
approval process right low level

1170
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,400
managers can approve so much spend

1171
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,640
medium level managers so much spend so

1172
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
on and so forth same thing around risk

1173
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,880
lower level managers are allowed to take

1174
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,960
a certain amount of risk on and as you

1175
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,440
move up the uh the seniority chain you

1176
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
are allowed to or welcome to or invited

1177
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,880
to or responsible to take on more risk

1178
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
yeah so let's take a second and let's

1179
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,040
move on and let's talk about the

1180
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,880
informed decision making how do we

1181
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
actually decide which risk we're going

1182
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,119
to fix which risk we're going to ignore

1183
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,800
for the time being

1184
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,520
and the answer is reporting and this

1185
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
again is getting away from those

1186
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
spreadsheets we need to enable the

1187
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,920
business to make those informed

1188
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,839
risk-based decisions and there's a few

1189
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,359
different ways that we can kind of do

1190
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,839
that um traditionally we look at the the

1191
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,599
highest level risk in the organization

1192
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,599
we point to that thing that's the very

1193
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,520
worst thing in our organization and we

1194
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,920
say that's the thing i should fix perks

1195
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,720
and without any other contacts that may

1196
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,560
very well be the case

1197
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,160
but when you start to pull in the

1198
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,560
context piece you may realize that that

1199
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,720
might not be the most important thing or

1200
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
it might be not be the one to fix first

1201
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
maybe the level of effort uh is you know

1202
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,760
it's gonna cost us a million dollars to

1203
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
fix a risk that might cost us half a

1204
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,240
million dollars should we fix that risk

1205
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,440
probably not right but it all we need

1206
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,040
that context

1207
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,720
now the other thing that we can do is we

1208
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,760
can look at uh the the level of appetite

1209
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,599
so every organization your level of

1210
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,960
appetite is going to be completely

1211
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,760
different uh and you'll say hey uh

1212
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
usually when you start you're gonna be

1213
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,240
like well we got a lot of tanks right so

1214
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,079
my level of appetite is gonna be really

1215
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,920
really high because i just don't have

1216
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,520
the time to deal with anything that's

1217
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,760
underneath that okay josh let me let me

1218
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,599
just interject really quickly here level

1219
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
of appetite or risk appetite here is the

1220
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,160
level of risk you're comfortable

1221
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,599
operating in

1222
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,040
so

1223
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,599
you risk tolerance if there's a one

1224
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
most of us don't care about the ones

1225
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,240
right they're just sort of annoying

1226
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,800
gnats uh tens like those are the

1227
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
rhinoceroses that are trumping through

1228
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,880
our camp so companies generally are

1229
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,560
somewhere in between a one and a ten in

1230
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
their risk appetite and as josh is

1231
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,319
indicating you know that will change

1232
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,599
over time as well but i just wanted to

1233
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,599
call that out yeah that's that's a great

1234
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,920
point now um you know when we're making

1235
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
our decisions we're probably if we're

1236
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
using this kind of higher level risk

1237
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,880
we're going to start off looking at

1238
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,319
those really big ones and then we'll

1239
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,240
work our way down so your appetite will

1240
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,560
actually change over time it's going to

1241
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
start off being super high but as you

1242
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,400
start to eliminate a lot of the the high

1243
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,240
level stuff your appetizer can get

1244
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,319
smaller and smaller and smaller because

1245
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,760
you've actually fixed a lot of these

1246
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,960
issues

1247
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,720
now the other thing that we can do here

1248
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
is we can look at that level of effort

1249
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
now this is when we start to look at

1250
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,800
contacts and so we can look at the

1251
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,640
mitigation if we said the mitigation for

1252
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,599
this is trivial uh but it's a 10 risk

1253
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,520
score that's my low-hanging fruit that's

1254
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,280
the thing that i should attack first

1255
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
because that's where i'm gonna get the

1256
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,880
most bang for my buck whereas you know

1257
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,560
if i have something that's gonna be a

1258
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
significant amount of effort but is you

1259
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,359
know one level risk i probably should

1260
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,599
save that one towards the end

1261
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,599
now the other thing that we can do here

1262
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,280
is we can look at the controls we talked

1263
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,200
about the controls um and so when we're

1264
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
making decisions we can look at this

1265
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,040
control and we can say all right look at

1266
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,720
all of the risks that are tied to this

1267
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,319
particular control there's a lot of

1268
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,119
risks here if this control fails for any

1269
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,760
reason what does my organization look

1270
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
like now and now we can start to talk

1271
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,079
about defense and death should i add an

1272
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,560
additional control in place because you

1273
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
know if this control fails i don't have

1274
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,800
anything to compensate for that um and

1275
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,200
so this can help us to identify where

1276
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,520
those gaps may be or where we're relying

1277
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,400
too heavily on a single point of value

1278
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,760
the key here is that there is

1279
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
flexibility in how we

1280
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,720
present and analyze our risk uh through

1281
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,280
different um different pivots right

1282
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,000
pivoting off controls pivoting off cost

1283
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,480
pivoting off overall risk and appetite

1284
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,960
and so forth so that flexibility allows

1285
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,880
us to do a couple of things number one

1286
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,280
we can examine things in different ways

1287
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,520
and derive kind of a consensus opinion

1288
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,160
based on those multiple approaches

1289
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,880
number two we may have a leader who has

1290
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,280
a specific agenda or specific

1291
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,440
responsibilities and we want to pivot

1292
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,520
and show them risks related to their

1293
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,920
responsibility so that flexibility is

1294
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,319
key and critical for us in that risk

1295
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,040
management discussion

1296
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
so look i want to step back here and

1297
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,280
just kind of wrap up where we've been

1298
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,359
and what we've been done so we started

1299
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,359
out talking about the atlas syndrome

1300
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,720
right carrying the weight on our

1301
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,760
shoulders because we have these lists on

1302
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,560
our desktop full of risks we know so

1303
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,480
much about this organization it's

1304
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,960
overwhelming and we've talked about now

1305
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,280
how to how to move that conversation

1306
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,760
from oh my gosh this patch isn't in

1307
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,359
place we've got to stop everything and

1308
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,280
do it we want to move our conversation

1309
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,000
from that to a conversation about risk

1310
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
and talk about risk in terms of relative

1311
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,839
risk business risk and risk ownership

1312
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,079
when we make this adjustment right so

1313
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,240
again we've we've uh eschewed the blue

1314
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,680
pill and we've taken the red pill we're

1315
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
changing the way we talk no longer we

1316
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,280
speaking binary we're speaking on a

1317
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
scale of one to ten and we're speaking

1318
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,160
about the actual owners of the risk

1319
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,040
now

1320
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,880
we give management the context that

1321
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
needs to make informed decisions about

1322
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,599
treating risk and we have a platform to

1323
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,839
communicate it across the business this

1324
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,880
is revolutionary because um you know for

1325
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
me i started my career with fear

1326
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,800
uncertainty and doubt and it got me so

1327
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
far not very far but it got me so far i

1328
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,119
had a few things fixed but what was

1329
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,280
interesting is i kept uncovering more

1330
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,720
stuff and eventually i asked myself

1331
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,960
what's the definition of done here

1332
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,119
and realized the approach i was taking i

1333
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,960
was burning you know i only had a few

1334
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,880
tickets here to share and i was burning

1335
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,359
them pretty quickly and so i knew i had

1336
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,560
to change what i was doing and that's

1337
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,480
where i stopped dropped back

1338
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,079
and started to look at more of a

1339
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,079
risk-based formula and more of an

1340
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,760
indexed approach

1341
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
by tackling this approach the other

1342
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,520
thing i was able to do was finally put

1343
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,160
responsibility for risk where it belongs

1344
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,119
if i don't own the tool if i can't

1345
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,359
deploy the patch myself

1346
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,440
i don't own the risk and i need to find

1347
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,839
a way to communicate that as a cso but

1348
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,640
also i needed that as a director as a vp

1349
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
and as a consultant ownership of risk is

1350
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,640
what we're really talking about here

1351
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,119
ownership and relative measuring and a

1352
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,440
good solid grc solution helps us get

1353
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,040
there now we've talked a lot about

1354
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
simple risk today not because it's a

1355
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,480
sales pitch but because it's a great

1356
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,079
tool that really helps us get our job

1357
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,960
done

1358
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,720
i highly recommend you take a look at it

1359
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,480
josh josh's team has a bunch of videos

1360
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,920
out there how to use it

1361
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
but for me it really was revolutionary

1362
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,599
it allowed me to put all my data in one

1363
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,839
place pivot on it and really communicate

1364
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,760
and assign ownership so

1365
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,280
i appreciate josh and the work that he's

1366
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
done to produce simple risk but i also

1367
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,200
appreciate the the progress that i've

1368
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
made because of my risk-based

1369
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
communication

1370
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,599
awesome

1371
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,400
uh well very cool so uh that kind of

1372
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,800
wraps our presentation for today um

1373
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,880
we'll go into the chat and see uh what

1374
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
questions there i see one

1375
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,599
uh right now from ricky uh so ricky

1376
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,839
asked us in performing remediation and

1377
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,319
mitigation why not revisiting the impact

1378
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,240
and likelihood instead of the percentage

1379
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,400
uh so you absolutely can uh when it

1380
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,560
comes to inherent risk score you can

1381
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,400
certainly reevaluate the impact and the

1382
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,240
likelihood and we didn't show it in this

1383
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,480
presentation but there is a risk scoring

1384
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,720
history and the system will trap that so

1385
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,119
if you actually change the likelihood or

1386
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,240
the impact of the risk itself um you're

1387
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,160
going to be able to reflect that now the

1388
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,839
reason why i went with the mitigation

1389
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,720
it's simple i my whole goal when i was

1390
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,480
designing simple risk was simplicity i

1391
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,240
wanted to keep in mind that there's a

1392
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,640
lot of people in my organization that

1393
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,920
did not understand uh

1394
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,839
they had a mandate to do risk management

1395
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,640
but that wasn't their job right and so

1396
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
when it came to that i could be like hey

1397
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,200
when you applied this particular control

1398
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
how effective was it and it could go um

1399
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,200
i feel like it was twenty percent

1400
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,160
effective then go boom 20 right

1401
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,760
that was the kind of approach that i was

1402
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,119
taking when when i went for the

1403
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,040
mitigation percent now we do have an

1404
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,440
item on the roadmap to be able to apply

1405
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,319
uh likely an impact to the residual risk

1406
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,040
as well um but honestly i feel like the

1407
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,240
fact that you can do that to the

1408
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,160
internet risk or that you can do a

1409
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,319
mitigation percent um

1410
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,119
it kind of gives you the same value i in

1411
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,520
much simpler format so you know just to

1412
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,440
kind of to dog pile on that i actually

1413
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,640
do both so i'll all i'll create a risk

1414
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,160
sometimes one of the nice things about

1415
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,079
simple risk is i can actually generate a

1416
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,359
questionnaire

1417
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,599
and when i'm creating the questionnaire

1418
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,160
i can tell simple risk if the answer to

1419
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,720
this question is no open a risk

1420
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,240
automatically so i don't have to sit

1421
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,880
there and hand type all my risks in

1422
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,720
but but what happens sometimes is you

1423
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,800
know you don't have context so i just

1424
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,119
pick okay in general this controls

1425
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,680
probably a four or a seven or whatever

1426
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,000
once that risk is auto generated i will

1427
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,200
sit down with a risk owner and we'll

1428
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,800
talk about it and we'll discuss what's

1429
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,599
really going on in the risk assessment

1430
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,200
and notes fields i'll capture that

1431
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,280
information and then i'll probably tweet

1432
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,440
the risk score in fact i spent an hour

1433
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,680
with a ceo this morning going over that

1434
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,319
very same exercise where we tweaked risk

1435
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,720
scores and then as josh said when i

1436
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,720
throw a control in place if i haven't

1437
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,400
completely mitigated the risk i want to

1438
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,480
know that if i've only brought my risk

1439
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,319
score down by 20

1440
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,160
then my risk may have gone from a 10 to

1441
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,400
an eight um that's good there's control

1442
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,680
in place but i haven't dealt with it all

1443
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,280
so both both approaches are necessary

1444
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
and josh my screen's a long ways away

1445
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,559
from me because the way i set things up

1446
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,440
so i'm going to have you read the

1447
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,960
questions and we can go back and forth

1448
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,880
answering them yeah i i don't see any

1449
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,440
other questions right now um i think

1450
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,040
ricky's was the last one that was up

1451
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,359
there so all right i know we're we're

1452
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,599
sitting about 10 seconds behind uh them

1453
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,680
so maybe somebody's thinking of some

1454
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,839
amazing question to ask or maybe john

1455
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,680
you and i were just so good at answering

1456
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,839
all the questions anticipating uh what

1457
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,319
they would come up with uh that we don't

1458
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,559
need to answer anything else yeah um

1459
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,280
usually silence worries me all right if

1460
