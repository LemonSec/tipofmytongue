in the industry and

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
that's about me

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
and now coming to the topic cyber

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
security

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
mindset a ceaseless erudition

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,400
so let's break into uh the topic as to

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
what is cyber security first and then

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
i will go about explaining why on earth

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
it's a ceaseless irritation and what

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
does evaluation means it means learning

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
and

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,920
as a cyber security practitioner one is

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,159
supposed to be a lifelong learner

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,759
because no two days are the same and

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
you have to think the unthinkables and

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
do the undoables

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,000
and stay vigilant every day is a new

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
challenge and it's it's exciting as

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
as long as you're a lifelong learner

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
so coming to cyber security what it is

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
cyber security it is a state of being

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,320
and it is defined as people powered

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,520
perpetual innovation

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
in the book called cyber security

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
leadership by dr mansoor haseeb because

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
while technology dynamics keeps changing

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
it's the human factor that serves the

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
weakest and the strongest link in the

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
world of cyber security which happens to

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
be a very deep and vast ocean in itself

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,400
there are empty earth number of ways you

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
can break into cyber security and that

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
is why i say it's a ceaseless erodion

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,760
because it's not a state but a process

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
and

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
earlier

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
it used to be information security which

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
used to be the 1991 model of

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,000
modern dynamic model

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
in such a model data used to exist in

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
three possible states

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
transmission storage and processing

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,319
because cyber security seeks to maintain

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,319
confidentiality

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
integrity and availability

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
of systems and information

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
we use three tools people policy and

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
technology to achieve cyber security

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,040
goals and people are the most critical

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
element as i already mentioned

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
and as a matter of natural

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
security the critical role of people and

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,400
innovation and cyber security

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
must be recognized and accepted

80
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
and

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,599
that is why there is a major policy

82
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,720
persistent in minds of many people that

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,080
cyber security is a stem discipline stem

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
equals science technology

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
engineering and maths it is not it's a

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
business discipline

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
because disciplinary diversity of people

88
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
is essential for a successful

89
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
organizational cyber security strategy

90
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
people from almost all disciplines such

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
as sociology linguistics psychology

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,599
political science language arts business

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,480
law

94
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
finance criminal justice and foreign

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,040
whatnot can succeed in some aspects of

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
cyber security and they are

97
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
most welcomed in this

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
field

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,280
and

100
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
those who

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
adhere to the jaundiced view that people

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
are mailing to be the weakest link

103
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,720
resort to more control cyber security

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,479
programs and surveillance of people

105
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,199
which creates a police state and stifle

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,120
innovations

107
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
you have to be very smart

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
when

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
working as a cyber security practitioner

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,759
because

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
there is the exploration and

112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,680
exploitation trade-off that is the

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,320
fundamental dilemma wherever whenever

114
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
you learn about the world by trying

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
things out

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
and since it's interdisciplinary you can

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
explore it to no extent if i share my

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
own story

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,880
i

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
was

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479
first a technical person super technical

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,560
person doing penetration testing in my

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
first organization

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
then moving on i

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
got into

126
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
management i pursued a degree in

127
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
cyber security mba

128
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
came to my recent organization where i

129
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
served

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
various

131
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,800
roles

132
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
i have been an auditor i have been a

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
simulating fishing

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
expert i have been a pre-sales engineer

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
when time was required

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,320
an educator a public speaker because

137
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
that is why and what makes me here

138
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
so there are multiple hands that i have

139
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,919
done

140
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,280
education

141
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
what kept me going was

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
the

143
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,000
mindset of exploring things because

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
there are so many strengths that we as

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,919
you uh individuals have

146
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,560
but to use those strengths

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,520
at appropriate places to help you walk

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
the long

149
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
run run the long run and walk the long

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
mile

151
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
is required and in my case i have been

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
fortunate because i used to enjoy

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,479
writing so that helped me as a person

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
who used to contribute blogs

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,039
i learned technical writing in the

156
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,440
process i used to love speaking or

157
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,759
listening to people once upon a time i

158
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
also aspired to be a journalist

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
so now i get to do all the public

160
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,479
speaking

161
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,840
i have been fortunate to train so many

162
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
people

163
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,000
and

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
the fact that

165
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,880
this all was possible was because i kept

166
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
exploring i

167
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,680
remained a student for life

168
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
and i

169
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
i learned one thing very

170
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,880
very beautifully that

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
anything that you want to explore if you

172
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
have the mindset of a hungry person

173
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
who wants to

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,319
explore break the things so when as a

175
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,440
technical person i used to work

176
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,639
all my

177
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
bosses taught me

178
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
was

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
that i got to break the code

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
because

181
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
it's very myopic if you think as a

182
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
tester all you have to do is pass or

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
fail the case

184
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
test case so what i used to do was i

185
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,560
used to

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
explore this

187
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
code syntax

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
could be different logic is very much

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
important so now

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
people are

191
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
always saying that technical skills are

192
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,840
difficult

193
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,039
that is not

194
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
if you explore the technical aspects of

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
cyber security technology is nothing but

196
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,160
but ornamental mathematics so if you're

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
good at calculation

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
and if you're good at discerning the

199
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
patterns identifying patterns it's the

200
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
right place for you

201
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,120
if you are somebody who loves to

202
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
bridge the gap between the technical

203
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,159
team

204
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,799
and the

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
business owners

206
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,679
and a person who can uh

207
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,640
be there out there help both of them

208
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
come to a common stand

209
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,880
cyber security is for you

210
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
and

211
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
if at all you are a person

212
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,640
that

213
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
loves speaking or sharing knowledge

214
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,519
against cybersecurity is you we have so

215
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,720
many great influencers around the world

216
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,519
we have so many people who contribute to

217
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,040
cyber security community and the fact

218
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,279
that you can start from wherever you

219
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,880
want and every expert is important

220
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,480
is what makes cyber security a very

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
interesting discipline

222
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
to be in

223
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
you will find help whenever you need you

224
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,560
can keep exploring whatever you want you

225
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,600
can go through identify appropriate

226
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
mentors who will help you walk through

227
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
sail through

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,399
the disciplines you are interested in

229
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
and that will make cyber security a path

230
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
you would wish to choose

231
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
it's ceaseless because

232
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
learning is a lifelong process

233
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,560
and ideas rule the world and knowledge

234
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
is power all three dimensions that i

235
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,959
mentioned learning

236
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,000
ideas and knowledge are quintessential

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
part of psy

238
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
of being in cyber security you cannot

239
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,519
choose to

240
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
go dinosaur with your learning you

241
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
cannot be a subject matter expert for

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
just one thing and ignore the rest you

243
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
have to be holistically acute and that

244
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
is what will take you

245
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
high up the ladder faster too

246
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,680
and to be holistically approved you will

247
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
have to constantly brainstorm identify

248
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,040
as ideas where you can explore different

249
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,920
mine

250
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,519
um

251
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,519
miniature mindsets and also ask for work

252
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,040
be proactive

253
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
because that goes a long way if you can

254
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
understand the side of both

255
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
both the side if you can break the

256
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
things and then

257
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
think from the mind of a hacker if you

258
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,519
can think like a hacker if you can think

259
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
like a person who solves the problem

260
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,640
if you can behave like a resilient

261
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,200
person who is not afraid

262
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
to

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
fail and then bounce back cyber security

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
is for you

265
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
and also if you are somebody

266
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,279
who loves to explore and also meet new

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,560
people

268
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
cyber security is again for you

269
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
because

270
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
we as cyber security practitioners are

271
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
super privileged imagine me

272
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
sitting at india at 3 00 am in the

273
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,760
morning and talking to you all the way

274
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
at vancouver that's a privilege because

275
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
i belong to this domain i have the

276
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,760
privilege of learning from the most best

277
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
minds in the world and

278
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
also

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
giving back whatever little i know of

280
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
this

281
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
thing

282
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,399
all i can say

283
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,279
why this is a ceaseless irritation is

284
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,720
because

285
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,360
ignorance of basics

286
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,000
is not a good idea you

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
as long as you have your basics right

288
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,680
there are infinite possibilities for all

289
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
of us to explore

290
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
all we have to do

291
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
is make our hands dirty try

292
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
because

293
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
having the hands-on experience a

294
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,519
demonstrated history across various

295
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,519
domain is powerful

296
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,240
it makes you wiser it makes your concept

297
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,639
stronger and it makes you

298
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
a strong professional

299
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
because you will be never be ex afraid

300
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
to explore and you will never be afraid

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,720
to take up new challenges and be a new

302
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
person every day so that makes cyber

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
security a ceaseless irritation do we

304
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,439
have questions

305
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
i would also like to add a very

306
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,639
beautiful learning that my mentor taught

307
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,680
me

308
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,800
her name is dr angelina garcley she says

309
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,279
when you stop thinking the attacker

310
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
starts thinking continual learning is

311
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,440
the key to effective security management

312
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
so

313
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,079
you trust nobody and yet

314
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,760
you trust that there are tools which can

315
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
help you cover the un uncovered and

316
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,199
explore the unexplorable be a new person

317
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,320
every day be a hungry learner every day

318
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
and just be enjoy the process it's

319
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,480
too much fun to be here

320
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,600
