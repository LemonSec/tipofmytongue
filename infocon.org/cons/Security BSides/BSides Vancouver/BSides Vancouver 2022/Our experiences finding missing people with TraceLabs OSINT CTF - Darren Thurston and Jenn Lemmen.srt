awesome so let's uh let's get into it

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,720
what is ocean if

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,119
you didn't attend ritu's

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
talk earlier today

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
uh and in case you didn't i highly

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
recommend that you go back and check it

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
out it was very good uh ocean stands for

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
open cells open source intelligence

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
basically what that means is it's the

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
type of intelligence community a type of

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
security

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,079
topic that draws from

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,520
openly available public public material

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
basically stuff for your mom or your

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
grandma or maybe even you i hope not you

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,079
but

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
your mom and grandma like to post on

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,719
facebook

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
a little bit about trace labs we're

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,598
going to be talking about the trace labs

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,760
ctf trace labs is a canadian non-profit

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,000
organization and their mission is to

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
facilitate

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,239
and accelerate the family reunification

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
of missing persons well uh the other

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,599
side of that is to train

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,760
ocean enthusiasts up on on the

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
tradecraft

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,920
and so what is trace lab ctf it is a

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,440
regularly scheduled i think they're

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
doing it once every every couple of

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,879
months at this point

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,680
a ctf where new and seasoned

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,000
enthusiasts like ourselves get together

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
for a friendly competition

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,319
where the outcome has real world

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,319
benefits

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
so how does the tracelab ctf work um

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
ctf stands for capture the flag just in

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
case anybody didn't know yeah but uh the

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,560
traceup ctf works like this um basically

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
um you create an account on the platform

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
that the ctf tracelabs platform that

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
they have

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
um

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
you can have it you can join a team or

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,519
create a team a team of one is fine up

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,879
to four people

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
uh it can be on one team um they have a

86
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,440
there's all kind they've been doing this

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
for a while so it's great they have a

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
big intro call zoom call for all the

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
everybody that's participating in the

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
ctf um usually there's about 600 people

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,239
in each ctf that participate all total

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,080
and they go over the rules of engagement

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,840
and uh some of this is really important

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,720
because um this is not you know you're

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,319
looking at real missing people so

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,760
there's some definitely some great rules

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
of engagement that are really important

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
um some things like no password resets

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
and things like that we'll talk a little

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
bit more about in a little bit

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
um so at the kickoff when they start the

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,519
event um they basically release um the

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
subject information on the

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
on the ctf platform and it's from

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
anywhere from four to six missing people

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
usually that are real missing people

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,200
cases and they provide information to

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
you on those missing people

109
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,720
um

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
and so the

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
tracelab ctf also has a discord channel

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
which really helps for communicating

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
with finding information about the ctf

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,239
and communicating with your judge during

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,480
the event so that helps a lot to be

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,840
on there also which is a separate

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
platform in the trace lab ctf

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,839
so

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,960
uh how does a ctf work at traceland ctf

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,639
work so basics after you after you the

121
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
kickoff call you basically spend the

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,199
next four to six hours and that can vary

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
depending on the ctf uh scouring the

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
internet looking for flags to score

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,720
points

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,960
uh we'll get to the plagues flags in a

127
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
couple of minutes but one of the key

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
differences between this type of ztf and

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
a regular type of ctf is the

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,960
the ctfs that some of you may already be

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
familiar with they have intentionally

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
vulnerable systems with intentionally

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,080
planted flags these ones uh that the

134
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
the ctf that we're that we're

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
talking about today

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
the flags actually have to do with real

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
life people missing people uh different

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
aspects of their life their family

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
um they're basically made up of

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
breadcrumbs around the internet that are

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
that may or may not be there for you to

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,400
find

143
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,840
um so you look for the flags you

144
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
screenshot

145
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
the evidence you submit them like you're

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,320
going to be audited so your submissions

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
are judged like gary mentioned you have

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
a judge

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
uh you want to make sure that you

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
outline the category you want to give

151
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
them the evidence and then you want to

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,560
give them

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
why you think this is actually related

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,759
to

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
the investigation uh what about this is

156
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,560
pertinent and how it's helpful

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,639
uh the evidence will get submitted to

158
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
law enforcement after everything's

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,240
wrapped up to help with the case which

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
is pretty cool

161
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
uh there is a strict no contact rule the

162
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
the subject or the subject's family

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
are often dealing with some really

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,199
painful

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
feelings and obviously like if you if

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
you know somebody that's gone missing

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
you know how uh devastating that can be

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,440
so

169
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
i mean imagine if you've got 600 ocean

170
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,360
enthusiasts

171
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
suddenly adding it to facebook or adding

172
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
you to instagram um

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,680
it can also really damage the hard work

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,880
that the investigators have put in to

175
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,360
the uh into the the case to date

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
no

177
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
you've got

178
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
like we're saying no password resets

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,039
exactly 600 people or 300 people doing

180
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
password resets is not good

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
this is not often

182
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,560
if the missing person doesn't want to be

183
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
found it can also tip them off that

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,080
someone is looking for them

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
yeah okay so talk a little bit about the

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
scoring system so this is how the

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
scoring system works for the ctf and

188
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
it's interesting

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,199
um so we start out with the lowest

190
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,039
points here and uh so providing

191
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,400
information about friends so any

192
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,840
relevant information on friends

193
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,599
including but not limited to

194
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,560
so name aliases birth dates id driver's

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
license passport work address work phone

196
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,720
number email home address phone number

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
uh if insightful information from

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
friends comments so a lot of this stuff

199
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
is from a lot of the investigations tend

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
to focus on social media stuff a lot of

201
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,919
the people right so this is all

202
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,039
interesting so you can't just go to

203
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
facebook and submit every single one of

204
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
their friends but if they know their

205
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,599
best friends like you knew there's

206
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,960
definitely this is information that's

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
pertinent to the investigation so but

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
this is the lowest scored uh the lowest

209
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
scoring points employment um so some

210
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
other a little bit in the 15 points

211
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,680
information regarding employment but not

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
limited to business name aliases manager

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
start date and date ids you might send

214
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
some photos and they're wearing the

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,879
mcdonald's shirt etc you name it um

216
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,080
things like that

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
uh social media handle of

218
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
their employer et cetera things like

219
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,360
that

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,280
um when they start and give us the

221
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
information they really they give you

222
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,240
very little information they might give

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
you like a little blurb and a link to a

224
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
missing person site um you get you get a

225
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,319
little information you know their name

226
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,440
you know what's going on you know a

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
little bit about where how long they've

228
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
been missing um and what country they're

229
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
from and the people are mis we get every

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,960
time there is people from all over the

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
world um missing so last couple of

232
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
events there's been a couple people from

233
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
the united states there's been somebody

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
from canada there's been somebody from

235
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,759
australia there's been people from

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
england so it varies every event

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
yeah um

238
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,440
just continuing on on the scoring system

239
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,839
uh in case you in case we didn't mention

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,039
it or in case you haven't figured it out

241
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
these are all of the flags that you're

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
looking for

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
so

244
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,839
your family gets a little bit more

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,440
more points there a little bit harder to

246
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
find

247
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,040
so

248
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,760
mom dad brother sister extended family

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,399
cousins aunts uncles etc uh what are

250
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
their ids what are their birth dates

251
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
what are their

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,560
information their their pii if you will

253
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
or any insightful

254
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
information from families comments

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
around

256
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,959
you know where

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,800
uh where they might be or the date that

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
they went missing or the date that they

259
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
were last seen

260
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
that kind of thing

261
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
again home a lot of the times the

262
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
subject's home isn't published on the

263
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,399
internet but you might be able to find

264
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
what street they are on and then

265
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,399
using other photos from

266
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
websites that they've posted to figure

267
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
out which house they grew up in or which

268
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
house that they most recently uh lived

269
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,839
in um where their

270
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,560
landlord's name recent accommodations

271
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
any habits that they have you know do

272
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,480
they go coach surfing

273
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
that kind of thing

274
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
this is a good one too i'll mention them

275
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,279
but of course risks in the immediate

276
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,959
area sex offenders of course these are

277
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
all very uh pertinent things to an

278
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
investigation and habits it says scout

279
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,680
surfing but one of the other things

280
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
which is possibly pertinent to missing

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
people some of the other habits could be

282
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,480
um drug use smoking weed a lot of the

283
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
people wouldn't you know it might it

284
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
might be printed to the investigation it

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
might not be but in a lot of

286
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
past events um we'll see teenagers in

287
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
there posting photos of them drinking

288
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
and smoking and whatever on

289
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
on instagram and these are all pertinent

290
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
um they're printed to an investigation

291
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
definitely so they're all worth points

292
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
okay so the next here we go now we're

293
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
getting up there so 50 points so basic

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,959
subject information so things related to

295
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
the missing person name any aliases so

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
any other aliases or social media

297
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,360
handles uh birth date id emails

298
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,880
a lot of us have five emails ten emails

299
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
social media handles and recent

300
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
investigations we've had all kinds of

301
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
people that have

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
three different instagram accounts and

303
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
three different facebook accounts and

304
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
old blogs or old forum posts or personal

305
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,640
websites

306
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,079
i've had recently uh during ctf uh

307
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
people that were missing that were 18

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
and of course had uh accounts on dating

309
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
sites and they said they were 19 of

310
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
course and you know things like that

311
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
that's all very pertinent especially

312
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
things like that um craigslist reddit

313
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,240
accounts online resumes physical

314
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
descriptions that aren't included in our

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
original information um

316
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,760
and then

317
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
advanced subject information um so

318
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
these are more pertinent so unique

319
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
identifiers so they got piercings they

320
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,320
have it ear pierced they have a tattoo

321
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
they have scars

322
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
medical issues um so this can be gleaned

323
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
from a lot of social media

324
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,279
um so things like they might have a any

325
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,640
type of medical issue it might be

326
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,079
permanent

327
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,600
and then we go into habits and i did

328
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
mention this uh but this is specific to

329
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
the to the subject so smoking drinking

330
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,839
hitchhiking hangouts all very pertinent

331
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,320
to possible missing person cases

332
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
previous missing person's history um

333
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
this actually does pop up and has popped

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
up in recent ctfs where uh they have

335
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
been been mis a missing person before uh

336
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
in the past and um

337
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
so maybe they ran maybe they ran away

338
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
maybe they've whatever right um brand

339
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,079
and model carrier of cell phones um all

340
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
worth some good points uh and um you're

341
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
like how do i find that out well

342
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
people post photos of them with their

343
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,720
phones a lot very often on social media

344
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
and you know that's an iphone or that's

345
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,519
or whatever

346
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
or if you have a phone number you can

347
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
find out what their carrier is things

348
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
like that um video game handles a lot of

349
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
the recent subjects have all kinds of

350
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
video game handles they play video games

351
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,839
non-stop

352
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
ip address you might be able to find or

353
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,800
any other information regarding to your

354
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
actual the subject themselves so

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,320
yeah i remember one specific photo uh

356
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,079
for a subject we were looking for it was

357
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,040
a selfie

358
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
of this person at the gym so you

359
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
automatically knew that they

360
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
were going to the gym they were a gym

361
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,839
goer

362
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
it exposed some tattoos on their arms

363
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
that you weren't able to see in other

364
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,160
photos

365
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,200
and they also had a you're all

366
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
also able to see

367
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
the fact that it was an iphone and it

368
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,160
was a more recent one because it had all

369
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
of the cameras

370
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
and so right there you've got

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
450 points from three flags

372
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
so when you've got

373
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
one

374
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
photo really scour that and make sure

375
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
that you get all of the flags that you

376
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
can get from the uh

377
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
get from the photo

378
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,920
i got a question i'm gonna answer

379
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
quickly somebody's asking uh

380
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,560
uh if we've uh how many of the flags

381
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
have already been found or if we

382
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
contributed to helping find intel on the

383
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
person's in question so the ctf uh

384
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
basically for the four hours or four to

385
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
six hours all the teams submit flags and

386
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,639
they're all judged by

387
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,320
every team has a judge and it's all

388
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
judged basically um you get points if

389
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
they consider it being a valid uh flag

390
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,680
and at the end of the ctf all of those

391
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,120
all of that information is provided to

392
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
law enforcement regarding those missing

393
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
people so that's all that information is

394
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
given at the end of every event and um

395
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
there's a lot of a lot you'll see we'll

396
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
show you some sites in a bit about how

397
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
much information is actually submitted

398
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,079
from 600 people in four hours and it's a

399
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,040
lot

400
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
um so yeah

401
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,920
so

402
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
uh

403
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,360
jen you want to do this one over me

404
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
let's see there last day

405
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,560
the uh i was gonna say too the

406
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
um there will be a lot of duplicate

407
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
flags submitted obviously by multiple

408
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,079
teams but that doesn't matter you you

409
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,199
can't see what other teams are

410
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
submitting so

411
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,519
you may or may not be able to um you may

412
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,920
not you may or may not get a unique flag

413
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,279
right

414
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,120
but that correlates the information for

415
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
law enforcement if they're getting it

416
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,760
from you know from 100 people and

417
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
they're providing the same information

418
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
that's right

419
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,519
which is

420
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,800
i'm good

421
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,360
uh last slide so these are kind of the

422
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
these are the high scoring flags they

423
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,199
last seen

424
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,560
do you

425
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
are you able to do a showdown search for

426
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
example if you know which way the

427
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
subject was headed down a street are you

428
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
able to do a showdown search of

429
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
um

430
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,839
cctv in the area to see

431
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,120
video footage of when they

432
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,959
the day that they were walking down the

433
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,519
street uh any any details what they were

434
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,040
wearing what they were uh what their

435
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
mood was

436
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,279
did they have a fight with somebody

437
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,680
before they left that kind of thing uh

438
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
who were they last seen with did they

439
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,639
meet up with somebody in a park before

440
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,160
they disappeared

441
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
uh which way did they go anywhere

442
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,880
any anything that

443
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
is uh is going to give law enforcement

444
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,880
the

445
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,959
uh an inkling of as to

446
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,279
where to keep looking

447
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,079
uh dark web is worth a thousand points a

448
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,680
piece and

449
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,199
it

450
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,720
similar similar flags as to regular web

451
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,959
but the dark web

452
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
flags get a thousand points if it's only

453
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,360
available on the dark web so for example

454
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,959
if you've got a facebook page for the

455
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,519
person on the dark web but it also

456
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,839
lives on the regular web it doesn't

457
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
count as dark web accounts as i think

458
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
advanced subject info

459
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
and then location if you can prove that

460
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,880
you know

461
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,519
where the individual is

462
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,959
now

463
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,000
um

464
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
alive or dead

465
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
obituaries don't count unfortunately but

466
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
if you can prove that you know where

467
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
they are then that's what 5000 points

468
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,560
yeah

469
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,800
um a quick uh couple comments about this

470
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,079
uh our this slide here yes last day

471
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,680
scene it's definitely um in recent

472
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
investigations we've had people that

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
posted instagram non-stop about where

474
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
they were going and the trips as they

475
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,680
went so they you know they had posts

476
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,959
about like where they were going on

477
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,199
their last day scene and all that stuff

478
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,600
is really interesting and important

479
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
um these are these points are a lot

480
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,880
harder to get the dark web points

481
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,959
usually every event there's like maybe

482
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
you know 10 of these that are that are

483
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
awarded and the location uh

484
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
points are

485
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
rare every every other event there might

486
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
be somebody awarded with that but it

487
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,639
does happen it has happened in the

488
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,480
events that i've taken part in that you

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
know somebody's got those that location

490
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,119
5000 points there yeah yeah

491
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
all right

492
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,280
tickets i'll talk about tickets so

493
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,959
tickets so every event um they announce

494
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
every event typically through their um

495
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
trace lab ctf twitter account or on

496
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,160
their discord or both all the time

497
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
and depending on the event uh tickets

498
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
sellout they're just twenty dollars

499
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
their nominal fee it takes takes care of

500
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
their hosting and whatever else

501
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
but tickets can sell out very quickly

502
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,480
depending on you know what event i took

503
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,919
part in the

504
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,559
trace subs event at uh defcon last year

505
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
and it's all loaded in four hours

506
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,840
um

507
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
they also uh the first uh batch of

508
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
tickets that traceups provides they also

509
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,880
uh do an osint training discount on

510
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
there that comes with it which is really

511
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,799
great um the first event that we took

512
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
part in i got

513
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,760
an event and jen was very sad regarding

514
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,640
that

515
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,679
um

516
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,360
so after you get the tickets basically

517
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
as i was talking about earlier you could

518
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
set up a team it's pretty easy one

519
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,919
person sets up a team and they send the

520
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,200
invite code

521
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
um and you can have up to four members

522
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
um and the first time that me and jen

523
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,039
took took uh tried was it just how many

524
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,360
people was just me it was just the two

525
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
of us it's the two of us right exactly

526
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
so you can do it by yourself you can do

527
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
it with them you know two people you can

528
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
do with four people

529
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
and of course that varies it definitely

530
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
uh there's a little bit of a learning

531
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,320
curve and just figuring things out but

532
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,160
it is interesting um the scoring

533
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,679
platform is

534
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,080
um yeah it's like you gotta you gotta

535
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,520
look at what's what's worth points it's

536
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
not just you know like go down the

537
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
rabbit hole and that's very easy to do

538
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,840
going down the rabbit hole and looking

539
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,919
for information about somebody and like

540
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,160
oh there's two hours wow you know four

541
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
hours four to six hours goes very

542
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,320
quickly

543
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
yeah it's it's actually worth mentioning

544
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
that in subsequent

545
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,120
ocean competitions and seriousness ctfs

546
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,960
i have been able to get the training and

547
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,799
it's actually worthwhile so

548
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,840
if you're interested in signing up uh

549
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,020
sign up early and you get the training

550
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,480
[Music]

551
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,919
oh

552
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,919
tools prep two uh my tools were

553
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,480
i'm i'm an ocean newbie so

554
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
multiple search engines i heavily relied

555
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
on the michael bizzell books

556
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
youtube darren darren was a really big

557
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
source of info for me

558
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,559
i used sublime to keep all of my notes

559
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,679
uh darren's got all of the tools which

560
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
we've got a

561
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
link to his start me page which i also

562
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
used because darren does this frequently

563
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
um he's a lot better at this than i am

564
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,400
still

565
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
after even after all the practice in the

566
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
last year he's still held a lot better

567
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,400
with this i am so

568
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,200
uh

569
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,039
socks if you're

570
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
familiar with socks

571
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
socks are if you're not familiar with

572
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
box i should say socks stand for stock

573
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
puppet accounts basically if you're

574
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
logging on to facebook to do some recon

575
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,679
on a subject don't you probably don't

576
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,919
want to use your own facebook account if

577
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,480
you have one

578
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
create a

579
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
create a dummy account

580
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
sometimes facebook will get wise to

581
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
what you're doing the algorithm picks up

582
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
that you're poking around and perhaps

583
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
doing things that you shouldn't be doing

584
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
or you know the stalkery behavior and

585
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
they will

586
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
they will ban you

587
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
um going into this i

588
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
really just wanted to learn so i wasn't

589
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,400
being too aggressive

590
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
i did a lot of searching on my own

591
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,559
existing alphabet accounts but i did

592
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,320
manage to create a new

593
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,919
tick tock and a new instagram and a new

594
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,840
facebook account

595
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
um

596
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
i might not

597
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
i might actually not

598
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,159
uh create sock puppets again unless i

599
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,080
was doing a lot of ocean mostly just

600
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
because i'm not super aggressive and i

601
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,280
don't

602
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
i don't i don't really uh

603
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,039
i don't really go down the rabbit hole

604
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,320
i'm kind of all over the place like a

605
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,200
crow

606
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,880
uh darren

607
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
apparently yeah you've you've got a lot

608
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
of passive research socks that you've

609
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,400
had set up in the past yeah i do a lot

610
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,159
of other awesome work so i have some i

611
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,919
have different socks that are they're

612
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,440
passive research stocks are just used

613
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
for research um i also have

614
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,679
non-passive socks that are that have

615
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
personas that um portray a a part that

616
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
uh into that investigation that i'm

617
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
working on so they might be um

618
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,400
oh they might be whoever like depends on

619
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
the investigation right so um um and but

620
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
research talks i i feel that research

621
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
talks are pretty good

622
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
because it means that your your your

623
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
account like you people see when you're

624
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,280
looking at their their profile on

625
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,960
facebook it's you show up as a friend

626
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,919
occasionally if you look at their

627
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
profile enough times right so it's some

628
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,679
of those things so if i'm doing research

629
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,559
you know

630
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
tracelab ctf isn't a huge deal but if

631
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
i'm doing an investigation onto somebody

632
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,720
that's uh doing something bad i really

633
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
don't want my facebook profile photo

634
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,679
with my mug showing up uh as a possible

635
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,640
friend because i've looked at their

636
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
facebook profile six times so i have a

637
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,640
bunch of socks that i've spent time

638
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
setting up that are have personas and

639
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,799
fake names and fake photos

640
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,600
and um so they're gonna see john smith

641
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
or sally smith um has been looked at

642
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,799
their profile maybe and not darren

643
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,120
thurston hardbox um so that's depending

644
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,840
on traceup ctf isn't a huge uh

645
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
you know um

646
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
yeah it's not i'm not worried lots about

647
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,960
opsec on that but um other

648
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
investigations i do

649
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,840
um

650
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
comms so for our back end with our team

651
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,640
we

652
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,600
um

653
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
communication is pretty uh important of

654
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,960
course so we set up a private discord

655
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
server and that's what we use for our

656
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,919
intel communications on during the

657
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,400
during the trace lab ctf and basically

658
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,559
we added added our team to that and we

659
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,320
just did the channel for each missing

660
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
person and it allowed us to basically

661
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
post information and keep track of what

662
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
we were investigating real like as we

663
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
posted you know as we found information

664
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,600
out we posted in the channel just so we

665
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
had a record

666
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
of what we were finding on the uh on

667
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,280
each missing person uh in subsequent uh

668
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
ctfs we've started to use mind map which

669
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
has helped out a lot um jen tell us

670
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
about my maps

671
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
i don't know anybody know what

672
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
microscope yeah yeah my maps are cool

673
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
it's a we use an online

674
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,679
collaborative one so everybody logs in

675
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,039
and

676
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,600
what you can do is you can have

677
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
the if if you're familiar with the mind

678
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
mount the way it goes you

679
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
get like one

680
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
one branch and then you can branch out

681
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,159
into

682
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,760
other branches and then those branches

683
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
can have branches so

684
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,840
for example if you've got subject one

685
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,679
you can put down

686
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,320
uh for the different flag categories and

687
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,080
then under those different flight

688
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
categories you can have

689
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,400
the different flag types and so you can

690
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
have

691
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,520
you know subject one

692
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,159
family mother and then

693
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
mother's facebook and then father

694
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
father's facebook and then

695
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,279
from there you can pivot into

696
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,240
you know father's work or father's

697
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,400
social media that kind of thing it's a

698
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,840
really effective way to have a

699
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,480
visual representation of

700
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,679
what you're still missing and it's also

701
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,400
really

702
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
uh i think we started with discord

703
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,240
and

704
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
it's

705
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,919
good to share info so that you're not

706
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,799
you know so we're not both looking for

707
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,279
the mom for example um

708
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
you can see what someone else had done

709
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,400
in the past in the past for our events

710
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
we've switched switched missing person

711
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,559
every hour or so so we've you know it's

712
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,919
like spent an hour or two on a missing

713
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,520
person and then switched and then you

714
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,799
can see what the other person has found

715
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
already on that missing person which is

716
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
great so we have a reference there

717
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
yeah so

718
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
okay

719
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,039
d-day

720
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
june 26th this is it's almost been a

721
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
year ago

722
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
since our first ekfam yeah uh kickoff

723
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
started at eight o'clock in the morning

724
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
it was a long day

725
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
uh ctf started at nine

726
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,840
so there's an hour of

727
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,240
sort of intros welcomes plays by the

728
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,279
rules

729
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,840
um four subjects to look for on our

730
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
first ctf but there's been between four

731
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
and six other times

732
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,400
um

733
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
worldwide subjects worldwide

734
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,279
participation darren touched on that a

735
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,520
little bit earlier we've had subjects

736
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
from all over the world but you also get

737
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,520
folks from all over the world

738
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
participating as well

739
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
lots of coffee that day

740
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
lots of searching and submitting flags

741
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
and then 4 p.m closing

742
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
the day went by very very quickly

743
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,559
yeah it sure did definitely

744
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,640
okay here we can get an idea of what

745
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,880
this the back end of the trace lab ctf

746
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
uh

747
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
looks like here um so basically when you

748
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
get your people that are missing um you

749
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
get some information it shows you what's

750
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
going on this is sort of the back end of

751
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,559
the ctf

752
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,320
it'll show you um the place they're

753
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
missing from and how many days they've

754
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,320
been missing from and here you can see

755
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,720
um things that we've submitted uh and

756
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
that were rejected

757
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,679
um it shows you a little bit it shows

758
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
you that there's one minute left here so

759
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,520
this was at the end of uh our first ctf

760
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,080
got it um and yes we blanked out their

761
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,399
names

762
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,840
uh and a little bit more here so you can

763
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
see here

764
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,159
if you click on one of them you can see

765
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,760
that that flags that have been submitted

766
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,679
and you can see a couple things here

767
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,600
um cell phone carrier

768
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
oh i'm gonna make that smaller here one

769
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,799
sec there we go uh cell phone carrier um

770
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,320
advanced subject information basics

771
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,159
information social media sites things

772
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,520
like that that we submitted that were

773
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,918
approved

774
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,240
so

775
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
lessons uh

776
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,919
i i'll talk about my lessons and then

777
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,279
i'll hand it over to darren to talk with

778
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,400
his um don't spend too much time on one

779
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,080
subject so

780
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
the first one

781
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
i spent probably

782
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,799
two and a half or three hours out of the

783
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,799
four hours on one person and it

784
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,360
not only do you become less effective

785
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
over time because

786
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,240
you

787
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,720
uh you can lose track of what's going on

788
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
or

789
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,360
um

790
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,600
you can get confused about

791
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,520
what where you actually

792
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,360
you can lose track of where you were or

793
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,960
what thread you were sort of following

794
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,919
um

795
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,960
you the the more time that you spend on

796
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,200
an individual the less objectivity you

797
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,240
have

798
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,960
so

799
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,679
for me it was my first time i got really

800
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,600
emotionally invested in this missing

801
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,120
girl and

802
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
i

803
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,760
felt

804
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
the i felt the emotional impact probably

805
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,039
for

806
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,440
a day or two afterwards i was a bang of

807
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,559
hammers

808
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,760
that night

809
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
um and then the next day as well it was

810
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,840
not only very tired but it was just very

811
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,720
very very sad these are you know missing

812
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
people um real humans

813
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,559
yeah

814
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,640
the other thing is you want to document

815
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,000
absolutely everything uh particularly

816
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
if you

817
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,279
if you're submitting a bunch of flags

818
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,360
you really want to make sure that you

819
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,279
document everything figure out how you

820
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
found something figure out

821
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,679
why you think something is important

822
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,080
and then if you document it your

823
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
you can go back afterwards and take a

824
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,799
look at it and you can share that

825
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,399
information with your team

826
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,440
perhaps if uh if you've documented it

827
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
perhaps they can pick up a thread and

828
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
run without one

829
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,039
um the then i might i'm still in the

830
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,039
fence about using a screen recorder

831
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,600
uh your frequently it's just there's

832
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
such a short period of time

833
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,520
um i don't know if i would use a screen

834
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
recorder for a ctf but if i was doing

835
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
this professionally i might do that

836
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
take breaks regularly

837
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,440
and

838
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,399
yeah mind mapping definitely makes sense

839
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,600
yeah there is software for screen

840
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,279
recording which works great especially

841
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
for longer term investigations it's

842
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
important i think it works well for

843
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,480
different things you can actually you

844
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,279
know it's like because you don't

845
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,120
remember everything after a week or two

846
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,960
i'm like oh what did i see on this day

847
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
etc etc um and just a note on uh

848
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
emotional impact um yeah um it's um

849
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,039
you're you're it's a little rough you're

850
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
dealing with people that are missing um

851
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
there are some really sad cases every

852
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,600
event um you know yeah there's um

853
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,399
there's definitely real real and it

854
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,640
um you feel it um you might think you

855
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
don't but you will

856
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,360
yeah

857
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
um definitely it's important for

858
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,480
decompression after the event is really

859
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,919
important to even during the event take

860
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
some breaks half walk around the

861
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,279
house get some fresh air for a second

862
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,600
whatever it's important um it is you

863
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
know you think it's not stressful but

864
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
it's amazing actually how

865
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
how quick four hours go and how

866
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
stressful it is it's interesting um so

867
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,720
some uh some notes about um the ctf um

868
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
review the point system details as much

869
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,039
as you can they're important um and this

870
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,679
is a ctf well it is real world but those

871
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,279
points are important so you could go

872
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,640
down the rabbit hole for an hour or two

873
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,240
and and find one flag or two flags but

874
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
so paying attention to those what the

875
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,440
what you get points for is important and

876
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
and um and submitting submitting

877
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
submitting submitting so

878
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
after you

879
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,159
your team submits their their first

880
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,799
submission um you'll be uh judge will be

881
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,760
selected for you and typically our team

882
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
would like to now after we've done a

883
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,039
submission and you get assigned a judge

884
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
is to go over to discord and you start a

885
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,200
little chat with our team and our judge

886
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
so you can check in with the judge and

887
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
it helps a lot

888
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,279
um it allows you to ask questions if

889
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
they if they deny you a flag or

890
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,559
something like that you can ask you can

891
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
ask them why and and it's helped us a

892
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,000
lot in them in the past it's definitely

893
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
a really good thing to do

894
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,880
um

895
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,640
coordinating with your team members so

896
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
typically in the past four four hour

897
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,159
events we've

898
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,520
checked in at the start had a voice

899
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,360
check-in and then every hour we've had a

900
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
voice check-in and typically then maybe

901
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
switch subjects switch to a new subject

902
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,159
or if somebody's doing really great and

903
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,640
uh digging into something then you know

904
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,760
one person one team member will work on

905
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
a missing person for two hours or

906
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,840
something but and rotate a little bit

907
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
that helps things definitely

908
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,679
um so document document document the

909
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,159
mind map works worked great and we've

910
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,760
used that more in the last couple events

911
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
because you can see everything all at

912
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
once on one page it works really well

913
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,519
um you can put links in you can put

914
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,440
photos in you can do whatever i've liked

915
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,600
that lots it's helped it's a good good

916
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,919
way we've found out

917
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,240
yeah

918
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,519
i'm okay of the tools we like to use

919
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,880
these are just some we'll make these

920
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480

922
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
earlier in the chat but um a couple of

923
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,880
my my favorite tools here

924
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,320
uh epis mail checker which is great um

925
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,240

926
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,159
google and you can put in an email

927
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,799
um and even if it's not a gmail account

928
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,000

um if you've done a whole bunch of

935

lot of those are public most of those

937
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
are public and it's very easy to see

938
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,760

big framework and has a lot of links on

967
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
it it's a very good place to go to just

968
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,840
to look um do some research for when

969
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,360
you're looking at hosting techniques

970
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,679
um multiple search engines so yeah not

971
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,360
just google not just bing

972
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,720

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,599
tool it's written in python it's awesome

1008
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,480
um

1009
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,280
so i run linux it does run on mac uh

1010
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,320
windows i'm not really sure um but it is

1011
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,159
really nice um it allows you it has a

1012
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,440
really nice interface that allows you to

1013
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,560
run searches

1014
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,440
on user names domain names ip addresses

1015
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,159
all kinds of things it does require

1016
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,880
um to be really useful it does require

1017
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,440
some api access um a lot of you know

1018
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,119
different uis that uses a lot of

1019
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,320
different um

1020
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,640
most those apis are a lot of them are

1021
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
free not all of them um but i do have

1022
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,520
about

1023
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,079
30 apis on my spider foot

1024
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,079
and they are um

1025
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,240
you know those ones are all free um it

1026
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,920
provides you great results i do run it

1027
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,839
and typically run my usernames or run

1028
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,560
email addresses on it also during the

1029
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,480
during the tracelab ctf i also use it

1030
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
for other uh investigations a lot it's a

1031
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
great tool and they are doing spiderfoot

1032
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,640
team is great they're adding more and

1033
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,720
more modules all the time it's really

1034
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,079
powerful tool and it's getting better

1035
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,200
and better as time goes on

1036
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
okay um this is uh you can see a little

1037
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
bit of interface

1038
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,200
on spiderfoot and

1039
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,119
these were some usernames i searched on

1040
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,960
for a tracelab ctf

1041
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,800
and you can see it was uh

1042
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
something uh m redacted

1043
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,880
fin

1044
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,680
and that provided me a bunch of accounts

1045
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
um which were very interesting this was

1046
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
a this was a teenager that was missing

1047
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,760
and um they had accounts on tinder

1048
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
and they had venmo and cash app accounts

1049
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
so that was very interesting results

1050
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,240
um

1051
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,400
okay so flags okay let you judge him

1052
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,560
rags yeah so

1053
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,000
a lot of times you'll find flags in news

1054
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,320
stories unfortunately

1055
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
you can't use news stories for

1056
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,079
for submission it's uh it's

1057
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,880
yeah no no no stories uh but what you

1058
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,400
can do is take that information and

1059
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,880
use it for things like employment flags

1060
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
uh one point

1061
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,079
um i think i was researching someone who

1062
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,119
the

1063
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,280
the news story called out that the the

1064
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
subject worked at a specific place so

1065
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,079
went over to

1066
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,240
the the company's website and was

1067
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,160
actually able to download a a photo in

1068
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,000
an actual um

1069
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,800
a screen cap of their info on like the

1070
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,480
about us page

1071
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,280
uh

1072
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
also leads to friendly

1073
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,760
family and friends flags names photos

1074
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
employment

1075
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,760
um hobbies as well there have been

1076
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,640
you know news stories that have

1077
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,680
uh the folks in the uniform for

1078
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,119
a band which

1079
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,720
you know will give them

1080
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,520
give

1081
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,760
give the the school as well as some of

1082
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,880
their hobbies

1083
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,000
um

1084
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,599
multiple flags from one username

1085
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
obviously we saw that in spider foot

1086
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
um

1087
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,760
focus on the higher points flags for

1088
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,400
example the cell phone type and carrier

1089
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
and make sure that you know what the

1090
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,119
flags are before you go in

1091
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,520
uh the first couple of times

1092
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,560
running through i completely forgot that

1093
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
some things were worth more than others

1094
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,359
and so i got stuck on looking at friends

1095
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,720
when i could be actually getting

1096
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,880
advanced subject info

1097
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,920
and then

1098
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
submitting things that way too

1099
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,320
um expect to have some of your flags get

1100
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,520
rejected

1101
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
either as duplicates or just as not

1102
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,640
enough information or

1103
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,599
questionable uh if you can't if you need

1104
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,200
to get a subscription or if it's behind

1105
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,599
some kind of a paywall it doesn't count

1106
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,720
you can't

1107
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,640
it'll that'll get rejected for sure talk

1108
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,200
to your judge uh these folks are often

1109
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,599
really good really senior members of the

1110
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,440
community they know what they're doing

1111
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,640
they know what they're looking for um

1112
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,800
they're here to help they can guide you

1113
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
in the right way

1114
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,960
and then be like ross you want to pivot

1115
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,280
uh what does that mean well

1116
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,119
like i say the news story you get a

1117
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,119
photo um

1118
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,560
you might see a high school in the

1119
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
background

1120
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,720
you so you get the school you uh if you

1121
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,560
see a

1122
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
a photo of a couple folks together and

1123
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,280
you see something in uh in the

1124
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,040
background then leaning against a car or

1125
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,720
something like that you'll be able to

1126
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,680
pivot to the type of car the make model

1127
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,720
um

1128
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,119
every every piece of information can

1129
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,680
potentially leave to lead to another

1130
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
piece of information yeah school website

1131
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,400
you name it all kinds of things and yeah

1132
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,960
you got it

1133
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,800
okay here you get an idea of how crazy

1134
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
things get

1135
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
i'm gonna make that bigger so i can see

1136
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,640
it okay so here um you can see this is

1137
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
uh this is the end of our first event

1138
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
and you can get an idea of how many uh

1139
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,160
how many things were submitted um

1140
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,720
there's 425 contestants four cases four

1141
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,440
missing people 240 teams

1142
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,760
100 judges and by the way those judges

1143
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,119
not only are they awesome they're

1144
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,560
volunteering

1145
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,119
so yeah be nice to your judges too

1146
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,040
they're they're working hard exactly

1147
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,359
working hard and uh you got it

1148
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
so um you can get an idea here first

1149
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,760
place here uh federal bureau of oceans

1150
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,119
um and they had 149 submissions

1151
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,839
um for 10 495 points pretty damn crazy

1152
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,119
exactly um and as you can see you'll see

1153
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,240
the score here that's they're at the

1154
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,760
very top here and they took off they've

1155
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
got some a lot of points and the top 10

1156
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
teams here all are

1157
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,440
pretty experienced those in people

1158
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,359
they've been they typically take place

1159
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,640
uh and take part in the traceup ctf most

1160
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,200
events um a lot of them probably

1161
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
some of them a lot of them i think have

1162
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,680
uh

1163
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,760
jobs in ocean definitely they're skilled

1164
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,040
um but you get an idea of how many

1165
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,079
submissions they're submitting and

1166
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,079
that's the submissions i believe these

1167
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,040
are submissions that were approved so

1168
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,560
this probably i don't think believe this

1169
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
shows the submissions that were rejected

1170
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,280
so you get an idea of that

1171
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,400
there's a question in the chat darren um

1172
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
have you been able to

1173
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,319
be successful in helping to find the

1174
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,599
missing people

1175
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,119
um the answer to that is we don't know

1176
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,359
uh submit the flags the flags go to law

1177
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,440
enforcement and then that's it

1178
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,119
that's the end of uh that is the end of

1179
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,480
the investigation

1180
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,000
yeah it's and it's one of those things

1181
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
too it's just like you know it's you

1182
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,280
know we're not then that's why we have

1183
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
our thing our slides redacted and things

1184
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
like that we we not you know these are

1185
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,040
real people in investigations uh i hope

1186
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,560
it has and i don't know for sure you

1187
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,839
know we don't get any feedback from

1188
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,440
trace labs ctf and i don't expect

1189
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
anything of course you know we'd like to

1190
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
know but it's one of those things i hope

1191
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,640
that you know they've found some missing

1192
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,119
people but we don't really know um for

1193
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,640
sure yeah you got it

1194
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,240
hmm

1195
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,760
here's some numbers uh this was i think

1196
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,160
elite does say that only the accepted

1197
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
submissions show on that view thanks

1198
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,079

back uh we had 425 contestants and 240

1206

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,400
submissions

1208

uh 2000 of the almost 2 000 of those

1209
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,119

1210
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,119

and how many things are submitted yeah

1228

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,119
uh trace lab oscp vouchers which are uh

1233
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,880
worth a couple thousand dollars actually

1234

subscriptions uh hunchley licenses

1236
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,200
hunchley's an awesome uh ocean piece of

1237
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,640
software that does uh screen sharing and

1238
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
uh screen recording and things like that

1239
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,240
it's not screen sharing screen recording

1240
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
really nice piece of software really

1241
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,560
good for ocean investigations overall

1242
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,440
uh

1243
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,520
pack the box subscriptions spider foot

1244
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,400
uh licenses uh subscriptions which are

1245
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,240
also awesome

1246
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,640
and so we get a there's typically every

1247
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,240
event there's a first second and third

1248
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,160
place and then there's also the mvo

1249
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,920
winner and that is basically the most

1250
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,359
valuable uh submission and every uh

1251
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,960
every event that's typically it's

1252
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
awarded to a team that provides the most

1253
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,720
insightful sort of uh submission and uh

1254
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,440
in different events that's been um

1255
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
submissions regarding like

1256
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,760
one of them was a geo i think a

1257
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,440
geolocated uh

1258
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,599
subject to last day or things like that

1259
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,440
um they're basically

1260
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,040
submissions that were uh you know well

1261
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,880
thought and definitely probably unique

1262
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,800
to a lot of or most of the other uh

1263
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
submissions that we receive for each uh

1264
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,440
each tracelab ctf you've got it most

1265
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
valuable ocean you've got it yeah

1266
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,920
and yeah tracelabs is from vancouver um

1267
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,880
and um we um there yeah it's from

1268
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,480
vancouver and we they're good people

1269
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,400
definitely they've uh yeah they've

1270
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,440
sponsored besides in the past

1271
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,400
so

1272
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
this is how we did in our first event uh

1273
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,240
seventh out of 240

1274
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,800
yeah so this is weird 29 submissions

1275
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,520
1910 points nothing compared to the top

1276
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,119
10 teams but

1277
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,800
we i was pretty happy with it i think

1278
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,240
jeff was pretty good

1279
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,119
yeah

1280
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,480
yeah 29 submissions got uh 1900 points

1281
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,280
and yeah yeah definitely pretty happy

1282
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,800
with that i've done

1283
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,240
uh i think most of our events we've

1284
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,480
placed in the top about 30 to 40 uh

1285
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,720
teams um i one i did by myself at def

1286
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,880
con i placed in the top 30 which was

1287
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,280
awesome um and so yeah it's been pretty

1288
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,200
happy with those results so what you're

1289

it

1297
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,400

again

1306
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,720
ocean framework the sans sounds blog on

1307
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,000
ocean

1308
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
github on search party write-ups that's

1309
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,040
actually one thing that we forgot um

1310
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,960
yeah looking at other people's write-ups

1311
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,200
is really handy

1312
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,800
that was it's been a lot of fun and then

1313
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,720
the ocean map

1314
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,119
um i think i actually want to update

1315
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,200
this to include

1316
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,240
uh rechews resources while i took a look

1317
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,440
after

1318
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,079
the presentation this morning and it's

1319
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,440
i think they're worth including in here

1320
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,520
so there's a there's a lot of resources

1321
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,200
we could have 10 slides but yeah there's

1322
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,640
some some of these will get you some

1323
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,280
good places you got it that's for sure

1324
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,319

next traceup ctf will be in uh this

1334
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,720
summer exactly at defcon 30. you got

1335
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
that's what i figured thanks elise

1336
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,520
that's awesome to know

1337
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,720
you got it

1338
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,280
and then tim is asking if there's any

1339
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,040
crossover between trace labs and orgs

1340
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,119
like bellingcat i can't answer that

1341
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,319
because they don't know what bellingcat

1342
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,160
is um there is not that i know of but

1343
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,520
i'm i'm sure some people uh from

1344
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,839
bellingham might take part in tracelabs

1345
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,680
ctf but no there's no crossover as far

1346
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,440
as i know um there are some other

1347
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
missing people uh

1348
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,599
uh ctfs out there in other countries a

1349
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,280
couple others um

1350
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,880
and um i can't remember their names

1351
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,280
right now but tracelabs is the biggest

1352
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,880
and has been around the longest and is

1353
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,800
pretty international i know their last

1354
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,560
event they actually moved it from a

1355
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,480
morning event to an afternoon event to

1356
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,280
uh

1357
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,960
basically get more people from australia

1358
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,680
involved and a lot of uh australians got

1359
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,319
involved on the on the investigation

1360
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,839
side and there was also they added i

1361
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,760
think there was two or three missing

1362
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,520
people from australia we had six missing

1363
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,000
people all together two australians or

1364
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,520
one new zealander

1365
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,599
so it was interesting um a lot of and

1366
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,440
it's interesting because

1367
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,640
people from the united states are really

1368
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,839
easy to find there's a lot of

1369
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,079
information available typically but

1370
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,559
people from canada aren't we we have a

1371
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,839
lot of we have really good privacy laws

1372
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,119
in canada

1373
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,599
and people from the uk and australia and

1374
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,640
other countries definitely have

1375
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,960
different uh differences harder and

1376
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,400
easier to find from different countries

1377
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,319
right and so it's interesting to brush

1378
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,920
up on those skills and try and find

1379
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,440
different people from different places

1380
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,960
uh how does ocean map compare to

1381
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,880
obsidian uh if you mean obsidian the

1382
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,040
the note-taking tool yes um

1383
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,839
i think that they're

1384
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:00,720
oh

1385
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,559
i haven't explored obsidian enough to

1386
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
know whether or not there's a mind map

1387
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,880
tool

1388
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,640
i believe there is i haven't played

1389
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
without obsidian a lot um i know that a

1390
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,880
lot of osun people are really uh pushing

1391
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,800
uh really happy with obsidian i've tried

1392
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,160
it a little bit

1393
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
um we could yeah i like the mind map

1394
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,839
because it's one

1395
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,520
one view and we can do a share with all

1396
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,359
the team members obsidian might be a

1397
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,559
little overkill for a four hour ctf but

1398
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,359
obsidian is like awesome

1399
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,760
but it might be a lot for just um for a

1400
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,000
four hour ctf

1401
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,680
yeah actually just since you still have

1402
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,440
seen a couple days ago so

1403
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,280
i haven't explored its full potential

1404
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,000
yet okay so i think we got a couple more

1405
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,359
questions i'm gonna so that's our

1406
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,200
contact information and then we have

1407
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,118
yeah exactly uh thank

1408
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,359
does you have questions

1409
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,040
yeah i'm gonna see here i'm just looking

1410
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,160
um

1411
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,000
all right let me look over here

1412
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,480
okay

1413
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,000
uh just checking up here

1414
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,400
okay

1415
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,319
you know what questions there okay one

1416
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,880
over there let's see web breacher yeah

1417
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,680
obsidian awesome jim you got it

1418
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,359
yeah good stuff yeah it is good it's

1419
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,559
pretty powerful it's pretty awesome i

1420
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,319
like obsidian and there is a it does

1421
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,440
take a little bit of a learning curve

1422
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,960
but it's pretty awesome for uh

1423
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,960
investigations and and note-taking it's

1424
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,559
pretty there's a lot of plug-ins in

1425
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,960
every different fun stuff with it i

1426
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,400
think it might be a little bit overkill

1427
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,480
for a four-hour ctf but it's pretty neat

1428
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,440
so if there's no other questions

1429
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,119
