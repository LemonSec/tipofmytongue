1
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,560
hello everyone how are you doing today

2
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,199
pretty quiet lunch is setting in I think

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,240
this is actually My First Security

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,940
conference and thank you

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,980
I think these size has set the bar very

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,960
high with this view I think it's all

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,040
downhill from here this is so beautiful

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,719
but my name is Raquel Eisman I'm a

9
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,420
security advisor at soteria a cyber

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,000
security firm based out of Charleston

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
and today I'm going to present one of

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,600
our community version tools 365 inspect

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,699
this is a tool that enables auto

14
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,640
inspection of the Microsoft environment

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,920
to look for vulnerabilities and provide

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
recommendations for remediation

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,260
I came to soteria from an I.T operations

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,320
role and when I learned about this tool

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
they were developing I thought two

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,380
things

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,840
first I really wanted to be a part of

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,520
the team that was developing this

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,280
software I thought it was really neat

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,259
and second I thought

25
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,320
man this tool would have been so nice to

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,600
have all of those years as an admin

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
managing 365 tenants

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,659
talk a little a little more

29
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,700
so over the past few months I've been

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,619
working with the development team to

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,840
help shape and test this software

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,159
and when we learned there was an

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,900
opportunity to speak with you all today

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,040
we thought uh 365 inspect would be great

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,439
to go over with the b-sides community in

36
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,600
case it can help one of you or someone

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,579
you know strengthen your Microsoft

38
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,119
environment

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,740
so today I'm going to go over the makeup

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,100
of the tool it's benefits I'll do a

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,960
short demonstration video on how to use

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,220
the tool

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,199
and we'll look at some of the types of

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,660
vulnerabilities on it uncovers and at

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,099
the end I'll open it up to any questions

46
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,760
you may have

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,640
so before I get into the tool itself I

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,660
wanted to give a little bit of

49
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,340
background as to why we started

50
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,319
developing this software

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,300
so Microsoft is one of the leading

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,060
collaboration tenants in the market and

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,220
it's often prone to misconfigurations

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,800
due to the sheer number of security

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
settings

56
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,940
so leading collaborator

57
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,519
large volume of security settings

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,819
this is a treasure Trove for attackers

59
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,519
if I'm an attacker and I can develop an

60
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,739
exploit that's going to successfully

61
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,280
breach 70 percent of companies versus an

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
exploit that's only going to breach 30

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,180
percent of companies because they're

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,280
utilizing different platforms

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
you better believe I'm going to see how

66
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
many birds I can get with this one stone

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,739
and so soteria realized that they were

68
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,040
seeing the same type of incidents over

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,580
all Industries for all of their clients

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,379
repeatedly occurring

71
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,500
and not only that they realized that

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,120
there were limited resources available

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,940
to the public that provided no cost

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,640
assessments of these environments

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,860
which is why soteria began developing

76
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,780
365 inspect

77
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,420
to assist organizations proactively

78
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,060
identify these issues and help them

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,200
mitigate their risk

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,860
365 inspect is an open source software

81
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,319
available to everyone on GitHub you

82
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,299
could download it and run it today in a

83
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,519
matter of minutes

84
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,819
you run one Powershell command and it

85
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,220
executes a set of inspectors

86
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,799
and an inspector is just our fancy name

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,500
for a Powershell script

88
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,140
there's 85 inspectors that query the

89
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,659
tenants for misconfigurations in

90
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,659
SharePoint Azure exchange and there's

91
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,860
more

92
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,720
and these inspectors are looking for

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,860
things like

94
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,620
how many Global administrators do you

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,959
have enabled in your tenant

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,600
which mailboxes have external forwarding

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,100
rules set on them

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,320
do you have a policy that blocks

99
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,360
malicious attachments

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,300
and I know what you're all thinking

101
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,680
Raquel these are not groundbreaking

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,220
vulnerabilities and we know that these

103
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,860
are simple settings that many companies

104
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,020
are missing the mark on

105
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,500
thus leading them open to attackers

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,520
exploiting them

107
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,919
how many inspectors are run into your

108
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,139
environment is dependent on your tenant

109
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,479
license level so for instance if you do

110
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,940
not have InTune setup the findings are

111
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,040
not going to return any negative InTune

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,300
values

113
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,419
and then at the end you'll be provided

114
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,060
with a report that's easy to read easy

115
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,520
to understand that anyone can pick up

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
and understand where the vulnerabilities

117
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
are and how to remediate them

118
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,120
the tool usually takes less than an hour

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
to run it's dependent on the size of

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,419
your environment

121
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,940
so if you have 10 users it may take a

122
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,820
couple minutes if you have 10 000 users

123
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,259
in mailboxes it may take a couple hours

124
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,600
it does not make any changes within the

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,759
environment it's simply pulling

126
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,360
information to provide you with a report

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,440
the report can be in Json HTML CSV

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,840
whatever helps you best track your

129
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,180
remediation steps

130
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,479
and my personal favorite part is that it

131
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
doesn't just give you a list of problems

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,160
and say all right here's your findings

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,460
go fix these it gives you curated steps

134
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,659
to resolve each one

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,680
so before running the tool you'll need

136
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,800
three key items the first is a account

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,780
enabled with the global and SharePoint

138
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,120
administrator roles

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
this is due to the permissions that

140
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,139
you'll need to query the tenant

141
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,759
next you'll need the tenant or

142
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,039
organizational name

143
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,020
and lastly you'll need to install a

144
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,419
couple of Powershell modules and these

145
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,039
modules ensure that you can connect to

146
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,060
the Microsoft services

147
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,139
I know I mentioned three but if you do

148
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,819
run this you may want to get it

149
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,060
permission beforehand before just real

150
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,560
willy-nilly running it in your

151
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,039
environment

152
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,960
so I mentioned the tool is easy to use

153
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,759
and I want to demonstrate that with the

154
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,039
video

155
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,360
just to note this video is fast

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,039
forwarded a bit so I'm going to try not

157
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,199
to sound like an auctioneer

158
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,240
but I do want to note that the video is

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
not cut in any way

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,660
I wanted to show the entire process of

161
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,580
running the tool from start to finish

162
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,720
okay so to navigate to The Tool we're

163
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,240
going to go to GitHub and type in 365

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,840
inspect

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,280
you want to select the soteria security

166
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
repo

167
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,680
and first we want to set up our

168
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,539
Powershell environment to run the tool

169
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,819
successfully so we're going to run

170
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,380
Powershell as an administrator

171
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,758
and we need to set our execution policy

172
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,580
and next we want to go back to GitHub

173
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,039
and we're going to grab those install

174
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,020
modules that I talked about earlier in

175
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,039
the pre-buck slide

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,520
and while those are installing

177
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,800
we can go back and download the tool zip

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
folder

179
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,000
so we can navigate back to GitHub select

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,560
code and download zip

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,919
code

182
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
once we're back in file explorer we want

183
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,280
to extract all the contents of the

184
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,638
folder

185
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,500
I'm gonna move it to our C drive

186
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,740
now we can navigate back to the terminal

187
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,060
and locate the folder

188
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,720
now we want to go back to GitHub

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
underneath the usage section

190
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,279
and we're going to copy the execution

191
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,880
script

192
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,380
we'll paste that in the terminal

193
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,240
and before we can run it we need to make

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
a few adjustments

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,300
so the first thing we're going to change

196
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,640
is the authentication type we're going

197
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,680
to set that to MFA because that's what

198
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,060
we have enabled on our Global

199
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,459
administrator account this is extremely

200
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,500
important due to the high level of

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,380
privileges that are on the account

202
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,060
and next down here you can see we're

203
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,279
setting our user principal name this is

204
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,260
the user account of the global

205
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,820
administrator

206
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,120
role that we have assigned

207
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,060
for the output path we want to put in

208
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,339
the path that we would like the report

209
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,100
to reside in at the end so for this

210
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,899
example we've just made a folder called

211
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,540
report off the C drive

212
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,279
and lastly you need to put in that

213
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,820
organizational name which is often just

214
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,740
the domain name of the email address

215
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,260
that you put in earlier

216
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,120
a number off and running we started

217
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,700
installing making sure all those modules

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,800
are good those are going through

219
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,880
and you're going to be prompted for

220
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,519
those global administrator credentials

221
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,560
each time you're connecting to a module

222
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,420
so we're putting in our username our

223
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,680
password

224
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,440
our MFA prompt you may see that there's

225
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,540
an error here we did put that in on

226
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,279
purpose I promise there's nothing wrong

227
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,320
with it we just wanted to show that if

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,019
it has an issue connecting to any of the

229
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,320
modules the report's still going to run

230
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,760
and at the end there is an error log

231
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
that you can help you troubleshoot if

232
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,040
you do need any support

233
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
so we've connected to Azure exchange we

234
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,720
have InTune it's going to show you the

235
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,839
permissions that it needs to connect

236
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,279
and lastly it's going to go through

237
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,079
Microsoft graph

238
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,120
by now it's just an easy click with our

239
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,000
credentials to log in

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,620
and now we've started in running those

241
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,120
inspectors that we were talking about

242
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,160
and it gives you the inspector name of

243
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,420
each one

244
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,459
this is a pretty small tenant so it

245
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,200
doesn't take that long a couple minutes

246
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,180
it's already asking you would you like

247
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,220
to disconnect your session yes we would

248
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,600
today because we're not going to run the

249
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,060
report again

250
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,040
and it's done now we can take a look at

251
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,720
the report

252
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,339
so we're going to go back to that output

253
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,980
graph we designated off the C drive

254
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,680
called report we can take a look

255
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,680
we're going to hit our HTML file

256
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,720
it's kind of hard to see but

257
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,240
this is our end product which is it

258
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,220
shows all the inspectors that were run

259
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,260
all 85 of them

260
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,260
and out of the 85 inspectors which ones

261
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,540
pulled vulnerabilities so this is our

262
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,279
test tenant that we have set up with a

263
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,320
couple findings in it it shows that

264
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,660
there were 34 vulnerabilities found out

265
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,300
of the 85 and these are all sorted by

266
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,319
their inherent risk

267
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,279
I just want to jump into one of these

268
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,980
findings here to show that each one has

269
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,140
clickable links with reference guides

270
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,279
and these guides could be blogs

271
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,839
step-by-step tutorials

272
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,180
additional guidance from Microsoft on

273
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,920
how to remediate these findings

274
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
and that's true for all of the findings

275
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,100
here they each have clickable links

276
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,779
and one last thing I wanted to show in

277
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,579
the video before we jump into one of the

278
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,500
findings a little deeper

279
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,660
is that it also provides you with text

280
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,480
files with additional information for

281
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,060
each finding so in this case we have

282
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,180
some external access policies

283
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,560
that were separated out

284
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,720
here we have an example of one of the

285
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,940
findings you may see in a report and in

286
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,800
this case it's an improper number of

287
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,720
global administrators

288
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,120
we see the returned value which is the

289
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,279
eight user accounts that halves has this

290
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,500
permission assigned

291
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,779
a description as to why this is an

292
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,540
insecure practice so in this case more

293
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,399
administrators equals more attack

294
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,440
surface

295
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,779
the default value which in this case

296
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,440
Microsoft has set to One account

297
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,139
the expected value which best practice

298
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,779
dictates setting this threshold between

299
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,880
two to four users depending on the size

300
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,339
of your environment

301
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,680
I wanted to pause here to note that the

302
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,260
default value and expected value were

303
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,420
not originally in the report that

304
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,180
soteria created these were contributions

305
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,100
from GitHub members of the community

306
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,399
that soteria thought were awesome they

307
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,680
tested and put it into the report I

308
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,920
thought that was pretty neat to share

309
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,019
it also has the inherent risk of the

310
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,720
findings so if there are no controls put

311
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,579
into place to mitigate this

312
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,220
vulnerability what is the natural risk

313
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,779
of the finding

314
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,480
and risk ratings in this case range from

315
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,980
informational to critical

316
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
the remediation steps

317
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,000
which for an improper number of global

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,339
administrators is for the business to

319
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,560
review the number of counts and

320
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,540
determine which should continue in this

321
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,060
role and which should be removed keeping

322
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,639
least privilege in mind

323
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,240
and maybe you decide that

324
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,100
you need 10 Global administrators to run

325
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,839
your organization you want to accept

326
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,480
that risk that's up to your discretion

327
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,000
as to how you proceed

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
and the next time you run the report

329
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
there is an exclude flag you can put in

330
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,079
to remove this inspector so you don't

331
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,519
see it in the report next time

332
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,920
and lastly like we went over in the

333
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,720
video there are some reference links

334
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,160
that may provide you with additional

335
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,439
guidance as to how to remedy these steps

336
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,260
on the next example here I wanted to

337
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,000
show one of those text files that we

338
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
covered in the video

339
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,199
so for this finding we're looking at

340
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,000
mailboxes with forwarding rules to

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,160
external recipients

342
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,320
and it says to see an Associated text

343
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,440
file with more information

344
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,360
and we didn't want to just list all of

345
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,339
the rules in each report because that

346
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,139
can get a little bit messy so we've

347
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,699
separated it out

348
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,820
and here we can see the mailbox the

349
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,160
world name and the external recipient

350
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,180
it's forwarding to

351
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,260
and on our last example slide here I

352
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,600
just wanted to show a remediation that

353
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,820
has actual step-by-step guidance in it

354
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,860
it's a little hard but it's saying to

355
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,740
click through to threat management and

356
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,920
turn on a policy to block malicious

357
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
attachments

358
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,160
and so anytime there's a remediation

359
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,800
step that's between two to four steps we

360
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,079
put it right into the report if it's a

361
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,820
more lengthy process that's when you

362
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,360
would go to the references section here

363
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,220
foreign

364
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,680
the feedback we've received from members

365
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,079
of the GitHub community and our clients

366
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,019
has been immensely positive and so we

367
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,600
wanted to share this tool to help get

368
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
the word out

369
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,160
as I was going through the slides if you

370
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,800
were thinking man I have a really good

371
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,560
idea for an inspector or a way to

372
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,240
improve the tool

373
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,300
download it customize it

374
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,639
or contact us and let us know your

375
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,519
thoughts we do have a contribution

376
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
guideline link on the GitHub site if

377
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,760
you'd like to make any inspectors or try

378
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,380
to change the tool we're open to any

379
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,240
ideas

380
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,240
this is a living community tool that we

381
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,199
hope you make your own

382
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,199
are there any questions
