1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,480
protection with deception Inception

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,839
awesome thanks so much

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,580
thank you everyone for being here I'm

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,440
excited to give this talk this is

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,320
actually the fifth talk of 2022 I've

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,120
been giving with slight variation so

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
hopefully this is the best version so

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,260
I'm Justin Varner the best way to

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,840
describe what I do is philosophize about

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
security so I think about security

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,060
problems and I try to post Solutions

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,980
I've been partnered with thinks Canary

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,679
out of Cape Town South Africa they're a

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,960
relatively new company and they work on

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,940
breach detection they provide a free

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,640
service called canarytokens.org and I'm

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,460
going to talk to you about what we've

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,079
been doing in brief detection that isn't

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,840
working why we need a paradigm shift and

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,180
walk you through a ton of practical

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,120
examples for how you can deploy

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,460
deception technology right now so that

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,800
you don't get pwned

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,440
so it would help to first talk about

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,140
honey pots honey tokens and honey traps

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,960
a hunting trap can be a honey pot or a

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,159
honey token

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,920
this is really part of the discipline

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,500
known as deception technology and the

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,240
key with deception technology is

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,479
trickery and being more slick than the

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,580
adversary if you can out dupe your

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,080
adversary you're going to be effective

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,780
at detecting breaches

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,700
um the reason we need honey traps honey

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,979
tokens honey boxes because we need a

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,460
better level of High Fidelity low volume

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
alerts we have analysts that are looking

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,220
through Sims and soars and burned out

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,320
their changing careers we're already at

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,700
a deficit of several million jobs

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,799
depending on which report you read and

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,360
we need a new solution because I feel

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,780
for the analysts and they need some help

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,700
and most importantly what we're doing

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,560
for breaches Now isn't working you know

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,180
it takes a long time and I'll get into

48
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,040
the statistics here shortly to even

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
detect the breach let alone mitigated

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,380
reach it's costing lots of money and

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,600
simple incidents should just stay

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,979
incidents but they're becoming

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,740
catastrophes and we need a new way to

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,439
lower our mean time to detection and

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,179
mitigate the blast radius and like I

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,860
said keep our Security Professionals

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,180
happy and within the same industry

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,040
so some of you may remember laundry room

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,739
biking and this is an analogy to people

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,060
in

61
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,060
the security analyst world you know the

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,980
whole philosophy was you should just

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,260
stay up all night triage alerts nothing

64
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,420
wrong with 100 Hour Week

65
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,660
um but it's not sustainable right so

66
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,340
this isn't going to work and you're

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,599
going to be fighting an uphill battle

68
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,020
this is a metaphor for your inundation

69
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,080
of alerts when um you're told hey go go

70
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,440
take a look at the uh the Splunk Sim and

71
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,540
try to find a needle in the haystack

72
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,180
good luck with that

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,099
but why why do we need deception

74
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,019
technology of all things for grease

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,200
detection well I'll tell you why we need

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,180
something else just look at the past 10

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,879
years you can go back to Snowden in

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,760
2013. most sophisticated

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,580
spy surveillance agency in the world had

80
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,519
no idea that he was rummaging around and

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,040
exfiltrated all this data

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,800
um you know you look at the mo you know

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,599
most people still have post-traumatic

84
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,140
solarwinds disorder PTSD if you go back

85
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,440
to 2019 everything now is third party

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,980
risk and how do we mitigate supply chain

87
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,659
uh we're still feeling the effects there

88
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,819
may be 18 000 or so departments that

89
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,099
have been affected by solarwinds and the

90
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,319
effects are still being felt you know if

91
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,420
you look at last year this affected this

92
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,280
part of the world with the colonial

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,379
pipeline breach this was an interesting

94
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,840
case of physical and Virtual Worlds

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,239
converging you know you had actual

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,000
pipeline delays and oil shortages for

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,980
about 10 days because of a ransomware

98
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,040
attack and anyone has a credit score

99
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,260
which is anyone here over 18 which I

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,760
think is everyone you've been affected

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,239
by Equifax you know in 2017.

102
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,099
um and this you know people were trying

103
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,200
to tell Equifax hey for months there's

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,140
this problem we have Apache struts we

105
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,000
need to fix this issue nobody listened

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,319
or they didn't care they didn't know the

107
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,720
extent of the problem so deception

108
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,760
technology is a new approach that gives

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,139
you higher Fidelity and lower volume

110
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,839
this is why we need it

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,540
anyone here remembers Jimmy McMillan he

112
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,639
was a 2012 presidential candidate and

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,100
Republican ticket this whole platform

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,500
was about the price of rent being too

115
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,979
damn high and he was right but cyber

116
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,780
crime is even higher if you look at some

117
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,120
of the statistics it was estimated to

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
cost six trillion dollars to the global

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
economy in 2021

120
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,919
um every 39 seconds roughly there's

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,900
another breach

122
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,780
uh last year there was 847 000 cyber

123
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,460
complaints to the FBI

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,440
and up until now there was probably no

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,419
hope of a solution but let's talk about

126
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,820
why there may be now

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,639
and so I kind of talked about earlier

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
how long it takes to detect a breach 212

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,720
days is the IBM report 2021 an estimate

130
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,100
of how long it takes to even not even

131
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,220
breach that amount of time allows for a

132
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,440
significant amount of

133
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,540
accounts to be dumped if you look at

134
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,919
some of the biggest breaches in history

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,039
you have Cam4 what's interesting here is

136
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
you've got almost 11 billion accounts

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,639
and there's only seven and a half

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,919
billion people on planet Earth which

139
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,300
means that there are some people doing

140
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
naughty things didn't want people to

141
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,960
know that they were doing them so that's

142
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
a lot of accounts you look at Yahoo

143
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,300
every vertical within Yahoo has been

144
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,479
breached you got fantasy sports Finance

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,820
they had multiple breaches three billion

146
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,460
accounts you know you've been your

147
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,080
information's been out there if you ever

148
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,960
had a Yahoo account and then the one

149
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,000
that was pretty devastating it had some

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,460
really really real world ramifications a

151
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,400
d h a r that was India's attempt to

152
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
digitize their entire economy and link

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,940
your driver's license to your 401k to

154
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,300
your bank account so on except the

155
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,520
identity system wasn't super secure and

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,860
the government advertised hey if anyone

157
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,800
can reach my account well you give this

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
an invitation to hackers in less than a

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,940
day later everyone in India's account

160
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,000
has been compromised so it's

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,180
entirely too long

162
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,759
so I want to talk now about things

163
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
Canary and

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,319
you know the canary and the code line or

165
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,819
the coal mine however you want to say it

166
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,400
so things Canary I'm not actually an

167
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,240
employee of theirs I am a partner and I

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,039
believe so sincerely in what they're

169
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,139
doing that I'm willing to go on these

170
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,139
talks and and discuss their their stuff

171
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,319
because personally I have seen what

172
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,600
would have been four headline worthy

173
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,419
breaches avoided I've seen really

174
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,120
sophisticated pen tests and arrogant red

175
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,979
teamers no offense to the Del

176
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,560
secureworks people but I uh they've come

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,600
in thinking they were going to pone the

178
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,860
environment in eight minutes they

179
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,360
tripped over a token and then they

180
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,340
tripped over another token and you know

181
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,380
there was a really funny story I tell a

182
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,840
couple years ago where there was a

183
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,360
report that was generated by X-Force on

184
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,860
a red team assessment that went on for

185
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,560
three weeks and they you know came in

186
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
they dropped the report it was a 711

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
page report of all their findings but

188
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,560
while they were doing this I was also

189
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,419
compiling a report of everything that

190
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,940
they were tripping over my report was 94

191
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,880
pages and so when they came in acting

192
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,039
all arrogant throwing their stack of

193
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,560
papers down I met them with a larger

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
stack and they felt pretty stupid so

195
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,500
let's so let's talk about

196
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,440
how you can use these canaries right so

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,539
the idea of a canary could come in the

198
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,039
form of a bird

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,860
which is a Honeypot traditionally and a

200
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,400
token which is a honey token birds are

201
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,380
anything that looks like a legitimate

202
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,139
device so you can have a scada system a

203
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,660
dumb coffee machine a smart frit

204
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,400
whatever you want to call it it's gonna

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,380
look just like the real thing and the

206
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,240
idea is to entice an adversary an

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,699
adversary is going to try to interrogate

208
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,319
this system and when they do it's going

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,819
to fire alerts and it's going to

210
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,139
immediately tell you that something is

211
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,539
amiss that's the idea with these Canary

212
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,759
birds and then you've got Canary tokens

213
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,139
like I mentioned at the beginning

214
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,660
there's a free site canarytokens.org

215
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,580
where you can go and generate an

216
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,259
unlimited number of tokens and these

217
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,839
tokens Can Be QR codes like so many

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,299
scans a QR code and it automatically

219
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,219
fires an alert and it might Rick roll

220
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,958
them or you can get creative there it

221
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,539
might be AWS Keys you know you can drop

222
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,880
them on every laptop in your company if

223
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,500
somebody tries to access the keys it's

224
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,480
going to fire an alert and over time

225
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,220
when you start to layer these tokens

226
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,380
together you end up creating such a

227
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,080
detailed forensic trail that you have a

228
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,580
pretty good idea of who this person may

229
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,040
be uh and if you don't you can hire a

230
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
third-party company or start to use an

231
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,580
incident response tool Alima Charlie for

232
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,680
example and you can start to really dig

233
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,779
in and figure out with a high degree of

234
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,880
certainty who this person may be yeah

235
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,860
you can be anonymize the pull of people

236
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,140
pretty easily based off more and more

237
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,760
information you gather from these tokens

238
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,380
and I'm going to walk you through that

239
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,839
but first let me show you what a bird

240
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,260
looks like

241
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,740
we'll talk about the bird is the word so

242
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,899
let's talk about the window to the walls

243
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,740
no so Windows is used in pretty much any

244
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,500
Enterprise that's 10 years or older they

245
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,899
use active directory active directory

246
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,760
there's a way to essentially manage

247
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,880
users passwords devices printers and

248
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,360
it's also like open to being compromised

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,820
there's like 20 years of research on how

250
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,800
to attack active directory you've got

251
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,620
Kerber roasting you've got

252
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,980
um you know DC sync DC shadow

253
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,560
um golden ticket you go you name it so

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,600
this is a very attractive Target for an

255
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,820
adversary so what we can do is we can

256
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,519
spin up a domain controller that looks

257
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,380
just like a domain controller and you'll

258
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,200
see on the next slide and it it's so

259
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,580
legitimate actually that I'm gonna have

260
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,899
to show you another slide on another

261
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,580
device because

262
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,680
the recommendation is if you already

263
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
have Windows you may not want to deploy

264
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,279
this because it's so realistic it may

265
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,720
start interacting with your environment

266
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,899
causing issues so let me just show you

267
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,480
so for those that are familiar with nmap

268
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,000
it's a classic service important

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,040
numeration tool might be a little hard

270
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,899
to see from here but I basically just

271
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,959
ran a detailed nmap scan against the IP

272
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,660
of a bird targeting ports common and

273
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,820
active directory and if you look at all

274
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,560
the service information

275
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,220
starting at like 22 SSH and notice that

276
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,480
it's Microsoft Windows you could

277
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,579
hard-pressed to tell the difference 80

278
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,860
is I internet Information Services if

279
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,260
you were to visit this IPM Port 80 you'd

280
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,720
actually hit an IES flash screen and you

281
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,660
wouldn't know but I would know and you

282
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,660
also have Kerberos Port 88. it's even so

283
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,000
customizable down to the domain if you

284
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,880
see under Kerberos at the bottom it says

285
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,320
tc-80.thinks.com you can customize this

286
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,899
to be 80. besidescharleston.org or

287
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,940
whatever you want to make it look as

288
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,399
believable as possible even and this is

289
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
a bad idea but even SQL Server don't put

290
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,880
it on with a domain controller but

291
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,680
people do it all the time but it even

292
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,779
tells you like the version the patch

293
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,180
number all of that stuff and so the

294
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,459
moment they a bad guy starts to fire off

295
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,660
in that

296
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,279
this thing lights up like a Christmas

297
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,380
tree so what you can see on the left

298
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,660
here these are just a bunch of alerts

299
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,339
and so not only are you getting port

300
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,600
scan alerts

301
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,360
you also get alerts um if people try to

302
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,399
run an FTP command so maybe somebody's

303
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,380
going to try to access FTP on this hose

304
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,040
it says here FTP login attempt or HTTP

305
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,019
like I mentioned IIs if you visit that

306
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,000
site and enter credentials you'll see on

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,220
the right side here well it's hard to

308
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,860
read but it says password and username

309
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,440
not supplied if they were to type in

310
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,360
spaghetti and pizza or whatever these

311
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,459
both will pop up it captures every bit

312
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,339
of information and in the process you

313
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,200
get an IP this is where you're going to

314
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,240
start your investigation and then you

315
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,000
also get and the number of alerting

316
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
endpoints I'm using slacker as an

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,240
example you can send it SMS email age or

318
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,579
Duty jira really anything you can use

319
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,500
this orchestration platform called times

320
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,839
that's free and awesome to basically

321
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,760
create any scenario you want and

322
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,399
orchestrate and so now we have an IP

323
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,779
this is a great place to start with our

324
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,339
forensic Trail

325
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,560
but I also wanted to show you a

326
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
non-windows scenario

327
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,459
so a lot of people love g-ball pen

328
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,079
testers and red team just love Joomla

329
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,000
because June was vulnerable and when

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
it's on the Internet it's a Target it's

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,139
a Content management system and it's

332
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,540
kind of a bird running Juma looks pretty

333
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,519
legit I mean if you didn't customize it

334
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,560
and use a nice little flowery background

335
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,579
but you know you customize it and again

336
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,800
like we get the IP address this is

337
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
helpful we also get

338
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,940
um the user agent so we already know

339
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,620
this is our de-anonymization pool

340
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,820
they're on a map and they're running it

341
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,440
looks like Mozilla and so I know the IP

342
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,540
I'm in Richmond there's only so many

343
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,760
Macs and there's only so many windows or

344
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,940
um uh Mozilla browsers this data is

345
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,620
actually collected all the time if you

346
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,380
use uh steam the service for gaming

347
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,300
there's the valve Hardware Hardware

348
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,399
index where they ask you to upload your

349
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,779
information all your Hardware

350
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,639
information is up there so you can start

351
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,300
to see where this might be helpful

352
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,279
I also wanted to mention in the world of

353
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,980
Honey pots traditionally so the way

354
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,260
thanks looks at Honey pots they call

355
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,639
them production honey pots these are

356
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,459
more focused on you as a person and

357
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,839
what's interesting but if you look at

358
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,519
the research around honeypots for 20

359
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,800
years all they used to do is sit on the

360
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,060
internet and listen for intelligence

361
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,339
they used to say well this is a bad

362
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,860
thing there's an SSH worm there's this

363
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,500
and that well you can actually use your

364
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,540
honey pots in a similar way as an

365
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,459
outside bird and you can run it through

366
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,620
this tool called gray noise they're in

367
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,620
DC super neat tool what they do is they

368
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,540
look at the thread Intel they look at

369
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,620
like cloudflare and AWS and

370
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,820
Showdown and they say we know these IPS

371
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,560
are not important because they're

372
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,060
deterministically scanning internet

373
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,680
here's everything that you need to care

374
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,260
about and they give you what's left so

375
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,720
as an example I threw like about 5000

376
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,680
IPS and spit out like 800 the one the

377
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,480
ones that were at fault were China no

378
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,459
good surprise there in Russia and you

379
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,160
can see they have an API that's free a

380
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,740
website super cool company highly

381
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,139
recommend it free service

382
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,839
also there's another company here it

383
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
used to be called Rumble not run zero HD

384
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
Moore to uh Creator Metasploit

385
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,699
um Chris Wallace two awesome dudes they

386
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,199
got together and they tried to figure

387
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,420
out how to solve asset inventory because

388
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,980
they said hey this is a really hard

389
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,079
problem most of the time people are

390
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,519
trying to defend things and they don't

391
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,540
even know what things they need to

392
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,779
defend and so run zero is unique and it

393
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,540
has a native integration with Canary and

394
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,399
what's cool about this is you can use

395
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,339
alerts from Canary to send IPS

396
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,579
automatically to assets so why this

397
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,579
would be helpful is maybe you have a log

398
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,420
4J alert from an endpoint internally and

399
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,160
you kind of want to know about this in

400
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,660
your ass in inventory like if one of

401
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,820
your machines is communicating to a tour

402
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,800
endpoint you're like what's going on

403
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,540
it's probably compromise this is a great

404
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,060
way to have contacts and enrichment of

405
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,240
your alerts and you know Canary and run

406
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
zero go together like Shack and broken

407
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,959
backboards and if you don't believe me

408
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,399
I mean

409
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,860
this is just a couple of examples right

410
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,180
you know there's probably another 12

411
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,639
that he's broken in half so yeah just a

412
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
match made in heaven all right so I

413
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,060
talked about birds

414
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
let's talk about tokens tokens all the

415
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
way down

416
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm going to talk about Recon

417
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,940
and there's a few examples of Recon rest

418
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,880
in peace Chris Farley so the first type

419
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,000
of token you can use is called a deceive

420
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
nosy stranger token DNS token and so the

421
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,019
domain name system is a way to map

422
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,839
names like besidescharleston.org to an

423
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,760
IP so you don't have to remember it most

424
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,959
people don't like remembering numbers

425
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,959
unless you mean and you know you don't

426
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,540
have to do that so what we can do and

427
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,940
kind of reversing this Paradigm we can

428
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,459
use a DNS token on a dark Network

429
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,759
segment what's a dark segment it's you

430
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,959
guessed that it's a place where nothing

431
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,300
exists or nothing should exist and what

432
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,399
we can do is we can use the DNS token

433
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,459
and say this name maps to this IP in the

434
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,740
dark segment if there's a pen tester an

435
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,899
adversary or a bad person that tries to

436
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,360
resolve it and reverse it fires an alert

437
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,339
boom Snoop Dogg's in the building and

438
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,199
you can see down here

439
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,120
um well you'll notice that there's a

440
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,339
there's a name here dot canarytokens.com

441
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,919
it's worth mentioning that when you pay

442
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,419
for their host of service you get to

443
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,040
customize your domain so it's not as

444
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,720
evident like hey I use deception

445
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,040
technology you know you don't want

446
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,679
people to know that you have this so you

447
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,480
can customize your vanity domain through

448
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,459
your actual company domain

449
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,339
um and yeah they have better so cheap

450
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,559
just look him up very exciting and so

451
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,439
what's interesting about the DNS token

452
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,500
it doesn't tell me my IP right it tells

453
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,440
me the IP of the resolver but even that

454
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,660
it knew that I was in Richmond so the

455
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,580
first token of value they use the

456
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,980
cloudflare

457
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,860
1112 DNS server and I knew I was in

458
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,240
Richmond that's already like the

459
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,340
anonymizing the pool of who this could

460
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,200
be so that's a good bit of information

461
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,539
to start off with

462
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,120
now probably my favorite enumeration

463
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,860
token though is called the web redirect

464
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,520
token what's great about this is you can

465
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,520
have like a c name uh like any kind of

466
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,720
endpoint that's attractive like SSO dot

467
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,419
besidescharleston.org portal Dot thinks

468
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,520
that I owe and when they visit it they

469
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
quickly get redirected to a canary token

470
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,380
site and it grabs all this information

471
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,780
in the user browser this is where you

472
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,580
get a wealth of information that's

473
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,620
useful for forensics so you start to see

474
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,080
here you got the user agent again that's

475
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,240
a Mac it even knows that it's a Mac M1

476
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,980
and there aren't that many Mac cabin

477
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,780
ones because of the supply chain issues

478
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,780
so I have a Mac M1 I'm in Richmond I'm

479
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,940
having to use Mozilla it even knows

480
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,440
JavaScript and the version and uh this

481
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,880
is just from hitting hitting an endpoint

482
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,640
tons of useful information and it's

483
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,400
worth noting that this information all

484
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,380
the while should be sent to a Sim this

485
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,200
isn't a replacement for your

486
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,900
um preventative controls or all of your

487
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,299
you know endpoint detection response all

488
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,419
that Telemetry this is merely a way to

489
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,679
know when you've been breached in real

490
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,299
time if you still want to do forensics

491
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,940
you still want to collect and pulley and

492
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,919
activate and so you shouldn't be sending

493
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,900
these alerts and you can easily send the

494
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,140
Json syslog directly from things just

495
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,600
hit up their support team

496
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,039
there's also another really great

497
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,559
enumeration ticket uh Earth's open

498
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,260
weather it is the Clone website token

499
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,140
and even though imitation maybe this is

500
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,360
serious form of flattery probably means

501
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,100
you're about to be fished and so what

502
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,620
you can do here you create a token gives

503
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,020
you five lines of JavaScript all you do

504
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,179
is you embed that JavaScript like

505
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,000
obfuscate it put in your HTML Pages if

506
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,799
somebody takes your site clones it and

507
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,140
then redeploys it so besides Charleston

508
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,539
maybe there's an extra s in there dot

509
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,640
org if you visit it it's going to fire

510
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620
an alert and it's going to tell you whoa

511
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,960
somebody just took my site and they're

512
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,520
maybe it's part of a larger threat

513
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
campaign and you can start to gather the

514
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,240
metadata and figure out all right is

515
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,039
this just some punk who's interested or

516
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,320
is it a developer that's cloning the

517
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,600
site locally to test you can add to it

518
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,059
on a loud list and ignore lists but you

519
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,320
start to learn a lot of stuff and what

520
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,360
you can do with this is get your legal

521
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,860
team to send a cease and desist letter

522
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,720
I've seen this be effective in taking

523
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,299
down doppelganger domains or you can

524
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,220
just scare them either way you'll let

525
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,559
them know that you're on to him

526
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,480
awesome so we talked about enumeration

527
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,179
tokens let's talk about

528
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,940
API tokens application programming

529
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,000
interface ask Bert Macklin he's on it

530
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,360
so my favorite token of all I think yeah

531
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,419
the Amazon web services token these are

532
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,820
so useful because if you're a pen tester

533
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,880
a bad guy you want these These are the

534
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,500
keys to the kingdom you get a set of

535
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,840
keys you'd be hard-pressed not to use

536
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,580
them you tell me any pen tested it's not

537
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,520
going to try these AWS keys well the

538
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,679
moment they do

539
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,480
it fires an alert it also creates a Geo

540
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,640
map which is really nice so

541
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,919
why this is helpful is you can again

542
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,960
start to build a forensic Trail is this

543
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,880
part of a larger campaign are they

544
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,100
accessing AWS keys in one particular

545
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,740
region is it distributed the mistake

546
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,559
that a lot of adversaries see see I do

547
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,940
and I've seen in the wild

548
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,520
they will take these keys off of Susie

549
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,080
Q's laptop and they'll use them on their

550
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,360
machine well when they do we grab a

551
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,240
bunch of metadata to grab the IP the

552
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,400
City Country we even know the command

553
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,100
that they run list buckets you know and

554
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,919
so maybe they're you know most of the

555
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,200
time they're going to run AWS STS get

556
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,820
caller identity figure out who you are

557
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,860
but you know you can learn a lot about a

558
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,320
person by what commands they run so you

559
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,240
know consider that and then here's the

560
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,580
memo because on my laptop here's the key

561
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,460
and you can also token these keys and

562
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,900
give them fake permissions which I'll

563
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,480
show you because this will give you more

564
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,159
bang for the bucket the other type of

565
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,740
token in AWS land a simple storage

566
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,559
service S3 is just raw bucket storage

567
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,659
you can put stuff over the years people

568
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,280
have accidentally put sensitive

569
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,740
information and Amazon didn't really opt

570
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,900
you into security until recently and

571
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,240
your buckets used to be accessible and

572
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,620
writable with anyone on the internet

573
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,260
that's a problem but we can use this uh

574
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,880
to our advantage knowing that pen test

575
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,280
is going to look for buckets so you can

576
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,799
token an entire bucket and you can have

577
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,080
a token to the set of keys so that if

578
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,760
somebody tries to access this bucket

579
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,659
looks great like Aetna pii great there's

580
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,280
probably something useful in there not

581
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,799
really but it tells you here the type of

582
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,039
request man like ahead request user

583
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,580
agent again this was run on Moto 3 SDK

584
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,280
and Linux or Mac rather it was um I

585
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,500
think it was pit

586
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,820
tells you all of this stuff again more

587
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,260
information for the trail even tells you

588
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,820
the user

589
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,720
um and couple that with the AWS API key

590
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,520
and you're starting to build a pretty

591
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,740
robust forensic Trail

592
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,260
okay there's a lot going on this slide

593
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,580
and so

594
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,159
I'll just tell you this so heavy metal

595
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,100
slack what you can do with slack is they

596
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,659
have slack tokens and the way that I

597
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,400
like to drop slack tokens is similar to

598
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,620
the way exhibit likes to drop fish tanks

599
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,179
inside of fish tanks inside of your car

600
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,340
if you ever watch Pimp My Ride if not

601
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,960
you should so what you can do is you can

602
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
drop a slack token inside of a slack

603
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
channel so when somebody uses slack you

604
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,039
know they get stunned and anyway there's

605
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,340
a lot going on here but meta layering of

606
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,559
tokens is the way to go because the more

607
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,559
that you layer the more likelihood

608
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,880
you're going to have them trip over

609
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,679
these tokens and then they're going to

610
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,780
continue to create a forensic Trail and

611
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,240
de-anonymize themselves so I love it

612
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,179
there's also in the API World a new

613
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,620
pretty new token that came out it's

614
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,940
kubernetes

615
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,240
K8 it's a nickname if you if you see why

616
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
it's K8 letters s get it okay it's

617
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,919
anyway so it's a platform for

618
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,200
orchestrating a large amount of

619
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,240
containerized applications and a

620
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,400
container is just a self-contained

621
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,740
application that's OS agnostic well

622
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,419
these are also pretty attractive similar

623
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,940
to AWS Keys drop these on every machine

624
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,280
and your Enterprise put a memo you don't

625
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840
want to put something like test because

626
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,580
that doesn't tell you anything you know

627
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,799
that that's one mistake that people have

628
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,900
all these tokens test token this that no

629
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,299
make a unique memo you can automate this

630
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,380
with like

631
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,360
um any kind of endpoint management

632
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,539
system on endpoints you can use SCCM or

633
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,960
jamf um in the infrastructure world uh

634
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,360
probably limit Charlie you could use

635
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,820
ansible shaft puppet you name it you can

636
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,500
automate kind of Distributing all this

637
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,480
stuff

638
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,980
and then there's another one that just

639
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,520
came out a few uh months ago that I

640
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,280
really like this is if anyone remembers

641
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,460
the uh I accidentally uh 93 megabytes of

642
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,220
R files that Meme is just so good but

643
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,159
anyway so you can you can tripwire an

644
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,340
executable and in window actually and in

645
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,900
Windows what it does is it creates a

646
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,780
registry entry so that anytime a command

647
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,600
is run like who am I or netstat or

648
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,220
something that is used for situation

649
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,299
awareness

650
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,840
similarly it fires an alert and so you

651
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,280
know you're going to know pretty quickly

652
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,760
if like someone in marketing or

653
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,440
human resource or people the people

654
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,820
department they shouldn't be running

655
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,799
Powershell right so if you want to wrap

656
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,600
Powershell on a token or maybe you want

657
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,520
to wrap

658
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,500
and netcat or any anything that you

659
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,960
would not expect to be running on the

660
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,360
particular machine

661
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,659
cool so those were API here's a couple

662
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,320
of tokens for your phones and you can

663
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,240
put these on right now and I recommend

664
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,799
you do starting with

665
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,320
wire guard so wire guard is a new VPN

666
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
protocol that's kind of supplanting

667
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,960
openvpn and there's a token for this and

668
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,059
what you can do and the idea here

669
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,640
is you want to be able to detect when an

670
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,320
adversary is on your device and it's

671
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,760
really hard to do that if you look at

672
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,679
the Pegasus filer from last year in the

673
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,320
NSO group nope nobody really knew

674
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,179
without doing detail forensics that this

675
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,620
was even happening and how would you

676
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,779
know if your iPhone got iPhone well the

677
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,539
idea here is if you put a wireguard VPN

678
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,760
token you can create an attractive name

679
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
like Enterprise VPN endpoint and if

680
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,320
somebody activates it and it won't be

681
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,360
you because you know it's bogus they're

682
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,220
gonna trip this alarm and they're going

683
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,200
to fire an alert again you get a slack

684
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,720
memo it's a pretty good indicator your

685
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,179
phone's phone and then from there again

686
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,400
you can do you can use imazing and do

687
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,640
some detail forensics or you know any

688
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,500
number of forensic tools and call your

689
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,179
incident Response Team

690
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,440
um yeah because so much flow through

691
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,120
your mobile device now I mean people

692
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,679
there's more Mobile Traffic than

693
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,140
computer traffic now so like if your

694
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,080
phone is your Target and your phone runs

695
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,640
a lot of the same software as your

696
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,159
computer so just protect it you can

697
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,539
create this token right now highly

698
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,240
recommend you do

699
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,059
also you can scan this QR code it's not

700
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:58,980
a trap but don't do it if you don't want

701
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,779
to but the idea with these QR codes is

702
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,340
you can do some really cool things

703
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,140
because people like scanning QR codes

704
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,720
really like legitimize them they've been

705
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,600
around forever but you know toast Tab

706
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,039
and all these companies they're like wow

707
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,020
QR code quick response let's put some

708
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,299
data in here well what I like to do is

709
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,640
drop these QR codes in mailboxes that

710
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,039
are unread and you say like OCTA

711
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,080
enrollment code Duo device code

712
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,720
something something people are going to

713
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,340
trip on and I've seen it happen a dozen

714
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,559
times and you're like wait or you put

715
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,480
the wi-fi password around the office but

716
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,919
maybe you don't have a Wi-Fi password

717
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,140
maybe you do things the right way and

718
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,820
you push it out with jamf or you do it

719
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,900
securely

720
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,940
well they're gonna scan it and be like

721
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,640
cool nope

722
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,260
all right if you stare at this too long

723
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,960
you will hallucinate but let's let's

724
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,120
talk about the last category of tokens

725
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,720
associated with mind games at this point

726
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,360
if an adversary has gotten this far you

727
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
are just playing psychological warfare

728
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,740
with them and if they don't know that

729
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,200
you know they're about to know and this

730
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,580
is how you know

731
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,360
oh so I could start with uh databases

732
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,419
right database get it data basically I'm

733
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,120
pretty funny sometimes anyway so what

734
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,400
you can do is you can create a token

735
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,799
database that looks like legitimate data

736
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,659
I don't know what this is but it looks

737
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,480
pretty good so the moment they insert

738
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,220
the data just insert it right and then

739
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,500
open it fires an alert

740
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,020
um you know you can make it sound like

741
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,220
um you know FTA oh sorry FTX or ft

742
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,480
whatever like make it something

743
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,580
pertinent and topical to where they're

744
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,320
going to want to open it and then when

745
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,159
they do

746
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,500
okay there's a ton of info

747
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,380
um including yeah so you got your memo

748
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,419
you get your IP

749
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,299
um pretty great way to start you can

750
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,360
even insert a database like that has a

751
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,880
bunch of tokens in it why not or just

752
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,039
something in it that says I know

753
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,320
that you are in my network you should

754
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,799
leave you know for example

755
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,140
conspiracy Keanu I think he was on to

756
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,380
something he might have he's conspiracy

757
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,480
theories or conspiracy realities right

758
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,059
well what you can do here with Google

759
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,940
Docs or word docs or PDF files as tokens

760
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,799
you can create a file that says

761
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,200
something like you know FTX Financial

762
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,140
Ledger or whatever and 2022 Compensation

763
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,179
Plan people are going to open it and the

764
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,799
moment they do you can drop a truth ball

765
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
model so you can put in something there

766
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,020
about operation Northwoods or harp or

767
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,080
some conspiracy theory reality whatever

768
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,059
you want and you might just blow their

769
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,620
minds so much that they change careers

770
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,600
and just decide to be a legitimate you

771
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,460
don't know right but this is the point

772
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,140
you've got to be thinking like a bad guy

773
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,179
and what would you do if you open this

774
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,740
and all of a sudden you learn something

775
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,659
I don't know but I think it could be

776
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,820
effective

777
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,380
and then lastly kind of on that same

778
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,320
line you can spread some

779
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,539
bullshits and you can use financial

780
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,440
documents as spreadsheets or Google Docs

781
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,000
and I don't know if there's any DB

782
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,399
Cooper fans here if there are let's talk

783
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,340
but this is such a fun mystery that's

784
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,260
now closed by the FBI but it is

785
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,659
intriguing still and you can dump your

786
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,820
whole spreadsheet full of info of what

787
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,919
we think we know about DB Cooper and

788
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,440
that he hopped on a an airline on

789
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,899
November 24th 1971 it's the only person

790
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,659
who successfully skyjacked an airplane

791
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,820
and he might be dead but he might not

792
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,980
but the rewards 100 million dollars so

793
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,200
maybe they changed careers right maybe

794
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,020
they're done being petty scumbags that

795
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,360
send phishing emails perhaps

796
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,720
now let's talk about the final kind of

797
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,940
you know a wall up here how do we pull

798
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,679
this all together and make it something

799
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,299
useful that you can then package up

800
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,419
nicely to your friend 16. well let's

801
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:55,260
talk about deception Inception to leave

802
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,140
the better breach detection mouthful so

803
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,000
here's the scenario and there's a

804
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
zillion this is what's fun creativity is

805
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,919
your only limit you've got an adversary

806
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,799
who pops your server maybe it's like a

807
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,360
legitimate bird or maybe it's just

808
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,760
something with executables that are

809
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,460
token well once they're on there they

810
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,039
run netstat well that's token you send

811
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,600
it to your lean niece and you get it

812
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,419
because Liam Neeson

813
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:24,179
s-i-e-n are pretty funny so they run

814
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,500
next step

815
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,140
and then they probably run nmap because

816
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,220
they want to figure out situational

817
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,200
awareness and they want to say what else

818
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
do you have on your network oh they

819
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
happen to find a Windows files here and

820
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,620
that also happens to have a document on

821
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,080
it with AWS keys that gives you access

822
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,960
to an AWS bucket by the time it's all

823
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,460
said and done you might not know who

824
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,140
they are but you're going to figure it

825
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,460
out because you have a pretty detailed

826
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,380
forensics Trail and that's just one

827
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,720
example I mean you can literally token

828
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,299
and layer and the more the better you

829
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,020
can

830
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,700
there's no limits of tokens you can

831
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,500
create either for free or on the hosted

832
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,720
console

833
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,340
it's a lot of fun and so this is a new

834
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,080
paradigm shift like I said I believe in

835
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,760
it wholeheartedly by what I've seen I

836
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,919
hope that this has been useful and I

837
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,539
wanted to open it up for questions thank

838
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,399
you so much

839
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,399
foreign

840
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,659
it's a good question what's the

841
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:28,980
difference between a Honeypot and a wire

842
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,260
attack so a wiretap is essentially

843
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,179
sitting in line between a Communications

844
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,640
channel so like if the FBI needs to

845
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,279
figure out where some deals happening

846
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,380
they'll probably contact ATT and they'll

847
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,880
sit upstream and they'll listen and

848
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,460
they'll make a copy of it a honey pot is

849
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,399
like here's a here's a trap go this way

850
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,559
you know like here's a sticky honey putt

851
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,960
like Winnie the Pooh yeah exactly

852
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,520
there's lots of money here real money

853
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,380
just kidding you know and then so you

854
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,539
kind of you entice them to make them

855
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,899
this mistake and almost a wiretaps like

856
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,159
they've made a mistake and now you're

857
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,720
trying to prove it I don't know that's a

858
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,090
good question though yeah

859
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,379
[Music]

860
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,019
how do they get over it

861
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,880
it's a good question being very careful

862
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,320
right and that's actually a good

863
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,940
Counterpoint some of the elite red

864
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,159
teamers like what have you run into

865
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,720
environments like this do you even know

866
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,059
see that's the fun part is like when

867
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,620
you've seen the offensive security side

868
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,600
of things you can start to think okay

869
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,179
how do I trip up an adversary but if I'm

870
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,620
an adversary you know it's a cat and

871
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,600
mouse game and the old saying is you

872
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,760
know Defenders thinking

873
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,120
um graphs or sorry Defenders thinking

874
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,940
lists attackers thinking graphs until

875
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,399
that changes it'll never be like

876
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,940
attackers win right and so attackers are

877
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,159
going to find a way right they're gonna

878
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,620
um they're gonna get more creative there

879
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,360
are people that deploy this haphazardly

880
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,460
not stealthily and so they make it

881
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,140
pretty obvious that they have honey pots

882
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,120
or like I'm here and I'm not telling you

883
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,799
who I represent because I don't want to

884
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,720
paint a Target on my back and say I have

885
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,000
an ADT sign break into my house right

886
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
because it means I have valuable things

887
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,560
here so it is discretion but also you

888
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,119
need a discretion with your teams

889
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,399
internally right so like for example if

890
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,020
you want to push a code change to drop

891
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,659
AWS keys in your bit bucket or GitHub

892
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,000
repository you have to know let a few

893
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,739
people know but not too many because if

894
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,500
everybody knows then The Jig Is up so

895
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,060
there isn't really a good answer it's a

896
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,399
good question though I would open it up

897
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,219
to any pen testers here for their take

898
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,659
yes

899
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,919
so um

900
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,139
so thanks Canary their honey pot is

901
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,540
fully customizable down to the banners

902
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,639
to the ports so like if you know and I

903
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,940
they even have uh support now I want to

904
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,880
say for like a um a smart fridge or

905
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,740
something but they also have scada

906
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,960
systems and like they have templates for

907
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,820
like this is what a device looks like

908
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,700
but if you have an idea of like this um

909
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,280
let's say like an Amazon Alexa listens

910
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,980
on what 617 I don't forget the port but

911
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,780
you can actually customize the banners

912
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,520
the headers make it look just like it

913
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,500
and then they're super cool so if you

914
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,480
submit to them this template they'll

915
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,400
they'll add it to their to their catalog

916
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,320
like they're the coolest people ever I

917
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,820
can't say enough good things obviously

918
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,619
they do they make these birds and their

919
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,000
whole pitches in four minutes or less

920
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,980
you can be online it's true you know

921
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,040
plug it in and

922
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,359
yep and then you can templatize it

923
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,880
automate it with the API like I've I

924
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,380
love seeing how many birds I can

925
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,119
configure in one Fell Swoop you know you

926
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,740
can do hundreds literally once you get

927
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,800
this automated super cool

928
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,020
yeah

929
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,700
what's that

930
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,920
oh yeah Justin Varner and I'll share

931
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,780
this slide deck out but yeah let's I'll

932
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,140
give it to you I I need business cards I

933
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,700
don't know why not

934
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,040
please share them yeah oh yeah

935
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,839
absolutely

936
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,320
I have more so

937
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,060
stuff but like on frame like with

938
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,160
containers or something or people use

939
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,859
the clouds yeah it's a good question so

940
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,900
they have open Canary which is super

941
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,400
cool they actually just baked that into

942
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,500
the latest version of security onion um

943
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,359
so if you use security onion with it's

944
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,520
now they have open Canary I've used both

945
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm lazy so I like their Hostess

946
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
solution but also when when you pay for

947
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,700
the hosted solution you get the custom

948
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,800
vanity domain like I don't know if you

949
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,000
have a team of people that can manage

950
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,280
infrastructure great but most companies

951
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,859
with small teams need a little help and

952
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:44,040
they have excellent up time you know and

953
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,599
I don't know I I feel like it's a

954
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,859
pleasure dealing with their support team

955
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,720
because every time they you do they just

956
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,220
send you free swag I don't know what it

957
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,780
is about them they're just great people

958
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,119
so I mean but you can totally like like

959
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,700
anything in the right security model

960
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,099
freemium is best when you give enough to

961
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,540
people where they can do it themselves

962
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,540
if you have the time but you pay for it

963
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,859
if you don't and you want the support

964
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,780
you know that's the right model that's

965
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,900
how great noise and run zero and uh

966
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,440
you know all the good times lima charlie

967
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,940
all those companies that have that right

968
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,079
approach

969
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,180
you know they're the ones that I really

970
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,598
believe in

971
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,720
anyone else

972
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,099
uh the Google alone I was curious about

973
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,400
Davis yeah

974
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,400
so you create like a copy of a Google

975
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,800
doc that has like a Google app script

976
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,300
that runs transparently in the

977
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,099
background so the moment you share you

978
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,900
share it to everyone so somebody opens

979
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,280
it boom you know yeah it's great it's

980
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
one of the best and they're always like

981
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,920
there are people that are going to be

982
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,720
sleeping around like legitimately yeah

983
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,000
but then you kind of see a trend like I

984
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,040
this is great for Insider threat like I

985
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,020
have seen this find several people that

986
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,640
were up to no good and like it was part

987
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,000
of a larger narrative you know so okay

988
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,400
testers that have completely invaded

989
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,560
this and they have some boasting rights

990
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,720
because you're saying it's tripping I'm

991
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,300
I'm inviting them I have not because a

992
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,740
lot like I don't know what it is and

993
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,300
I've dealt with a lot of pen testers

994
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,020
companies praetorian X-Force stage you

995
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,240
name it they always trip over something

996
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,280
and then it's cascading but then again

997
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,800
it's like if you how can you not when

998
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,020
you litter it with just garbage right

999
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,700
it's like even if you're the most

1000
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,140
careful pen tester by the time you're

1001
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,160
done you're not going to do anything

1002
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,079
right and you normally you're in a Time

1003
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,240
limited engagement and speed is of the

1004
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,460
essence and so if they have to slow down

1005
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,380
for every little thing well you'll

1006
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,700
probably have enough time to figure this

1007
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,260
out and that's the whole point it's not

1008
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,700
necessarily even to detect them it's to

1009
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,380
slow them down so they move on to an

1010
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,800
easier Target yeah

1011
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,900
just imagine they're all mines though

1012
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,900
right

1013
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,359
thank you so much
