1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,560
uh can you hear me yes

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,000
all right

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,860
um anybody know what's the catchphrase

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,000
for the hitch hikers Guide to the Galaxy

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,699
the first two words

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,640
yeah don't panic so

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,320
so basically

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,220
um

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,859
those are the exact same words that were

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,260
floating in my head when I was asked to

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,960
do or build up an iot security program

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
or

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,579
um a company a Fortune 500 company

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,540
I was lost and um I didn't know how to

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,640
build it my background was from

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,200
application security

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,500
and um I know right now it's a quite a

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,620
cold day and long day but um let's take

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,620
it easy and unwind and uh go through an

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,739
easier to digest topic uh which is an

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,940
introduction to iot security and testing

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,039
so it's kind of cool that the

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,979
culminating topic right now is uh sort

24
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,680
of a mix between everything that was uh

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,619
talked about earlier today we have uh we

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,180
are going to talk about Hardware

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,180
Security application security

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,979
um threat Intel

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,140
um application development and even

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,259
incident response so um hello everyone

31
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,820
um good afternoon

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,619
um let me introduce you to a hitch

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,100
hackers Guide to the iot a security from

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,640
a perspective of fast moving consumer

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,240
goods company

36
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,159
so quick introduction my name is Jerome

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,100
de las Alas you can call me JD I'm from

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,439
Atlanta Georgia uh this is my first time

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,479
here in Charleston um it's a very very

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,979
good city

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,720
um and a very pretty

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,500
um

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,380
I'm currently doing product security

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,659
um for Kimberly Clark

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,380
um

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,600
for 12 years I was an application

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,079
security engineer I came from 45 on

48
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,840
demand before it was or

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,939
um previously it was from Hewlett

50
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,560
Packard

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,459
um so basically before cyber security

52
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,920
um I was doing or I was coding assembly

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
uh for a Japanese company uh doing a

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,800
laser measurement tools so essentially

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,980
um I was um doing development work

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,319
um but around seven years ago I was

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,940
hired by Kimberly Clark to build their

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,760
own application security program

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,099
um right now I'm focusing on iot

60
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,860
security we're doing a smart restroom

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,200
solution so basically

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,540
um for businesses to automate their

63
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,700
PayPal Tower dispensers and make it

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,300
easier to track maintenance of restrooms

65
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,340
um outside cyber security my interests

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,280
are astrophotography photographing the

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
Stars galaxies and uh looking at

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,180
millions of years ago from the past

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
as you might have noticed this

70
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,580
presentation is uh play in words

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,879
um for uh Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,800
Guide to the Galaxy

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,319
um which I thought suits um this

74
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,720
walkthrough best because from a cyber

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,519
security perspective

76
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,920
um I I felt like it was I was just

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,659
hitchhiking

78
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,420
um my um journey through iot security

79
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,599
because nobody knows how to like build

80
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,120
iot Security Programs especially from a

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,860
non-technology company like Kimberly

82
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Clark right so um there was no Surefire

83
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,560
way to go through iot iot security back

84
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,260
then a couple of years ago and the whole

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,599
iot security landscape is still a mess

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
until right now

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,620
um there is no standardization no

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,379
security controls uh unlike application

89
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,000
security which has OS etc etc right so

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
um basically

91
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,540
um we're doing our best effort

92
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,480
um to mimic what we are doing

93
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,239
from currently established uh Security

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,360
Programs like web network security etc

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,319
etc

96
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,440
so let's switch perspectives for a while

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,959
a majority of the talks today are from

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,000
um cyber Security Professionals uh

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,480
vendors that are that are providing

100
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,019
um Security Services to companies but

101
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,779
from my company from my perspective we

102
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,000
are on the receiving end

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,940
um it is our business that's that wants

104
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,820
uh security from the experts

105
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,139
um

106
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,540
these are the color-coded chapters that

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,660
we're gonna go through uh to um figure

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,960
our way out or figure our way through

109
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,859
um iot security

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
so our first tip uh figure out where we

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
are um at this point we are aiming to

112
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,880
figure out where we stand what's our

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,880
posture in the current iot landscape

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,520
um for

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
essentially all the um iot devices in

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,479
the world

117
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,880
um Kimberly Clark as you might know is

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
specializing on paper products like

119
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,120
Kleenex uh diapers like Huggies

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
um and it is estimated that it is

121
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
estimated that one-fourth of the world

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
is using sorry yeah one-fourth of the

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,300
world is using Kimberly Clark products

124
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,780
per day so it it covers quite a lot of

125
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,680
uh people but um yeah remember the

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
pandemic when everybody ran out of

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
tissue papers yeah that was us

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,280
so um why on Earth would we run out of

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,340
uh technology

130
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,740
would we want uh to dive in into a

131
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,440
technology we are a paper company right

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
um the short answer there is there is a

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,680
market for it

134
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,919
um businesses want to automate they they

135
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,139
want uh efficiency in their businesses

136
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,060
and that's why we're providing iot

137
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,880
solutions to uh easy

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,820
um for easier monitoring of their

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,060
um bathrooms or restrooms

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,759
and that that was the point where we

141
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,100
thought uh we needed to take take a step

142
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,940
back and um Define for ourselves uh what

143
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,160
the hell is iot and where would our

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,220
products be in our in the ecosystem uh

145
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,740
we we also had to evaluate our offerings

146
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,639
and um how to integrate Security in the

147
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,740
development of the product

148
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,960
um in the next couple of slides we'll go

149
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,680
through the what the why and the how

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
so basically these are just clippings of

151
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
uh issues and growing concerns for iot

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,979
security

153
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,740
um since 2018

154
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,979
um until recently um consumers are

155
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,560
slowly starting to be aware of iot

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,600
security and

157
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,720
um as we move forward I think it would

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,880
um start to get more visibility from

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,900
everyone

160
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,060
um something some I think worth noting

161
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,880
here is the uh Google uh smart speaker

162
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,819
Fiasco here when um they admitted uh

163
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,580
that they kept a recording of users

164
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
um without the Wake words okay Google so

165
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,120
it's kind of interesting for me

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,940
um these are just small samples of iot

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,100
and connected devices from the more

168
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,919
normalized ones like smart TVs smart

169
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,099
cars smartphones uh onto on until the

170
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,160
until the more absurd ones like uh smart

171
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,460
salt shakers uh smart sandals um smart

172
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,620
toothbrushes everything is smart right

173
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,699
now

174
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,280
um there is a quote here from uh the

175
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
Oxford dictionary

176
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
um which is uh it's a sample usage

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,259
sentence from Oxford uh which I found

178
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,599
quite interesting given that the

179
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,539
the first thing they thought about

180
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,900
um aside from the transformation for iot

181
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,440
is uh security

182
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
and then we have to evolve we had to

183
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,380
evolve away our way of thinking uh from

184
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,440
a normal software uh development life

185
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,680
cycle to what we now consider as system

186
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,440
development life cycle uh we had to look

187
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,599
into emerging Technologies and make new

188
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,800
efforts

189
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,560
um to do security considerations for

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,620
each I broke down this these pillars

191
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,440
into five distinct items uh that we can

192
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,960
separately test and ensure efforts on

193
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,180
security uh um controls and

194
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,879
configurations for each

195
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,419
um these are hardware and firmware

196
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,339
um and just a side note uh we have

197
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,260
collaborated with our earlier speaker

198
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,320
Jake here uh from andient

199
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,659
um and his team to get our Hardware

200
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,099
tested

201
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,720
um I believe they did the methodology

202
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,240
that they he described earlier or not

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
one of our products

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,980
yeah it's so cool so

205
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,080
um Communications and networks and

206
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,899
protocols like Bluetooth low energy

207
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,940
cellular mqtt

208
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,560
um and of course we already have

209
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,360
application security and mobile security

210
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,120
kind of in the back because uh we have

211
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,820
established our application Security

212
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,459
Programs way earlier before and then

213
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,560
there was a secure Cloud configuration

214
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,019
and hardening which is also a bit new

215
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,380
for us

216
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,660
and then we saw a new and different

217
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,820
risks and opportunities what that we

218
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,279
previously uh just kept at the back of

219
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,600
our minds

220
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,880
um we all we oh we always find this mean

221
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,740
uh funny because

222
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,260
um essentially when the hackers uh need

223
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,240
only to be right once

224
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,580
um to measure their success well from a

225
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,680
security perspective or from our

226
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,140
perspective anything less than 100 is

227
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,540
considered faulty

228
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,300
um this also means that considering that

229
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,740
nothing is standard

230
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,899
um there's no consensus way to protect

231
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,720
iot implemented implementations since

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
there are thousands if not millions of

233
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,899
permutations

234
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,880
um on how to build an iot solution

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
and then when the product was prototyped

236
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,380
we had to establish a method to the

237
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,560
madness um I call this a trial by fire

238
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,180
um we were already there there's no

239
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,519
going back uh we had to move forward and

240
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,980
so we did uh we will I will walk us

241
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,080
through each item and provide samples of

242
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,000
how we approached it

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,160
um most of you might find find this uh

244
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,360
simplistic

245
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,339
um I apologize for that but keeping

246
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,800
things simple is what helped us

247
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,080
understand how deep should we go in

248
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,120
terms of our security controls and our

249
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,420
design

250
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,160
our first

251
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,740
um tip is dual functional or normal

252
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Baseline test first I cannot stress this

253
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,680
enough if we have a device make it work

254
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200
first like you're a normal user

255
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
um and um not a an actual hacker

256
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,899
there's no point in uh doing security

257
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,880
testing If the product is not even

258
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
working right so for example if you are

259
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,980
testing a Smart Lock right here

260
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,620
um if see if it unlocks first uh

261
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,079
download the application and try to

262
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,820
unlock it normally

263
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
foreign

264
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,740
the next step is uh draw a simple

265
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,140
architecture diagram well with associate

266
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,740
functions and mapping of what it does uh

267
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,260
rtfm if you don't know how things work

268
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,600
usually these products have some details

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,240
and Technology on the technologies that

270
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
they use

271
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,339
um in their user users manuals

272
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,459
so for example here in the Smart Lock

273
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,320
um they advertise that they have a

274
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
mobile application and you already have

275
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,760
the hardware device which is the Smart

276
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,420
Lock and um we assume that the the

277
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,519
application is communicating through a

278
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,560
cloud environment and that's why what we

279
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,440
wrote here in our architecture diagram

280
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,620
foreign

281
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,540
open up the devices

282
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,860
sorry it's kind of cold

283
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,640
um list out parts that are easily

284
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
identifiable

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,480
um refer to user manuals and development

286
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
manuals

287
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,899
um and consult specific technical

288
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,060
documents

289
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,399
um majority of these um search engines

290
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,640
are very very helpful when

291
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,920
um when discovering

292
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,120
um the the user usage and um

293
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,820
um yeah um functions of the components

294
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,320
for example when uh we open up a product

295
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,260
there's uh usually an engraved label in

296
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,720
the microchip or microposter do a quick

297
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Google search for that uh either through

298
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,139
their FCC ID or their specific data

299
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,040
sheets

300
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
um shown here is an ESP microcontroller

301
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,839
esp32

302
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,360
um it's a very very common chip for

303
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,880
Internet connected products uh and

304
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
interestingly I noticed a little badge

305
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,459
here

306
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,760
um also is using the same check family

307
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,500
um funny when you look at the badge here

308
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,860
there's a QR code uh that should contain

309
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,740
information on when the chip was created

310
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,860
or manufactured and it should also

311
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,320
contain the MAC address of the actual

312
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
chip and other Vital Information that

313
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,660
are in the chassis of the microprocessor

314
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,399
so once we get the data sheet there they

315
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,200
these should display the pins of

316
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,600
interests not not Pinterest but pins of

317
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,880
interest that would probably want we

318
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,339
want to test uh pins like uarts SPI

319
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,660
jtags

320
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,420
um that data sheet would also on to us

321
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,079
which pin to pull up or pull down if you

322
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,899
want a specific desired function

323
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,360
um data sheet should also tell us what

324
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,760
which pins are the VCC or the power pins

325
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,279
as well as the ground pins

326
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,800
um it should also show the unique

327
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,260
specifications of the microcontroller uh

328
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,899
such as the delays and the clocks the uh

329
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,380
the timers Etc uh since we only have a

330
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,660
limited number of pins uh in a

331
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,519
microcontroller sometimes the functions

332
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,380
are multiplexed

333
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,540
um into different pin outs uh depending

334
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,860
on the developer's configuration

335
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,920
once we establish a method to the

336
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,100
madness um we we can expounding it into

337
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,100
a to map an attack surface so um

338
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,320
remember this is the the

339
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,120
um architecture diagram that we wrote

340
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,720
earlier what we can do is um since we

341
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,360
have established these functions what we

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,860
can do is

343
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,440
um these are the orange ones we can

344
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,959
write out the specific effect surface

345
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,019
that are are possible for for the actual

346
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,500
functions for example we have uh ble

347
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,240
lock here which is the physical device

348
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,139
what we can attack is uh the firmware

349
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,199
um um yeah physical security issues like

350
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,600
essentially pulling or uh breaking the

351
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,240
device itself and then um for example

352
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,579
Bluetooth low energy you can snip and

353
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,959
replay the traffic like um for using um

354
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,220
um yeah Uber tooth etc etc

355
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,100
so um Verma Cloud uh security

356
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,040
perspective check if the it is also

357
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,660
susceptible to brute force or

358
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,579
misconfiguration

359
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,220
um exposed API keys and tokens should

360
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,240
also be considered here

361
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,980
and then we do our normal tests uh for

362
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,600
each of the components I mentioned a

363
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,620
while ago

364
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,160
um yeah a few slides ago uh the common

365
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,139
go to tools here from the different

366
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,240
fields of security

367
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,100
um of penetration testing would be a

368
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,560
great start so for example for hardware

369
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,139
and firmware we have Benoit uh

370
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,660
microcontroller debug tools and um uh

371
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,240
the applications for uh Communications

372
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,660
we'll have Wireshark TCP Dom Uber tooth

373
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,480
Gap tool etc for web and mobile

374
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,639
applications we have the ever reliable

375
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,100
burp suite and the Z attack prophecy

376
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,380
this is we Where we exercise our

377
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,860
creativity

378
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,139
for example I was testing a prototype uh

379
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,480
or a solution of home and I cannot for

380
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,000
some reason sniff the traffic

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,720
um

382
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,579
um that was generating I ended up

383
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,000
connecting my device to my um pineapple

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,480
for mac5 and then I executed a TCP dump

385
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
from the the hack five

386
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,500
um

387
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,079
GUI itself then that's the only time I

388
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,300
was able to uh do the TCP dump of the

389
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,500
traffic

390
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,660
um or the piece the pcap files of the

391
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,920
traffic

392
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,500
um the internet is also full of geniuses

393
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,300
that um that are already have the

394
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,680
necessary

395
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
um tools associated with with that

396
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,380
specific Hardware uh for example uh

397
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,459
esp32 here

398
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,120
um if you search for the ESP tool that

399
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,820
python they actually have a python

400
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,459
script uh that can dump the actual

401
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,699
firmware uh once you connect and or find

402
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,359
the actual pin outs in the device

403
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,480
um and this is where the actual title of

404
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,720
this topic is we we hitch hike or we

405
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,599
hitchhike from the Geniuses from the

406
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,939
internet and use their expertise and

407
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,459
Technology to

408
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,020
um for our own advantage

409
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,820
so some tips while working through a

410
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,299
test though uh first be patient sleep on

411
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,039
it usually the answer is already there

412
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,320
but you are you just have to look at it

413
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,020
from a different perspective uh start

414
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,840
with the least invasive tests do not go

415
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,120
gung-ho in dismantling uh the devices

416
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,640
from your first test cases

417
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
um this includes testing the default

418
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,860
firmware and software before any updates

419
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,600
are um

420
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,760
um made or done um

421
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,980
yeah do not break the device for now

422
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,220
my next set of uh tips include uh

423
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,900
considering power supply and static

424
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,140
electricity from my past experience as a

425
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,360
hardware developer Hardware is 10 times

426
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,780
more worse to troubleshoot than software

427
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,880
um simple static electricity can break

428
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,820
your device and uh in a matter of

429
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,760
seconds uh soldering and desoldering

430
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,260
while the device is turned on could

431
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,940
possibly overheat

432
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,539
um uh the sensitive microchips possibly

433
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,320
um takes uh step-by-step pictures of uh

434
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
or a video while you're dismantling the

435
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,179
process uh this brings back memories

436
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,280
when I was a kid and being scolded by my

437
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,580
mother for not being able to put back

438
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,960
um some home electronics that I

439
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,780
dismantled those were the days

440
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,059
um but also on this math when

441
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,340
dismantling a device uh be mindful of

442
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,620
component orientation

443
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,440
some specific electronic components like

444
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,260
polarized capacitors uh might not work

445
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,120
or might even destroy your whole device

446
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,559
when you put it backwards

447
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,179
and then we go into the details of

448
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,460
documentation

449
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,980
I know documentation is a bad word for

450
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,460
uh penetration testing but um yeah aside

451
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,740
from the normal contents of an uh a

452
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,080
normal penetration test we include some

453
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,539
new components such as device versions

454
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,240
firmware versions that we tested

455
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,280
um also include the tests that did not

456
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,799
yield actual uh significant security

457
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,679
issues so that next time when other pen

458
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,260
testers uh do it they they would know

459
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,559
which methodology that was um that was

460
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,080
performed from the previous test

461
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,179
so in summary those are the tips that

462
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,360
help us configure or help us figure

463
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,340
um where we stand in terms of capability

464
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,860
and uh from a consumer goods

465
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,260
manufacturing standpoint some tests we

466
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,780
did we did on our Pro own prototypes

467
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,780
some tests uh we had uh to test devices

468
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,820
from the outside like if we were using

469
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,860
an external component

470
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,980
um or external um solution then we had

471
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,620
to test it ourselves as well

472
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,140
now we go to the second tip which is um

473
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,240
never ignore strategy for the sake of

474
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,480
how fast the iot uh environment or

475
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,179
landscape is changing our current chief

476
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,919
information security officer always

477
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,200
tells us to skate where the puck is

478
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,179
going so basically

479
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,799
um we look into the current iot

480
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,200
landscape and predict what what would be

481
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,340
the next Trend and so we can um manage

482
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,080
um the the security attack surface

483
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,960
that's going to happen on that end

484
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,919
um

485
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,460
yeah

486
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,740
so we also um asked our business to um

487
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,620
let cyber security have a seat at the

488
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,919
table uh in terms of decision making

489
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,900
um and have um

490
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,900
have some inputs from our end because at

491
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,720
the at the end of the day whenever a a

492
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,240
product is reached it's the whole brand

493
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,860
or the whole company that's going to be

494
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,340
affected

495
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,200
so also when starting we had to reach

496
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,120
out to different individuals like our

497
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
corporate Saturday strategists our r d

498
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,220
business owners to learn what they

499
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,320
Envision their product would look like

500
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,480
and from there I worked backwards to

501
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,100
fill in the gaps like the necessary

502
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,140
supporting documents

503
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,159
um standards like Nest OAS iotsf uh

504
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,679
provided my Baseline requirements

505
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,320
um special courses like uh the apify one

506
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,620
from Aditya Gupta and Sans iot security

507
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,520
course

508
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,679
um helped me establish the the required

509
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,179
test cases

510
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,760
um these courses also have the perk of

511
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,460
having security test kits uh that we can

512
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,740
practice on hardware for um some of the

513
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,080
hardware that we don't necessarily

514
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,840
prototype but we um we are curious on

515
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,659
how it works as well

516
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,360
so shift left has been a buzzword for

517
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,400
application security for quite some time

518
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,159
now why not integrate it in the system

519
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,380
development lifecycle as well

520
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,299
um note that we're still in the same

521
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,880
theme here um think of it as we're like

522
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,679
on a spaceship and lost in the galaxy

523
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,140
and shifting left is course correcting

524
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,840
and maneuvering our shift towards the

525
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,700
left

526
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,980
devops right now has some integration

527
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,080
with uh security automation tools like

528
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,299
SAS Das and software composition

529
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,100
analysis

530
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,659
um some of these processes and

531
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,720
integration can also apply to Firmware

532
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,120
development on how firmware it is

533
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,260
designed

534
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,780
um Seas or software composition and

535
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,960
analyzers in particular have um can help

536
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,059
build out the software bill of materials

537
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,760
which would immensely help in tracking

538
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,539
uh threat cves and uh the the actual

539
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,480
component updates and Frameworks that we

540
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,520
have previously used

541
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,500
um you also need to establish a threat

542
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,140
analysis early so that we ensure that

543
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,940
the necessary controls over each attack

544
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,940
surface and attack scenario that we

545
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,980
identify

546
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,100
so here's an example of the uh threat

547
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,140
assessment snippet

548
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,760
um first we identified the type of

549
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,080
threat

550
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,520
um in this case uh software uh the the

551
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,020
leftmost part here and then we

552
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,539
established the uh attack vectors uh and

553
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,120
the impact and then we established the

554
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,679
current status of the threat whether

555
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,860
it's mitigated or not or whether um uh

556
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,799
it's still open and then uh the rest is

557
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,840
for the incident response and how can

558
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,600
they how can they tell if something goes

559
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,179
wrong with the product

560
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,980
um we can also use some industry

561
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,919
standardization and uh recommendations

562
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,440
like the micro framework here uh we all

563
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,659
we listed out the some of the

564
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:52,320
um

565
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,500
yeah code uh for the actual threat uh

566
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,120
that we found

567
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,720
um or simply if you want to have a more

568
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,240
um quantitative approach you can use the

569
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,679
CVSs scoring for it

570
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,919
on point to our space space theme uh let

571
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,919
us uh timer jump or uh time or space

572
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,059
warp

573
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,220
um this just means that we need to

574
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,380
understand where is the balance between

575
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,320
letting go of the security range if you

576
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,539
want r d and Innovation to flourish

577
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,900
versus when we need uh cyber security to

578
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,360
come in obviously we would want cyber

579
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,159
security to be present in the final

580
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,120
design

581
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
but we would want we do not want a

582
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,940
full-blown penetration test on a Sandbox

583
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,700
environment right so the key word here

584
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,220
is seamless uh make it so that cyber

585
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,100
security is not um considered a

586
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,799
roadblock but uh rather a selling point

587
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,520
for a product

588
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,900
so oh no we uh need to test our ship uh

589
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,960
quick press the red button but um oh is

590
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
that the orange button so basically the

591
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,179
red teams are in uh are critical in

592
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,179
testing our security posture uh but we

593
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,100
would want involvement with our

594
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,799
developers and that's where the

595
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,740
um orange comes in we want a mix in

596
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,400
yellow which is the developers and um

597
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,220
join it with the red team making it

598
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,020
orange so

599
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,360
um historically and usually developers

600
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,240
are um and Security Professionals

601
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,059
professionals are at odds when it comes

602
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,120
to product development usually they come

603
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,260
yeah

604
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,179
so from my standpoint we just need to

605
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,500
talk to them

606
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,539
um make the developers understand the

607
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,120
value of our security controls and uh

608
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,100
bring to the um what our security

609
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,320
controls bring to the overall posture of

610
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,659
the whole solution

611
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,640
um make them realize that it would take

612
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,460
a lot more to fix if the actual

613
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,919
vulnerabilities are found uh late within

614
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,260
the production environment

615
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,120
um it wouldn't also hurt to listen to

616
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,460
their sentiments number one tip that I

617
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,960
saw here is uh make the developers uh

618
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,880
Implement

619
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,059
um an update or a mechanism to roll out

620
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,860
patches

621
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,260
um over the air would be preferable

622
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,240
the last tip in the guide is uh be

623
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,039
friendly to the other non-security

624
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,480
beings uh

625
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,640
yeah these includes Marketing sales

626
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,400
legal and business partners

627
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
um the cyber security organization

628
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
cannot do everything alone

629
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,299
um turn the tables and sell the value of

630
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,860
security for them

631
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,960
um for example say to the marketing and

632
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,480
sales team that they can slap a third

633
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,120
party security

634
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,860
assessments or attestations in their

635
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,900
marketing material so that the when

636
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,700
they're selling their solution

637
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,740
um the the consumers are more

638
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,620
comfortable uh with the the product that

639
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,940
they are selling

640
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,740
um scare them nicely about the

641
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,860
regulations uh and compliance like gdpr

642
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,620
cpra etc etc

643
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,380
and um lastly reverse the culture

644
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,860
usually uh a big company ingests iot

645
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,779
solutions for their own corporate

646
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,400
environment right

647
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,039
um we ask our vendors for example

648
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,679
um if their Solutions fit our cases or

649
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,039
you some some of our use cases now uh we

650
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,980
have to have a shift in perspective uh

651
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,659
we are now selling a solution to other

652
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,480
companies uh the mindset should be if I

653
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,700
was buying my own solution

654
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,220
um what are the security features that I

655
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,320
would expect uh for everyone to be

656
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,360
comfortable with buying my solution

657
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,460
yeah

658
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,340
so yeah that was my last slide

659
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,940
um

660
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,640
I I have in here um some of the

661
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,980
resources that I used

662
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,779
um throughout my whole journey

663
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,340
and uh

664
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,360
yeah thank you

665
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,268
[Applause]
