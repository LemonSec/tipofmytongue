26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,540
combination of text messages okay uh of

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,159
course it's presented more in like a

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,659
PowerPoint now because hey we are

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,840
professionals after all uh but uh Andrew

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,420
and I were for many years now just just

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
complaining to each other how terrible

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,640
the pen test was and how terrible the

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
scope was or how we fired a consulting

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,100
firm or something like that what did

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,140
this company do what did this company do

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,360
well what did they do poorly the

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,460
original incarnation of this talk was

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,740
intended I don't need slides I just need

39
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,040
45 minutes and Podium I'm not complaint

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,540
just give me like a lazy boy and just

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,399
lay in there and just complain for a

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,899
while yeah so the talk is really about

43
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,119
the the ways we've found some consulting

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,860
firms do good work the ways we found

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,140
them not do great work and we'll talk

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,160
about the perspective of a

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,020
consulting firm and then the perspective

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,440
of a client but also perspective for a

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,400
candidate Okay so

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,599
why don't we start with that so client

51
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,280
wise you know it's going to be how do

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,160
you evaluate a consulting firm

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
it'll work on that how do you engage

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,000
with your security partners and get the

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,920
most value out of those engagements you

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,059
know what to keep an eye out for

57
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,620
if there are good security consulting

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,019
firms they're a not so good consumer

59
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,940
security consulting firms and there are

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,379
challenges with navigating those

61
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,239
relationships and we'll talk through a

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,519
little bit of that

63
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
and then we'll jump into working as the

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
consultant or the consulting firm how do

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,180
you engage with client how do you push

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,180
for transparency and really build that

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,700
relationship and then as Q mentioned at

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,319
the very end we've got uh we've got a

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,739
section on as a potential employee of a

70
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,840
consulting firm if you're looking for a

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,300
job well can you keep an eye out for to

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,540
try to avoid toxic workplaces or you

73
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,540
know places you don't want to wind up

74
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,980
because we did line up in a few places

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,260
that you shouldn't wind up real world

76
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,760
stories

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,280
um I think uh before we step into the

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,159
actual details a little disclaimer so a

79
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,780
lot of this stuff all this stuff it

80
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,640
comes from Real World experiences like

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
awesome will buy custom and I have had

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,920
either together or at firms we've worked

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,900
at other all points in time stories

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,519
we're not naming and shaming in this

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,900
session although we'd kind of love to

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,760
well we're shaming but we're not naming

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,879
shaming but not naming yeah but um it's

88
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,980
as all all real stuff that we experience

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,860
but it's all point in time so any uh any

90
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,319
firms that we encounter the problems

91
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,659
with May no longer be the situation that

92
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,099
they may have changed they may have

93
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,500
updated but it's it's still a good story

94
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,340
to tell so not not naming but uh but

95
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,959
talking about frustrations and

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,439
challenges and how to approach them

97
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,360
all right so

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,459
so for our first our first perspective

99
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,079
here as the clients

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,339
um one of the most important things that

101
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,079
you want to talk to

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,320
talk with your consulting firm about or

103
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,300
your goals

104
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,120
um

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,800
this is a critical item to communicate

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
especially in those initial discussions

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,919
where you're talking to sales you're

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,060
talking about engineering you're trying

109
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,860
to arrange for a pen test or some sort

110
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,979
of an audit you know any initial sales

111
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,560
discussions scoping discussions you want

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,820
to make sure that your goals are brought

113
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,800
to the table and that the company that

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,479
you're talking to has the ability to

115
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,699
help you achieve those goals there's

116
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,500
sometimes there's a there's a breakdown

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,639
there

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
um a lot of the times the sales

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
representatives will be happy to sell

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,220
you whatever you're asking for

121
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,560
but can they actually do it and do they

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
actually have the staff to to achieve

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,240
what you want to do you know are you

124
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,759
looking for a a comprehensive mobile pen

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,580
test for an application that needs three

126
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,979
weeks worth of work do they have the

127
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,199
skills on staff to do it do they have

128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,979
the uh do they have the availability

129
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,240
um and you want to have those

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,979
conversations be upfront with that stuff

131
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,259
make sure you get clear answers and make

132
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,380
sure that that's a two-way conversation

133
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,539
and that

134
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,639
that it winds up in the documentation

135
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,580
you know so

136
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,039
you know as you're talking through hey

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
these are my goals this is what I want

138
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,100
to achieve with this engagement we're

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,199
paying you x amount of money for for

140
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,300
services rendered you know make sure

141
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,039
that uh

142
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,320
make sure that those details of your

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,660
goals wind up in the contract the quote

144
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
or the statement will work somewhere in

145
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,960
writing so that they're actually

146
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,240
followed through on as I've seen I've

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,940
seen several situations where we have a

148
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,380
really good conversation with sales

149
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,840
sales engineering maybe we even got one

150
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,639
of the engine and one of the testers on

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,259
the phone and everything sounds perfect

152
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,000
they're going to be testing everything

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,940
to the spec that we are requesting in

154
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,300
this specific specific scenario and then

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,800
the paperwork comes through super

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,259
generic high level and then when the

157
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,940
actual testing comes down the pipe a

158
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,060
month later we get we get the wrong

159
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,479
tester and we get bad results and it's

160
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,819
it's not what we asked for now what we

161
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,520
expected so goals are really important

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,500
you want to be upfront about them and

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,580
want to make sure they're understood

164
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,580
received

165
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,020
discussed and then represented in the

166
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,419
paperwork and otherwise you might run

167
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,639
into some risk yeah and one thing that

168
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,139
also add to that

169
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,060
you define the goals you had the

170
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,940
conversation make sure it ends up on the

171
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,580
sow on the statement of work okay

172
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,759
because sales built that statement of

173
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,560
work sales had that conversation with

174
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,520
the client

175
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,759
me as a tester I am maybe two or three

176
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,199
layers broken diff further from sales so

177
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,699
might not even hear about what

178
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,800
conversations happened first thing I'm

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,479
going to do as a tester is look at the

180
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,419
sow the statement of work if it does not

181
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,880
talk about those goals at least at a

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,400
high level I don't know about them

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,120
so if it is not on the paper

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,580
you may not be as well covered as method

185
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,139
Tech just because you had a competition

186
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,419
with sales who knows if sales even took

187
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,759
notes

188
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,979
sales love to sell yeah yeah no we can

189
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,599
do that we can do that sure we got you

190
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,099
sure

191
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,979
two thousand dollars please

192
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,599
so as we're talking about the goals and

193
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,699
as we're talking about how make sure the

194
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,060
goals on the paper and whatnot

195
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,979
the flexibility to meet the goals is

196
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,900
also a very important piece in there

197
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,400
okay

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,139
um are they going to have the skill set

199
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,300
you want Andrew mentioned earlier

200
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,940
getting mobile app and test oh yeah we

201
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,520
got mobile app testers not a problem and

202
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,259
then on the side they go to the hiring

203
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,639
manager go hey can you hire a mobile app

204
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
and tester before the test starts all

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
right can you can you subcontract

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,539
another company to do the pen test for

207
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,860
us because hey we're going to make the

208
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,319
sale at the same time and there's this

209
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,419
nothing wrong

210
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,039
because then you're starting out as a

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,780
consulting firm you may not have enough

212
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,280
people to do all the tests that you're

213
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,599
going to end up selling you want to sell

214
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,539
more so your company gets bigger you get

215
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,360
more clients at the same time if you do

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,819
not have a mobile apps pen test skill

217
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,159
set in the company right now how do you

218
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
know the person you're hiring is

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
actually a good good mobile app and

220
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,799
tester well you already sold five pen

221
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,520
tests already on that topic okay so a

222
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,120
lot of times as a client you want to ask

223
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
those direct questions I've even had

224
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,320
some clients ask me to get my tester on

225
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,420
the line and they've interviewed them

226
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,120
nothing wrong with that you want to

227
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,980
spend fifty thousand dollars a hundred

228
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,959
thousand dollars on a pen test there's

229
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,120
nothing wrong with saying hey Consulting

230
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,940
form can I talk to your tester can I

231
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,920
evaluate their skill set you would do

232
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,200
that if you're hiring a person why not

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,740
do that with the company okay

234
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,839
will the report reflect reality we'll

235
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,540
talk about reports later but

236
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,300
when you are talking about those goals

237
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,700
it's important to have that conversation

238
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,339
with the consulting firm and say is the

239
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,220
report going to be related to my goals I

240
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,140
want a pen test because I want to comply

241
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,899
with HIPAA right but the report is

242
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,640
written for PCI

243
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,380
would that even make sense

244
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,500
so clarifying that beforehand and making

245
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
sure the report isn't going to be just

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
something like straight out of a

247
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,060
template and then now you're looking at

248
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,380
it going will my CFO like paying for

249
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,660
this will my data governance officer

250
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,019
like this will my HIPAA assessor look at

251
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,820
the report and go this was written for a

252
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,019
Healthcare Company

253
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,940
you know I'm Healthcare company but your

254
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,740
report talks all about credit card data

255
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,040
we don't have any credit card data so no

256
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,320
findings done no findings awesome you

257
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
guys are looking good the finding is you

258
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,180
did not have credit card data

259
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,540
um and this is where the buckets come in

260
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,100
and I'll let Andrew talk about the

261
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,260
bucket so so I want to talk about the

262
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,360
bucket story I'm a shoehorn in one other

263
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,940
thing real quick I want to mention it so

264
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,459
I've worked for I'm currently working in

265
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,140
an internal role as a director of cyber

266
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,220
security for a large Healthcare

267
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,860
organization but I've worked for three

268
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,320
different uh consulting firms over the

269
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,899
course of my career and on at least at

270
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,940
least 10 or 15 occasions especially with

271
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,580
the smaller firms

272
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,560
sales has sold something

273
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,420
and then the director calls me up and

274
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,100
says hey we sold this thing we don't

275
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,640
know how to do it figure it out

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,220
you know what do we need we got we got a

277
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,260
mobile test in a week what do you need

278
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,120
to accomplish that in an effective way

279
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,120
and

280
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,140
do we have what we need to conduct a

281
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,959
presentation

282
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,899
but uh yes um I'm gonna keep going but

283
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,959
it's I think it happens a lot more often

284
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,000
than you would expect and the the

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
trouble there is it's not always

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
transparent to the client the client

287
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
doesn't always know hey

288
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,300
company X said they'd be happy to give

289
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,779
us a mobile test you know in reality

290
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,760
they don't have the skills to do it and

291
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,320
they're going to try to find the skills

292
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,060
in three weeks leading up to the start

293
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,160
date and are those going to be good

294
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,120
skills are those going to be

295
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,140
comprehensive are they going to

296
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,399
Outsource it you know what does that

297
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,959
look like it gets Messier it's not

298
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,880
saying it's not going to guarantee a bad

299
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,120
result but the risk goes up

300
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,680
and you as the client don't have

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,279
visibility on that at all but um it

302
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
doesn't fit into our bucket this was a

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,279
real situation happened about a year ago

304
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,320
I wanted a internal Network pen test we

305
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,480
had some very specific goals and we

306
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,579
didn't want a general you know drop into

307
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,339
the network run run responder then try

308
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,380
to Pivot through A.D we had some

309
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,320
specific areas we wanted to Target with

310
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,779
specific set of engineering skills and I

311
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,300
even had a buddy of mine working at a

312
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,420
large a large pen test firm who I knew

313
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,459
had the skills to do it and he was

314
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,500
excited about the idea so I got on the

315
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,380
phone with him and one of his sales guys

316
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,760
and we started talking through it it was

317
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,380
now a long phone call talking about the

318
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,459
engineering

319
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,860
really exciting we are on the same page

320
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,959
my goals are lining up with what he

321
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,720
could do and everything was perfect

322
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,399
there from an engineering discussion

323
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,140
standpoint and what this should have

324
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,839
boiled down to was hey

325
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,779
let me pay for 80 hours worth of this

326
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,940
guy's time and we'll get the job done

327
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,279
and then we'll write whatever report but

328
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,680
we ran into a problem because because of

329
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,800
the size of the consultancy and the the

330
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
rigid way they do sales there were

331
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,600
certain types of services that they

332
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
offer certain types of buckets of

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,980
services that they offer and what I was

334
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,700
asking for didn't fit into any of those

335
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,959
and so we got through this fantastic

336
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,060
engineering discussion really excited to

337
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,940
hey we're gonna we're gonna give EDR a

338
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,380
run for its money we're going to do some

339
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,360
Invasion stuff we're gonna really hit

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,820
some areas hard on the network that

341
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,320
don't normally get touched it's going to

342
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
be really interesting and the sales guys

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,420
like

344
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,360
yeah it is

345
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,000
it's not on my list here

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,220
and I I hate to say it but that's that's

347
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,139
where that conversation died

348
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,700
we tried to have follow-up discussions

349
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,399
but the the quote the quoting process

350
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
the statement of work just fell apart

351
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
because of the bridges structured the

352
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,339
way they do sales it didn't fit into

353
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,040
what they normally sold even though on

354
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
the back end it would have just been

355
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,959
hours

356
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,940
hey give me give me 80 hours of this

357
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,139
guy's time you know it's a

358
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,540
225 250 an hour and let's go through and

359
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,160
write me a report at the end not that

360
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,000
complicated

361
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,860
um all right

362
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,420
responsiveness and project management

363
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,760
exciting Okay so

364
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
love-hate relationship with project

365
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,540
manager I love it I love it a lot but

366
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,560
it's it uh it stays up you love to hate

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,980
it I hate to love it yes yes okay is it

368
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,440
Friday and my PM's asking for updates or

369
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,639
is it Monday and I'm telling the team

370
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,079
what to do

371
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,760
um

372
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,620
uh communication and project management

373
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,660
so there's a recurring theme throughout

374
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,920
this whole throughout this whole

375
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,420
presentation about transparency and

376
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,880
communication between client and

377
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,420
consultant and you know that's a huge

378
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,100
huge deal if you want to talk to each

379
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,839
other have an understanding be open and

380
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,820
honest and transparent

381
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,800
um it's a in those initial stages when

382
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,019
working with an outside consulting firm

383
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,720
you want to make sure that they're that

384
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,339
they're timely they're respectful of

385
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,959
your time

386
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,980
um

387
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,260
do they have the resources available do

388
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,600
they have the time on their schedule to

389
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,279
do what you're asking or are they just

390
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,720
having to take your phone calls and

391
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,120
potentially line up the sale

392
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,660
um

393
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,880
are they well organized do they miss

394
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,360
meetings do they they uh you know do

395
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,100
they ignore emails do they not get back

396
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,199
to you for for weeks not not naming any

397
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,100
names

398
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,440
um

399
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,540
but um

400
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,399
is there a dedicated project manager on

401
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,380
their side it's something that that I've

402
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,360
run into

403
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,540
quite a lot and it it surprises me

404
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,180
um most most of consultants and firms

405
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,100
will have project man dedicated project

406
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,740
managers and they serve a critical role

407
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,600
they let the testers do the testing the

408
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,399
directors do other things and management

409
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,440
do other things and the project managers

410
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,000
coordinate the meetings can coordinate

411
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,920
the conversation and make sure things

412
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,160
happen on schedule and get done but if

413
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,899
you call it the consultancy firm and

414
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,279
everything sounds good but there's no

415
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,720
project manager

416
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,240
oh that's kind of a red flag and who's

417
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,860
who's keeping track who's making sure

418
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,420
that we're hitting those milestones and

419
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,660
and moving the project forward

420
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,899
um yeah and again are they respectful of

421
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,760
your time do they miss meetings do they

422
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,920
show up late uh

423
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,519
how do they communicate to you

424
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,940
um said if uh if a firm is disrespectful

425
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,760
or unorganized you know it could mean

426
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,680
that their their overall overwhelmed

427
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,360
with other work and they're not they're

428
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,459
not capable of taking on the project

429
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,380
that you're asking for or maybe they

430
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,000
don't have a project management team or

431
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,620
they have a bad project management team

432
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,019
and I think any of those you know

433
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,579
they're not necessarily deal breakers

434
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,500
but they're red flags it could increase

435
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,980
the risk you know every any time I I

436
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,139
sign a statement of work and I don't see

437
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,480
a project manager on the other side

438
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,399
I'm thinking to myself the report's

439
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,020
going to be late

440
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,510
[Laughter]

441
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,720
that also is this

442
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,519
time zones

443
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,779
when it comes to practice management you

444
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,339
gotta understand the start stop time

445
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,259
when did the test start when does it end

446
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,959
but time zone is very important it's

447
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,280
there's nothing wrong with hanging

448
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,619
overseas testers there's a lot of really

449
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,099
good talent in the US and outside the US

450
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,419
but if your tester is going to be

451
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,819
testing during the time all of you are

452
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,319
sleeping

453
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,199
and they have a question which is

454
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,179
sometimes the question is important

455
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,679
enough they cannot test without an

456
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,359
answer to it

457
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,000
you lost a whole day of testing really a

458
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,160
whole night of testing right if they ran

459
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,900
a scan for example or they were testing

460
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,760
something and something went down and

461
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,780
they were testing that specific

462
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,940
application has gone down now well

463
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,860
something pretty bad has happened I

464
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,360
would write that down as a finding in my

465
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
in my opinion but at the same time I

466
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,520
can't test anymore I gotta wait for your

467
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,620
team to wake up next morning and then

468
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,720
I'll test the night after that right so

469
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,700
discuss the time zones understand when

470
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,380
the testing is going to happen and make

471
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,880
sure resources are available on both

472
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,100
sides for that and it's it's critical

473
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,840
for a number of reasons but I wanted I

474
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,220
want that we're talking about we'll talk

475
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,840
about price transparency a little bit

476
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,440
further on but uh but on the back ends

477
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,559
99 of the time it boils down to

478
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,520
engineering hours and so if if your

479
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
tester is testing overnight and they run

480
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,880
into a problem you know they're gonna

481
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
test for an eight-hour block and at 2

482
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,919
A.M you know two hours into their

483
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
testing they uh they run into a problem

484
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
and that stops them dead in the water is

485
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
that and then your team can't respond to

486
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,440
their emails for another six hours is

487
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,960
that six hours lost yeah you know how

488
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
does how does that company handle it is

489
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,260
there an escalation chain to try to

490
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,179
resolve it is there other stuff that can

491
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,760
be done to to give them work to do to

492
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,620
keep working because

493
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,940
six hours could be a lot of money and if

494
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,799
you have multiple testers working on a

495
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,179
single project it just it just

496
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,100
multiplies yeah I mean average rate is

497
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,919
like 200 250 an hour right now in the

498
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,539
consulting firms that's a lot of money

499
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,179
there for sure so

500
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,460
very important piece of information if

501
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,840
there's one thing you walk away with

502
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,679
from here ask for a sample deliverable

503
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,960
ask for a sample report from the

504
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,299
consulting firm if you don't know what

505
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,400
the report is going to look like

506
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,320
you're not gonna like whatever you

507
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,059
receive after spending fifty thousand

508
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,520
dollars because it will either not be

509
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,080
something that fits your organizational

510
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,160
culture

511
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,480
or it is maybe great quality but they're

512
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,679
wrote it from a different perspective

513
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,559
okay I had a pen test where I was

514
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,500
testing 35 applications

515
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,240
when you're doing that it's very

516
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,880
important to know if you want all 35 in

517
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,299
one report or 35 separate reports okay

518
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,179
and at the same time understanding what

519
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,799
the client was looking for is important

520
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,380
so ask for a sample report if the

521
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,520
company doesn't have it because

522
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,620
something firm doesn't have it ask them

523
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,840
to go and redact the clients report and

524
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,059
send it to you right I I don't want to

525
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,320
spend fifty thousand dollars or

526
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,720
something that I have not seen

527
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
if they don't have a sample report that

528
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,160
might be another red flag

529
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,980
yeah so as we're talking about reporting

530
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,140
it's very important that when you look

531
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,260
at the report it speaks to you about

532
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,179
your environment

533
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,240
okay if you for example are heavily

534
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,700
Linux environment and the report is all

535
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,039
about Windows did they just not touch

536
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,720
the Linux environment did they not have

537
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,400
the skill set for it

538
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,919
if I am Healthcare company and there's

539
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,620
no discussion of ephi in there they

540
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,720
gained domain admin they gained access

541
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,520
to databases but they did not even

542
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,220
attempt to gain access to ephi do they

543
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,380
even know what business I'm in

544
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,679
I was working for a healthcare provider

545
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,520
and they wrote a critical finding we saw

546
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,880
your critical information for doctors

547
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,400
online okay what information is it oh we

548
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,559
saw the NPI numbers

549
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,360
do you know what MPS stands for no

550
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,760
national public

551
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,940
identity but it is it's it's public

552
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,700
information all right like you are

553
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,500
telling me that you found public

554
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,720
information is critical it's and nothing

555
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,600
wrong with with you thinking that right

556
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,460
you saw some random numbers in front of

557
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,799
a name that looks kind of serious but

558
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,660
Google see what that actually means

559
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,240
right uh use one finding the road was

560
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,440
sensitive Services exposed to the

561
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,280
internet

562
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,600
the sensitive Service Port 22 SSH all

563
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,659
right or sensitive it's very sensitive

564
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,360
yeah and they also a lot of findings

565
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,179
stating that we had uh really outdated

566
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,679
SSH server

567
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,020
now realizing it was a red hat with

568
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,780
backboarded patches and headers okay so

569
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,840
yeah they never tried to log in there

570
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,720
was no attempt of trying to go the next

571
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
step okay you give me a report and you

572
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,340
said you guessed a password that doesn't

573
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,080
mean anything to me what did you do with

574
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,020
that password did you even find that we

575
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,760
have MFA that you couldn't use that

576
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,460
password with did you even try to log in

577
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,280
to email did you even try to log into

578
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,679
maybe a payroll system what do you do

579
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,000
with that information is what's going to

580
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,220
be important show me impact in that

581
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,400
report don't just give me a finding the

582
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
self-signed certificate on the internal

583
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
network is not going to matter as much

584
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,799
as a self-science certificate on the

585
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,100
external network okay and I I still see

586
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,500
reports with oh you're using TLS 1.1

587
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,159
it's a high risk issue well show me like

588
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,799
show the impact don't just hand me a

589
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,900
fine name right so as you're looking at

590
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,640
the sample deliverable look for those

591
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,340
things and I'll end that way then I'll

592
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,659
hand it over to you

593
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,840
vulnerability scan is not a pen test

594
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,000
give me a nest Report with your logo on

595
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,220
it this is not a fantastic report

596
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,880
I could run NASA scan myself for 2500

597
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,020
pay 50 000 for a NASA scan okay so be

598
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,280
very mindful of these things because

599
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,320
there is a lot of that still happening

600
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,820
nowadays we've been making jokes about

601
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,880
nasus as a fantastic tool for many years

602
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,240
now and that stuff is still happening

603
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,559
if you find a consultancy firm that

604
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,120
sells you a full-fledged pen test for

605
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,320
two thousand dollars you're probably

606
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
getting an essay scan

607
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,620
[Laughter]

608
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,419
so this is kind of

609
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,159
hired a seat but we're moving on to the

610
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,320
consultant section and uh

611
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,000
you know I drink and I know things

612
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,280
because I'm a consultant I had I

613
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,720
actually have a news story about the

614
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
reporting piece oh I'm going back yeah

615
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,679
so so this is this is actually a nice

616
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,299
story is that about it it's new no no no

617
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,740
it's not you not you it's someone else

618
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,740
and it's not a catastrophic but it goes

619
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,020
to show it was a failure on my part we

620
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,659
had a uh we had a purple team operation

621
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,880
conducted with in conjunction with an

622
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,159
external third party and the the purple

623
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,280
tea mop itself was fantastic huge huge

624
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,280
value there the Tactical level you know

625
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,020
teams were working together well we got

626
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,640
a lot of great results out of it a lot

627
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,280
of great takeaways and you know it gave

628
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,520
us ideas and pushed us further but the

629
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,620
report that we got so it was a purple

630
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,020
team op the report that we got was very

631
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,659
much structured like a pen test report

632
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,120
and it kind of outlined technical risk

633
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,340
it highlighted the attacks that were

634
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,320
performed

635
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,059
um but the attacks that were performed

636
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,799
were conducted in a purple team context

637
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,299
so it's not necessarily that we're

638
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,940
vulnerable to the attacks but that's

639
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,980
what was used to exercise the detection

640
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,380
and response systems however if you

641
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,640
glanced at the report it looks like a

642
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,559
pen test report and it looks like we're

643
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,539
vulnerable to all these you know like a

644
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,640
legal team glancing at those reports

645
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,200
gonna be like

646
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,299
did you guys fix all these you guys fix

647
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,559
all these attacks that were vulnerable

648
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,360
to it no no no that's not that's not

649
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,640
what that was but the structure of the

650
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,580
report was such that it gave that

651
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,520
perspective and it it's it led to

652
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,740
confusion and we we had to we had to fix

653
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,600
the report on the back end but that was

654
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,220
a situation where I should have asked

655
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,659
for a sample report we should have

656
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,520
talked over it ahead of time and

657
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,020
resolved that so we weren't trying to

658
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,480
fix it afterwards

659
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,260
um that way the the report communicated

660
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,240
what we were trying to achieve and what

661
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,740
we actually achieved in the exercise

662
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,780
rather than looking like a pen test

663
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,440
Report with a whole bunch of unfixed

664
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,220
vulnerabilities that weren't really

665
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,940
vulnerabilities

666
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,059
that's you all right

667
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,520
so

668
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,960
so stepping into the consultant

669
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,520
perspective

670
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
um or the consultancy perspective I

671
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
think the one of the best things you can

672
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,159
do is you can tailor tailor the work to

673
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,659
the clients you know it's kind of

674
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,460
calls back to that initial talking about

675
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,820
goals you know engage with the client

676
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,299
talk about

677
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,500
talk about their environment talk about

678
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,960
what they want to do

679
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,220
talk about what they want to achieve

680
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,320
talk about how testing should be

681
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,120
performed where the focuses should be

682
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,279
where the risks are you know we already

683
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,260
talked about uh

684
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,880
um about reporting and tailoring

685
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,980
reporting

686
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,200
accordingly but I think transparency

687
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
about how the work is being done open

688
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,279
communication and respectful

689
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,159
communication of hey this is how we're

690
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
going to step through our process and

691
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,419
help you achieve your goals and deliver

692
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,000
that final high value report you know

693
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,460
it's it's it's critical and there's a

694
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,500
lot of companies that will

695
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,260
that will go through the initial stages

696
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,840
sign off on the work and then quietly do

697
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,299
the tests in the backgrounds and the the

698
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,580
tester is never actually on the phone

699
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,159
with like the blue team or the uh the

700
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,440
internal representatives and sometimes

701
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,120
that's okay you know sometimes as a

702
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,559
client you know it's it's a fairly

703
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,559
isolated test and you know if it's a web

704
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,200
app that's that we just need to you know

705
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
do our annual annual pen test or mobile

706
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,539
app where we don't need to necessarily

707
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,980
chat about it of course in the process

708
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,500
sometimes that like working in a box is

709
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,100
okay but if you're if you're doing an

710
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,100
internal pen test in a large Network and

711
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,539
uh

712
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,700
and scope is only so much but the

713
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,860
Network's massive and you're trying to

714
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,799
find out how best to use your time talk

715
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,020
to the client

716
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,100
you know have those discussions about

717
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
what the client wants to test you know

718
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,700
what are the areas of focus and what are

719
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,279
they concerned about and uh

720
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,200
and work through it adjust your

721
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
communication level to what the client

722
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,600
prefers you know some clients want start

723
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,659
and stop emails every day or an end of

724
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,580
the week wrap-up email saying hey we

725
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,240
tested all week long we found these high

726
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,100
value findings you know you'll get more

727
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,559
details in the report some clients don't

728
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,080
want to talk to the the Consultants at

729
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,179
all and that's okay too but have those

730
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,580
discussions ahead of time so you can get

731
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,400
out in front of uh in front of that and

732
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,440
make sure that you're fitting what the

733
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,500
client's expected

734
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,559
so uh we already touched quite a bit of

735
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,059
this one thing I do want to mention here

736
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,880
and it goes into the transparency slide

737
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,900
um

738
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,620
if you are

739
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,720
that's you

740
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,559
um

741
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,279
if you want a pen test to be done and

742
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,520
report to be delivered on December 31st

743
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,240
you may want to tell and schedule that

744
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,279
before December 25th

745
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,820
okay had a client a really big very big

746
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,159
name in the industries wanting a pen

747
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,539
test they were going live with the

748
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,880
product on January 1st but they came to

749
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,340
us end of the December like week or two

750
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,919
left we still got the pentas done okay

751
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,779
money money money

752
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:46,679
um but uh we had critical findings where

753
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,380
you could see patient data without

754
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,380
providing credentials on public internet

755
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,840
they still went live January 1st

756
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,500
okay so speak to the as a consultant

757
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,880
it's important for us to speak the

758
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,260
client about their goals and their

759
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,720
method and uh you know capabilities at

760
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,460
the same time speak to your own

761
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,740
capabilities about timing if you want a

762
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,320
good pen test go to the consulting firm

763
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,799
and have them do it in q1 or Q2

764
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,740
Q4 is a really busy time and the worst

765
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,600
time to do the pen test right we're

766
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,419
competing against PTO versus getting

767
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,640
billable hours and then you end up with

768
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,320
some places where we were in one place

769
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,340
where they're paying us extra as testers

770
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,980
to work as robbers okay so just be

771
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,840
careful with that

772
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,860
uh priced transparency all right price

773
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,120
this was a huge pet peeve for my oil

774
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
tried to run through it quickly so I'm

775
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,880
gonna try not to complain too much

776
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,580
that's uh there's there's a huge amount

777
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,140
of companies out there that will happily

778
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,760
hand you a code this is one pen test

779
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,380
fifty thousand dollars please and

780
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,880
there's no additional details no no

781
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,919
detailed statement will work just uh

782
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,659
yeah no we'll do that pen test and this

783
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,059
is how much it's going to charge

784
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,820
um but uh but as as we kind of talked

785
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,500
about it a little bit already on the

786
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,880
back end the price is almost always

787
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,799
determined by the number of hours worked

788
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,620
so one one thing that I've seen inside

789
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,220
inside the consulting firms is sometimes

790
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,200
the consulting firm will undercut their

791
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,520
competition

792
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,480
and slash engineering hours to to fit

793
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,340
that without making it transparent to

794
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,580
the customer so you know pen testing

795
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,159
from one you know quotes at 50 000 pen

796
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,779
testing firm two says oh they quoted

797
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,580
fifty thousand we'll do it for we'll do

798
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,640
it for thirty thousand and there's

799
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,700
without transparency the client may not

800
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,919
be aware that

801
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,260
you're getting the same deal on an

802
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,200
hour-by-hour basis yeah but you're just

803
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,380
not seeing those hours disappear

804
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,159
um

805
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,279
you know I needed 250 an hour one

806
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,860
engineer for 40 hours a week is ten

807
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,980
thousand dollars if uh if you get you

808
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,740
know client or Consulting for May I

809
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,980
think coach 10 000 and consulting firm B

810
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,340
uh quotes five thousand consolidate firm

811
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,340
B may present the same the same

812
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,500
statement of work but really they're

813
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,000
only putting 20 hours into that test

814
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,559
instead of 40. yeah I mean put the

815
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,500
number of hours what are the cost on the

816
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,100
sow let's be transmitted and there's I

817
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,419
don't think there's any good reason to

818
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,340
hide that breakdown so price

819
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,860
transparency is critical of me

820
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,779
um if I have to reverse engineer your

821
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,279
quote your statement will work to find

822
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,559
out like where that money is where my

823
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,200
money's going I'm gonna be annoyed at

824
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
the outside

825
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,159
um but uh but yeah that can be a little

826
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,380
bit of a red flag but it's it's fairly

827
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,520
common just to kind of Disguise it yeah

828
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,100
so uh one more thing in the console

829
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,200
important perspective and this really

830
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,179
dives into the next topic which is going

831
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,000
to be by the candidate perspective but

832
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,700
training and culture as consulting firms

833
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,320
one things that we often fail at is the

834
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,779
training perspective I've seen some

835
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,460
forms require things like you have to

836
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,000
have oscp to be a consultant I teach

837
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,919
oscp in the after hours and I can tell

838
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,179
you now

839
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,000
it doesn't create good Consultants it

840
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,620
doesn't create good pen testers all

841
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,260
right but across training among your

842
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,779
organization is great creating a culture

843
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,360
of positivity we've got a lot of

844
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,340
negativity in this industry you know we

845
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,620
are all leads we all feel like we know

846
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,399
the best we all have opinions on things

847
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,580
but when you do not have a culture of

848
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,799
collaboration you have a culture of

849
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,539
competition among your own employees and

850
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:40,799
that just creates a terrible work

851
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,500
environment right so as we talk about

852
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,480
that we jump into the interview red

853
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,799
flags

854
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,500
it's we're running a little short time

855
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,480
we'll run through this really quick

856
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,520
um so there's a couple more stories here

857
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,919
but I think I think really the the high

858
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,419
level takeaways here is if you're a

859
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:58,559
candidate if you're looking to get a job

860
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,840
with a consulting firm keep an eye on

861
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,700
the documentation keep an eye on what

862
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,620
they're offering you you know look at

863
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,679
look at ndas non-compete agreements as

864
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,419
you're walking in the door you know

865
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,159
those are pretty standard non-compete

866
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,320
Agreements are fairly standard ndas are

867
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,460
extremely standard because you're

868
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,080
dealing with sensitive information from

869
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,179
a bunch of different clients but keep an

870
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,220
eye on the time frame you know it

871
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,799
a five-year NDA you know is a little

872
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,380
unreasonable a three-year NDA might make

873
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,179
sense in some contexts but generally

874
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,519
like 12 months 12 months after leaving

875
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,100
the company is is my experience pretty

876
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,360
standard

877
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,220
um non-competes are pretty vicious too

878
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,519
especially in certain contexts sometimes

879
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,159
companies will put

880
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,260
unenforceable non-compete agreements in

881
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,539
the documentation that you sign you're

882
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,059
pressured in signing it and you know

883
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,159
it's got like I said unenforceable from

884
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,539
a legal standpoint but it's meant to

885
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,299
scare you it's meant to so I've seen

886
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,279
non-compete agreements that say that you

887
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,659
can you cannot go work for another

888
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,360
consulting firm for five years it's like

889
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,279
yeah and that's that's not really it's

890
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,539
state by state that's not really

891
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,060
something that can be enforced yeah but

892
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,320
the employee doesn't always know that

893
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,780
and so you feel like you're stuck in

894
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,940
this job and you can't go take those

895
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,500
skills elsewhere when you discover that

896
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,000
as a highly toxic workplace and you want

897
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
to leave

898
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,879
um if you're in the interview process

899
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,040
and they're disrespecting your time or

900
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,179
if you're unable to meet with your

901
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,800
future team or your future manager those

902
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,080
are huge red flags you know keep an eye

903
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,300
out for those an interview should always

904
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,460
be a two-way street it should always be

905
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,440
mutually respectful and a good

906
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,099
productive conversation if it's

907
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:41,159
if it's six interviews of them grilling

908
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,960
you on technical skills and you never

909
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,460
get to actually meet the people you

910
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,960
ground will be working with or working

911
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,899
for uh maybe go find something else

912
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,879
there's a whole lot of openings in the

913
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,679
field

914
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,020
um grilling the interviewee is is a

915
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,200
serious problem or uh being elitist if

916
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,660
you walk into an interview in the uh in

917
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,020
the interviewer is is elitist like no no

918
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,839
just don't put up with that go uh go

919
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,280
hunt some more somewhere else yeah and

920
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,140
you know what turn it around ask the

921
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,520
hiring manager when was the last time

922
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,760
they took PTO right I asked them when

923
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,720
was the last time they went for a

924
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,460
training

925
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,440
um why are you hiding right now did you

926
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
have layoffs recently it's a two-way

927
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,260
interview why not okay so

928
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,359
as you are going to the interview

929
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,540
process assess the employer also

930
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,339
think about the reputation check glass

931
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,740
door glass door is great place for you

932
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,660
to see sort of Yelp reviews for

933
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,400
employers

934
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,160
um what kind of Technology do they use I

935
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,380
was working at a place where I was using

936
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,920
a Dell Inspiron

937
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,619
for my pen testing I will do pen testing

938
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,540
the daytime and I would take it to my

939
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,920
hotel room in the evening and it would

940
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,079
be cracking passwords okay while I'm

941
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,160
sleeping and it's running in the

942
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,380
background tracking passwords the hotel

943
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,060
didn't have a heat bill because my

944
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,579
laptop was hitting the room up but uh it

945
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:03,900
was terrible

946
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,579
and then I would use the same laptop to

947
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,140
run NASA scans

948
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,940
as I'm writing report for the previous

949
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,520
client so think about that what kind of

950
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,160
Technology are they using internally

951
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,500
um how often are the double triple

952
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,119
booked on an engagement

953
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,540
that's a that's a big red flag okay

954
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,000
um and what is the billable goal if

955
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,740
their billable goal which is the goal

956
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,180
for you how many hours you spend on a

957
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,119
client engagement if it's 100 well when

958
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,640
do I go to the bathroom all right so

959
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,740
think about and ask those questions

960
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,960
directly because they're gonna have a

961
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,260
big role in your work there most

962
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,060
consulting firms should have a very

963
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,560
specific billable goal that they're

964
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,540
targeting for any consultant working for

965
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,119
them and 80 is generally a good number

966
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,980
it's probably the highest I would go for

967
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,320
60 to 80 yeah you start going north of

968
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,140
80 and you're stressing out and you know

969
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,420
overworking people you're pushing them

970
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,280
in the 50 60 hour weeks because when you

971
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,619
take PTO you're not billable yeah

972
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,880
so

973
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,820
in conclusion you know beans have been

974
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,960
spilled it's kind of hard to see in

975
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,820
there I love that picture yeah but

976
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,099
always look for transparency both client

977
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,839
and the consultant okay and the

978
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,000
candidate look for transparency in there

979
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,480
I think that's it

980
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,800
um

981
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,839
five minutes for questions and we've got

982
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,160
some stickers and business cards in here

983
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,440
if you want any but questions

984
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,280
no no and so the question was uh asking

985
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,020
about the project manager on from The

986
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,780
consultancy Firm during those initial

987
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,420
conversations I would say so long as a

988
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,000
project manager is present that's that's

989
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,800
a good sign it's it's when you're going

990
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,780
through those sales and early

991
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,700
engineering discussions and building out

992
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,320
the scope of work if there's no project

993
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,000
manager present

994
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,740
um then you maybe want to ask about it

995
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,440
but uh depending on your circumstance

996
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
you might want to ask for specific PM

997
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,760
yeah I have some more questions there

998
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,520
but uh I think the biggest word flag for

999
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,320
me is when we start having those

1000
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,240
discussions and the project managers

1001
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,700
just non-existent yeah that author tells

1002
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,859
me they don't have project managers or

1003
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,420
they've got a very limited project

1004
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,160
management team and there could be some

1005
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,640
disorganization there is no industry in

1006
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,380
the world that has more ADHD than pen

1007
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,560
testers all right you you expect others

1008
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,420
to manage our time not going to happen

1009
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,119
okay if it was up to me I would never

1010
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,680
stop and testing which means I will

1011
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,079
never end up writing a report which I'll

1012
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,500
I nobody loves writing a report okay so

1013
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,900
project manager plays a very important

1014
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,579
role in that making sure things are on

1015
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,040
time making sure that we are delivering

1016
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,140
on time making sure that goals are met

1017
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,020
of the test so it's definitely a

1018
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,579
dedicated product manager not

1019
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,079
necessarily a product manager specific

1020
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,700
to that client maybe they're taking on

1021
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,700
10 clients but their job is to make sure

1022
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,980
that goals are met and timelines are bad

1023
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,000
that yeah are there any uh projects that

1024
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,140
make you stand out more

1025
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,880
you want to take that one sure the

1026
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,200
question is are there any projects that

1027
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,599
make you stand out more at as a

1028
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,940
candidate uh one of those is right now

1029
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,800
right here you're at a conference

1030
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,680
right it's it's a little difficult to

1031
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,900
show your work in pen testing than it

1032
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,700
may be in development okay you don't

1033
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,579
have a portfolio that you can chill but

1034
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,859
doing things like hack the Box try hack

1035
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,079
me and most importantly being at a

1036
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,339
conference especially a small conference

1037
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:44,180
like B size amazing place for hiring

1038
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,960
there are probably a lot of hiding

1039
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,700
managers in here right now a lot of

1040
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,760
candidates in here right now and also

1041
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,320
one thing I would recommend for

1042
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,880
everybody wanting to get their own pen

1043
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,040
testing figure out a way to present at a

1044
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,440
conference everybody has something to

1045
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,660
share we all do we may feel like we

1046
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,940
don't but we all have something to share

1047
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,920
or at least do what we are doing stand

1048
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,260
up and just complain right these are all

1049
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,940
the terrible firms I tried to get hired

1050
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,800
by yeah but definitely find a way to

1051
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,740
present Duke ctfs

1052
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,839
um and most of all make connections to

1053
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,880
people as I'd say as a hiring manager

1054
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,260
one of the things that I love to hear

1055
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,540
most from a prospective candidate is

1056
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,339
like a passion project something

1057
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,760
technical either from a previous job or

1058
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,380
something outside something you're

1059
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,020
excited about that's it's Technical and

1060
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,820
just something that you can just ramble

1061
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,800
on and on about because I'll let you go

1062
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,339
and just listen yeah because the passion

1063
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,380
is the passion is really important you

1064
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,660
know technical skills you know details

1065
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,280
can be learned along the way they can be

1066
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,859
trained but uh that that drive is huge

1067
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:53,779
well one last question yeah go ahead

1068
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:00,420
so the question is what are your

1069
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,700
thoughts about clients requesting in

1070
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,859
ndas for the testers for that project

1071
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,040
oh

1072
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,880
I'm not allowed to talk about that so

1073
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,820
the question is the tests are signing an

1074
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,240
NDA individually for the client

1075
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,280
um so as a hiding manager as a manager

1076
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,079
inside a consulting firm I would push

1077
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,480
back against that right I'm not having

1078
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,000
my tester sign an idea to you for two

1079
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,040
reasons one I don't know if that tester

1080
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,839
is gonna do the test for you

1081
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,300
things can change maybe they need a PTO

1082
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,040
right at last minute maybe they end up

1083
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,740
in a hospital okay so that's gonna be a

1084
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,480
nightmare in terms of scheduling because

1085
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,099
now we have to find another tester to

1086
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,260
sign in any a second I'm gonna lose

1087
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,420
people if I ask them to sign ndas with a

1088
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,339
client individually because now they're

1089
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,380
individually responsible

1090
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,240
so that the legal backing of the company

1091
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,400
gets getting muddy water in there

1092
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,980
uh I mean I sometimes have clients asked

1093
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,720
me to do a background check for a tester

1094
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,240
from them and that's that's a pain yeah

1095
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,220
MBA is going to be even bigger pain yeah

1096
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,380
yeah I think the the request for

1097
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,700
individual background checks and the

1098
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,339
repressor individual ndas have fallen to

1099
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,980
similar bucket and in my experience I've

1100
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,880
seen I've seen testers refuse because I

1101
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,859
mean from a legal standpoint the

1102
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,540
relationship between the two companies

1103
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,460
there's an overarching NDA that should

1104
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,880
cover everything and most clients 90 of

1105
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,980
clients are happy with that I think some

1106
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,020
clients do get specific they get picky

1107
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,339
they want to run individual background

1108
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,920
checks and new individual ndas but that

1109
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,200
that gets messy real quick all right I'm

1110
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,880
with Q I would push back against that

1111
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,460
but it does happen and sometimes

1112
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,619
sometimes your consultancy firm and

1113
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,599
you've got a multi-million dollar client

1114
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,700
that's throwing their weight around and

1115
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,980
you have to play ball it's and it's a

1116
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,800
rough situation but uh I said I'm

1117
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,420
opposed to it but sometimes it's just

1118
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,040
the reality of working with really big

1119
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,900
companies

1120
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,420
all right thanks everybody uh we got

1121
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,720
stickers

1122
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,160
take the stickers you need to get rid of

1123
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,560
stickers yeah I'm going to get rid of

1124
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,920
the stickers
