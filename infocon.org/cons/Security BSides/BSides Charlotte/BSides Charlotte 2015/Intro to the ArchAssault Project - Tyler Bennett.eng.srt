1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,360
we're good volumes good all right

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,879
so as you said my name is Tyler Bennett

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:18,490
I am one of the main artists all

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,890
developers been doing this for about a

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,130
year and a half so far we don't plan on

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:37,120
stopping anytime sir so what you know

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,040
what is our clinics does anybody know

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,070
does anybody else use it here all right

9
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,410
you guys plan on adding the repos when

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:51,310
you get home or right now all right so

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,260
we use our clinics because we find that

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,840
it's a lot more lightweight than say

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,989
Debbie Andrew Kalley or fit over any of

14
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,100
those we find that a lot of users have a

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,840
lot of their more issues with it because

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,350
most users are used to being handled by

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,549
Debbie and that's obviously an opinion

18
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,960
but that's my opinion to have so we find

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,580
that a lot of people enjoy enjoy harsh

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,229
because lightweight is fast you can

21
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:27,460
install exactly what you need and

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,950
nothing more so we are a layer on top of

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:39,150
arch linux linux harm we support i 680

24
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,510
666 Buddha x86 64 and arm v6 and rb7 so

25
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,640
all of the Armed b6 and RB seven boards

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,100
arch linux arm supports you can easily

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,770
drop our layer on top of it and install

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,479
whatever you would like from the

29
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,670
repository we work very closely with dr.

30
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,040
Nix armed with arch linux developers to

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,580
try to maintain a very stable and

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,169
try to form a symbiotic relationship

33
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,150
between the two so that you can easily

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,040
just drop our positive right on top of

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,250
them and grab any tools you need being

36
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,490
built to the standards of cars legs and

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,630
arch linux armament because they follow

38
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,040
arch linux that being said we we follow

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,510
their standards so we don't have an

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,040
installer because we use pack strapped

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,900
we do that because we believe that we

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,880
want to keep it simple stupid your focus

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,640
philosophy yeah

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,750
so what is this all those kind of funny

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,310
everyone you know right so I like to

46
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,430
define us as a fully customizable arch

47
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,000
linux distro for security professionals

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,070
on the bleeding edge so I kind of thumb

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,600
that one so we're fully customizable you

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,650
know we don't have you we don't give you

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,430
will give you know them and say okay

52
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,560
here's gnome it's all you need to use we

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,940
let you put whatever you want on there

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,590
give you a little tools you need to do

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,420
what you need to do and obviously we've

56
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,060
built our clinic standards trains that

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,060
we follow their philosophy very closely

58
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,739
we package all of our package directly

59
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,540
to their their philosophy their

60
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,900
guidelines so that means that for

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,680
example if you try to install a package

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,000
you can easily move that package without

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,220
having to worry about it messing up your

64
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,530
system because it's packaged correctly

65
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,730
obviously as i said we support 32-bit

66
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,520
64-bit and RB 6 and rb7 so that means we

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,480
support drones so one of my other

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,770
developers is a big drone fanatic he's

69
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,120
actually been building drones for

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,130
probably 15 years now a very long time

71
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,940
and he started taking our distribution

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,089
and dropping it on to embedded devices

73
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,860
such as a otras see one or a big warm

74
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,070
beaglebone black and it's actually an

75
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,200
adaptor different antennas you know USB

76
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,480
/ tooth all that kind of stuff scripting

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,580
everything out and then flying it around

78
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,940
and capturing all impatient he needs and

79
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,720
then flying away at all using a using a

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,210
an autopilot to be able to fly in and

81
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,340
fly out so you can fly and grab what he

82
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,260
needs fly away for anyone knows so the

83
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,780
idea behind that is so you would you

84
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,290
know build a drone that would say go

85
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,570
target an office building goes and flies

86
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,100
on top of the office building and lands

87
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,320
being on battery power urgent solar

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,920
powered land sits down does everything

89
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,770
is new start scanning grabs order needs

90
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,490
flies away and ever in D you came by

91
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,180
unless to check the top of the building

92
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,219
so

93
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:27,659
so how do we do this well we do

94
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,749
everything via get we have multiple git

95
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:35,610
repos we're on github we're on bitbucket

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,009
and we're on cute lab we've tried to

97
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,210
move things around a few times because

98
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,279
we like to keep our git repos private

99
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,289
special development repo mainly because

100
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,810
someone sooner just copy us then why are

101
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,870
we doing this so we try to keep things

102
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,400
back a little bit so someone can't just

103
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:05,210
pull it again so we utilize named cap

104
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,090
named cap is a artists Linux tool they

105
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,330
wrote to make sure that each package

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,240
build is built to resort to standards

107
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,990
that they they invited to so for example

108
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,349
AC based program that we compile if we

109
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:28,080
forget a library when we named cap that

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,990
tar ball that it builds it's going to

111
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,830
show it we're missing you know I'm going

112
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,819
to live ISL and we decided in recompile

113
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,490
it and everything's done but that make

114
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,589
sure that we maintain their standards

115
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:49,740
directly so clean truths so the arts

116
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,319
learning standards maintain that each

117
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
package is built in a clean trudat

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,899
environment which means that basically

119
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,210
install a base which is all of your

120
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,089
development libraries GCC make all that

121
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,939
and then your package bill is going to

122
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,520
pull in all the dependencies and needs

123
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,839
so if the package bill doesn't build

124
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,360
correctly and a claims route we don't

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,969
push the package because that ensures

126
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,860
that the package is not correct needs to

127
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,770
be fixed

128
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,710
Oh obviously falling standards again so

129
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:31,550
why do we do this why not we do this

130
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,970
because we can we we enjoy ashlynne

131
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,949
extent IM phone sec and we enjoy

132
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,340
breaking things and hacking things if

133
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,569
nobody use this we would still do this

134
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,300
as per own ends because we really love

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,909
what we do very passionate about it so I

136
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,440
686 why do we support a 686 well we

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,630
again we try to follow arsenic standards

138
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,780
and parcel Enix still supports it so do

139
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,500
we they drop it out we'll drop it out

140
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,669
mainly will do as well packages that way

141
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,580
but that's the other there obviously

142
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,770
it's a 32-bit architecture we all know

143
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,710
that runs on a lot of embedded devices

144
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,789
all of the arm v6 and RV 7 or 32-bit

145
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,560
there's no 64-bit ARM right now if you

146
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,000
are v8 when it comes out so we have x 86

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,819
x86 64 support as well obviously

148
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,630
everyone one 64 bit now when we utilize

149
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,000
64-bit support we have to make sure we

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,190
include multi-layer because a lot of

151
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,219
these tools are built specifically with

152
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,880
32-bit libraries we don't include 32-bit

153
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,410
we don't include 30 multi-level you will

154
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,959
not get its 32 pages you see to compile

155
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,490
that one package you want to build

156
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,700
correctly on 64-bit GCC

157
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,560
so arm so we've arrived pretty heavily

158
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,340
on the arch linux arm developers to

159
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,430
maintain and build Arch Linux arm and

160
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,560
that allows us to again be an easier

161
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,840
layer on top of our on top of their

162
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,420
distribution we work very close with

163
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,860
those guys all the time to ensure that

164
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,950
everything is working correctly if we

165
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,370
have certain issues we will patch it and

166
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,340
submit up to them or we will just put a

167
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,790
patch in it and go on perfect example

168
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,340
the other day we're trying to get prints

169
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,120
processor working on art and the

170
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,850
developer that built prints processor he

171
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,220
did not immediately make it available

172
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,150
for arm so we had to make patches inside

173
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,310
of it to allow it to install correctly

174
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,220
on arm and then he made some changes

175
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,660
have broke it then we got rid of the

176
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,130
horn horn but that's not the point so we

177
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,720
make as many practices of candidate

178
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,970
things to keep things working and then

179
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,320
because we are a small team if they

180
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,800
eventually are too much a hassle we will

181
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,260
put it aside put any stage and put it

182
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,930
away for a while maybe remove repos that

183
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,400
are broken it until they can fix it at a

184
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,710
later date I have someone really

185
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,410
requested and really wanted it fixed we

186
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,790
bust our butts to get it working

187
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,209
correctly

188
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,990
obviously again with both of their

189
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,240
standards so arm v7 arm v7 is our main

190
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,390
bread and butter there's a lot of

191
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,660
devices now that our arm v7 and arm v7

192
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,550
means that they are a multi-core device

193
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,450
I believe it's quad core is an arm v7

194
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,210
device that's as a standard now there's

195
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,550
still 32 bit there's no 64-bit ARM

196
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,650
devices as it is ton as far as I know

197
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,130
and obviously we support Oh droid not

198
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,070
dr. PI the additional thread with a

199
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,360
foundation we try to look at the more

200
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,140
happy more or less or knowing our view 7

201
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,930
devices out there Sherlock your lab had

202
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,190
ever noticed a given heard much about

203
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,400
the droid see one it's a very

204
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,290
interesting advice we we started

205
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,070
building with it and it's scott gig

206
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,750
nicks its gig of ram and it's a

207
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,340
quad-core processor it's able to handle

208
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,960
dual help us at one time at the same

209
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,140
time capturing for over 48 hours without

210
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,930
a glitch while at the same time

211
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,170
stretching the CPUs up to load of 30 was

212
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,600
still having 90 megs of ram I'd say

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,730
that's probably pretty good on a device

214
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,470
that only takes a max with two amps of

215
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,920
power so you can easily power at via via

216
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,770
like a 5000 milliamp lipo battery

217
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,290
probably powered for two or three days

218
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,360
we haven't tested any of that of course

219
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,040
but theoretically could be possible I'll

220
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,070
be louder project more okay sorry

221
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,760
everyone kind of talking to front row

222
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,980
you know

223
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,360
he so we talked about multi-core again

224
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,600
standards already questions down that

225
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,560
that's not good I should make more more

226
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,350
to go on yeah yeah so I have a few

227
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:57,970
devices here oh you ready so aim shoot

228
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,600
click so this obviously is a alpha 2.4

229
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,730
gigahertz omnidirectional 5dbi antenna

230
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,310
nothing fancy just something fun to play

231
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,060
with we have another one from simple

232
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,910
Wi-Fi same kind of thing we really liked

233
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,700
them a lot there i bought few things

234
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,710
from them i don't have anything else up

235
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,170
here from them but some really nice

236
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,440
device actually fine arts els dr this is

237
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,290
a software-defined radio that can sniff

238
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,970
gsm FM all kinds of signals out of thin

239
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,430
air I believe the arch linux arm guys

240
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:47,650
are you using it for pulling the radio

241
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,290
signals from the airport and graphite

242
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,650
navy a waterfall device that's kind of

243
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,069
cool right

244
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,550
and obviously we had the droid see one

245
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,500
it's the kick of skate of ram only a

246
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,200
quad-core processor it's got four USB

247
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,880
ports so you can hook up probably

248
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,040
possibly four antennas to a 44 Wi-Fi

249
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
adapters do it attack four different

250
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,330
networks at one time it only does 500

251
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,000
milliamps on USB so may run into some

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
issues maybe not powerful enough but

253
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,959
we'll have to do some further testing

254
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,390
but obviously have more outflows for

255
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,690
wireless taxes / wants access points and

256
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,660
hot spots and I'll just pack an

257
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,450
injection all of these are fully as a

258
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,080
board inside of our kernel as well as

259
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,700
the main line arch linux kernel by now

260
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:51,140
because it's on 405 i believe so we have

261
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,510
this USB arm raise anybody variance

262
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,980
before but he ever seen it so if we have

263
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,540
all the stuff the tables we can't see we

264
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,380
can see more things when you combine

265
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,459
this is a dual-core 512 megs of ram a

266
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,529
USB stick she could plug in you can

267
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,480
actually boot off this this is running

268
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,300
arch linux arm so live is configured

269
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,089
right now to be a fake mirror of our

270
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,790
repository so you can put this into a

271
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,740
computer boot off of it you can actually

272
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,270
download all of our packages as it

273
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,610
currently exists in our repo from this

274
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,500
device right here completely offline we

275
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,940
work with those of these guys easier for

276
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,950
Kaiser trains for his path you can pick

277
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,589
this up by a crowd supply anyone's cares

278
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,070
about 140 bucks really recommend them

279
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,540
they're really really nice guys

280
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,160
so now we have a Shakira from exhibitor

281
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,270
so new device have been playing with to

282
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,390
work on embedded systems so it handles

283
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:07,540
you are to sip and jtag and one more

284
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,690
protocol I forget so recently I use this

285
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,510
to I pulled the case off by ubiquity ap

286
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,510
and you lot and uh basically you aren't

287
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,600
into it and Kosta he was able to root it

288
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,580
and pull off the image and then wipe it

289
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,980
with up and worked because ubiquity JP

290
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:40,780
stuff is so so make sure everyone's seen

291
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,750
the hack RF sorry so that car f is a

292
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,840
device for pulling RF signals I believe

293
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,340
it does GS gsm and Wi-Fi as well it's

294
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,110
pretty expensive but it's also I same

295
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,600
guys to make the uber tooth I don't have

296
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,980
that up here but we do have one at the

297
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,190
booth

298
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,810
cantina everyone's bio standings before

299
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,730
this is a professional one from simple

300
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,369
Wi-Fi I didn't buy it to measure exactly

301
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,339
what it costs but pretty nice gives you

302
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,709
a very wide range it's a uni-directional

303
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,350
anybody have any questions I didn't

304
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:44,360
answer or anything yes yeah so so the

305
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,940
live CD outside is our full install at

306
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,890
full repo installed about 16 gigs fully

307
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:58,490
installed and that's about you count on

308
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,790
Linux plus 0 is it's probably about 2300

309
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,480
packages on that CD that makes a 32 bit

310
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,680
about 3.9 gigs in 64 bit ly multi live

311
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:16,160
is about 4.3 but it's a live CD running

312
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,400
open box you can you know it's got

313
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Firefox it's got tour it's got pretty

314
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,930
mature thing to you can install off of

315
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,580
it you can do whatever you want to do

316
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,610
with it you can play with it we don't

317
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,550
have any persistent rees like that yet

318
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,990
we are working towards adding resistance

319
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,240
there's an issue because the squash FS

320
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,000
the holds all the packages is it 32 gigs

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,550
and the way arch linux works is it

322
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,050
actually wants to take the whole squash

323
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,100
FS and load it onto a USB stick or hard

324
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,720
drive or something of that nature and

325
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,450
then we actually have to label that

326
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,640
device so the each time you would you

327
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,020
would want to have persistence you have

328
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,030
to actually have a specific label device

329
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,950
label on your system and be able to have

330
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,220
persistence so we haven't quite figured

331
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,720
that out yet

332
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,730
it's also in line with using forensics

333
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,350
mode we working on the forensics option

334
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,420
as well you can copy whole entire squad

335
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,850
chef has to ram problem is that it's

336
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,520
quite large you have to add 32 gigs of

337
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,950
ram just to be a little of the image

338
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,870
that's a massive amount i forgot i

339
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,250
missed a few things so i bought is all

340
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,820
kind of ramble for a second so we do

341
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,360
have a custom kernel our live see runs

342
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,410
our custom kernel which is 318 to hit it

343
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,670
sorry I thought someone said something

344
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,520
it maintains all the cali patches are

345
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,410
built right into it so all the Wi-Fi

346
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,030
injection patches or baked right into

347
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,560
the end of the city into the kernel so

348
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,460
in doing that we have to maintain

349
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,760
actually maintain VirtualBox modules a

350
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,180
few other kernel modules for think are

351
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:11,880
eight 169 the nic driver we support the

352
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,340
same same kernel modules in arvin kernel

353
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,550
that the linux LTS package pulls into

354
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,120
their pairs

355
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,900
and we make that the default kernel when

356
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,370
you boot from our ISO but as you said

357
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,040
since we're on like 405 most of the fact

358
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,680
most of the Wi-Fi cards are support of a

359
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,900
full packet injection already in main

360
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,330
line and if they're not probably using

361
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:44,130
something very obscure anything else ya

362
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,630
go you're in the back

363
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,170
we would love it if people would be able

364
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,520
to commit and help out I will say this

365
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,230
we've had issues where people I've

366
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,000
committed and they we criticize what

367
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,960
they do because they don't follow

368
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,270
standards and then they drop off the

369
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,310
face of the earth so I would say don't

370
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:26,220
do that we we hold our old registro to

371
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,590
or to high standards and we we will

372
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,390
throw criticism back if something's not

373
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,390
right but we're trying to give creative

374
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,850
and destructive criticism not yelling at

375
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,180
you for doing it wrong if you want to do

376
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,790
that you can do all that via our github

377
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,360
for gate pull it and make any changes

378
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,950
you want find any fixes you know let us

379
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,800
know we have a bug server way of bugs

380
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,770
arts org remember wiki server which eyes

381
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,350
are wicked paid to the different tools

382
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,690
some of the things that we don't do so

383
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,350
like like metasploit in cali they

384
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,150
automatically enable you to be able to

385
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,310
connect to connect via to the Postgres

386
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,350
database we don't send any of that up

387
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,740
for you so it's basically just standard

388
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,380
metasploit now you can you set that up

389
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,290
we have instructions do that on our wiki

390
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,580
then you can connect competition to it

391
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,190
or teams boy what everyone to do from

392
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,950
there anything else

393
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,399
anything else anyone again

394
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,510
well you can easily find us an RC r on

395
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:03,809
irc.freenode.net if you have a specific

396
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,490
calmer device but maybe don't support or

397
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,900
you want to see supported you can easily

398
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,690
put a put it in our bug tracker all you

399
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,059
guys do is register an account submit

400
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,190
the bug we'll get back to you we usually

401
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,650
pray prompt one thing that a lot of

402
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,380
people say is that you know most of most

403
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,429
secure distributions are really not are

404
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,260
not supported very well when you find

405
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,679
any plug in a package it might take four

406
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,250
months for to get fixed but I'm

407
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,950
literally online every day so if you

408
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,690
find a bug you find an issue i will

409
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,650
probably see to it and answer it within

410
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,840
20 minutes usually that's a little

411
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,100
excessive but i do actually have a job

412
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,549
so you know but I mean I'm when I'm

413
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:50,130
trying to convey is that we really care

414
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,480
about this project you know you guys

415
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,160
find any issues you know please let us

416
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,169
know don't just throw your hands up in

417
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,200
the air and say oh this is stupid you

418
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,760
know if you let us know we can't make it

419
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,429
better without you guys because we don't

420
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:03,750
know we can't fix we don't know it's

421
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,410
broken you were tweeting me before I

422
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,280
even finish downloading the ISO I mean

423
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,929
yeah I mean I basically sat outside of

424
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:18,900
my booth on Twitter and on our city all

425
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,000
day long it's been quiet but been

426
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,260
watching things should see what's going

427
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,600
on obviously everyone's here is why

428
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,678
didn't it be online right

429
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,800
especially how many of you are using

430
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,250
like a VPS or a limited hardware for

431
00:24:45,250 --> 00:25:03,370
your runs better than any other arch

432
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,930
does have his people learning curve but

433
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,600
don't let that stop seriously get out

434
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:16,260
there he's not selling himself over

435
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,410
lease the project he had him to the

436
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,600
repos before I could you know pull the

437
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,040
image down and so these guys are very

438
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,810
fast RC get on

439
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,240
he had been there for a long time

440
00:25:47,240 --> 00:26:05,309
cleaning gone or we'll see post link in

441
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,200
it or something videos asking for it

442
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,029
that it's not there really quick I'm

443
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,700
seeing like two and three updates a day

444
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,980
to their repos so I I don't usually

445
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,830
strong I still have my solid tools that

446
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,929
I use but i will say like why not have

447
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:21,000
something i just can't find or can work

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,960
anywhere else my oxen is there so it's a

449
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,429
great place to go and try the tools

450
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:28,200
especially before they get increases

451
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,730
more mature disproves did you get the

452
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,390
numbers based on the packages compared

453
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,890
to what callier so II we've done a

454
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,840
little numbers and so Kelly shows the

455
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,100
actual to list and that basically

456
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,559
maintains every single tool they have

457
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:48,270
except for dependencies and we build

458
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,649
them out of the water by about 600

459
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,960
packages now we have a lot of

460
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,490
community-based tools will pull in

461
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,590
things that you know simple Python

462
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,570
script it does you know we're press

463
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,700
skating will easily pull it in because

464
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,070
we support the community as a whole now

465
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,260
as you said it's always changing so we

466
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,090
always have to work very fast to make

467
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,130
sure that we are supporting make sure

468
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,500
that's up there if you find any cool

469
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,590
tools let us know we'll figure it out

470
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,709
simple as that

471
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,840
you mean from the ISO perspective yeah

472
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,690
yeah I saw has all of them yes now we do

473
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,660
that so that you can't say oh I tried to

474
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,240
use I so I didn't have this tool that

475
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,460
way it's all there we have different

476
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,600
categories for everything but we usually

477
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,730
put we categorize every tool based on

478
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,330
the type of tool is you know wireless

479
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,240
steganography cryptography whatever we

480
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,500
try to make sure that all of our tools

481
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,690
are the correct groups we have any tools

482
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,210
in the wrong groups let us know we'll

483
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,010
fix fix things we try to work on that

484
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,780
that's a lot of work cuz you got

485
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:20,260
actually rebuild all those packages when

486
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,270
you do the actual to disk install it's

487
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:28,060
just well that's what keeps a

488
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,800
lightweight yeah it's gonna sailing eats

489
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,790
so if you have some scripts the answer

490
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,110
different options be installed you

491
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,470
choose but that's pretty much the

492
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,440
default right yeah we that's basically

493
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,030
default on fox linux is it's basically

494
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,330
just a if everyone's ever used a dead

495
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,910
man's boots boot strap same kind of way

496
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,670
it just basically puts all the packages

497
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,910
on 28 routed environment and you build

498
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,860
everything out on that so like what I

499
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,050
build a server I can literally build my

500
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,250
I can go from clean dis all the way to

501
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,490
fully installed about 10 minutes mainly

502
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,660
because I already know exactly what i

503
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,000
need aren't everything configured drop

504
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,530
it on that I can reboot those reboot of

505
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,800
that disk and there is the environment

506
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,950
