1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,280
so I try to keep this short in this 200

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,920
slides really quick about my

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,780
that's me many years ago i've done pen

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,300
testing red teaming wargaming i have a

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,369
different industry than some people I've

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,080
worked in retail or working in retail

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,570
and finance I have also worked in local

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,029
government but in addition I spent 17

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,180
years in the United States military I

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,529
started a computer as many years ago on

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,840
stuff like this and then somehow ended

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,400
up doing stuff like this if you don't

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,660
know what a corpsman is especially

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,340
marine corpsman they're pretty much

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,110
double docs they look kind of funny and

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,090
they stand out but you tell them you

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,140
tell marina de about their dog so when

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,280
the peacetime was around when there

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,690
wasn't bad things I played games like

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,640
this played with nuclear biological

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,510
chemical warfare hot days and prepared

22
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:04,190
for disasters like this good good good

23
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,580
you all wanna know really what this is

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,770
about talking about four games and one

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,909
of the things that always happens either

26
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,010
the military local government or

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,450
anything else if you're not talking the

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,539
same speak how do you know if you're

29
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,920
still talking to same stuff we could go

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,270
out there and talk to linux people and

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,619
then you have a Microsoft person to

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,909
spend more time trying to figure out

33
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,950
just the commonalities and the

34
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,939
differences than anything else so it was

35
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,109
we dive into that we'll talk about what

36
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,719
a red team is and you want to hire one

37
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,750
again back to that level setting we've

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,340
got vulnerability scanning we've got pen

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,899
testing we've got red teaming right here

40
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,070
is probably where some people get a

41
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,299
little heart there hurts feel it

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,310
feelings but I wanted to define this for

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,439
this conversation as well as the people

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,109
we work with I heard mojo talk about how

45
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,570
many people know about pen testing it's

46
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,670
not a common thing so we're going to

47
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,840
break this down we'll talk a little

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,100
about their skill sets and their

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,380
advantages not saying any of this is not

50
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,530
valuable but they have their place

51
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,280
vulnerability scanning is usually

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,140
general to specialize depending on what

53
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,788
you're going back for mediating

54
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,919
troubleshooting that understanding its

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,420
automated you can go it across the

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,520
enterprise it's fast but it's usually

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,870
around an application or some type of

58
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,670
software it's not going to do all the

59
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,740
other things and its signature dependent

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,569
just like antivirus it's what's been

61
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,080
defined there's an 0 0 day we get a

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,340
little bit deeper into the thing we've

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,130
got pen test

64
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,780
can be general can also go into

65
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,340
specialized areas there are some people

66
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,080
in here that have skill sets that I will

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,730
not even touch I will never say I'm an

68
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,280
expert in anything it's crossbred it's

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,690
got an automation it's got manual

70
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,840
testing it does do physical and human as

71
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,280
we've already talked about social

72
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,770
engineer but it's always that cause the

73
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,510
end result is really around information

74
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,030
security it's slow and low the

75
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,280
challenges is the scoping a lot of times

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,330
they want this done in one or two weeks

77
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,430
you have to learn environment turn back

78
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,260
around and explain it to someone in two

79
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,080
weeks very hard to do and there are many

80
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,090
well defined industries out there have

81
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,590
done this if you're looking for if you

82
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,880
haven't done any of this i definitely

83
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,950
look up some of these it's defined

84
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,010
doesn't mean it's in a box just means

85
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,260
it's defined then we get into red

86
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,000
teaming red team is a total different

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
animal this comes actually from the

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,450
military comes back more from the Cold

89
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,370
War red versus blue and actually having

90
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,260
that fight this is where they bring in

91
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,240
everything this is that full a team this

92
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,340
is orchestrated this is not just one one

93
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,510
team this could be a multiple aspect

94
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,000
ronik ethnicity I'll use that word so

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,690
someone can drink cyber side as well as

96
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:47,410
physical they do human engagement to

97
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,110
mimic that they also do opt for which is

98
00:03:50,110 --> 00:04:37,780
operational form immense

99
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,500
these or other military forces and they

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,780
act like in Iraqi or Russia or whatever

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,370
but this is everything social

102
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,750
engineering and what you're going to

103
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,240
touch making sure that when you get

104
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,400
broken into and all your stuff stolen

105
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,950
you're already prepared but we also find

106
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,320
haystacks we find those needles but we

107
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,990
also find those huge areas make excess

108
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,460
of center of gravity that will take down

109
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,350
that one application that's been sitting

110
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,490
in the back end no one's paying

111
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,530
attention to because you know what it's

112
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,450
running it's an old mainframe you take

113
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,919
it down guess what you can't do your

114
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,510
business we also find those elephants

115
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,470
one other thing I'll talk about the

116
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,150
shortly there's a little side off of it

117
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,020
depending on where you come from

118
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,770
vulnerability scanning is what

119
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,660
penetration testing is what red teaming

120
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,870
is question is are you ready or are you

121
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,470
not I can't tell you that I'm not going

122
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,150
to tell you exactly what a red team is

123
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,430
to to make it to find it's going to be

124
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,000
what you need however you need to know

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,289
thyself not really just anything else

126
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,310
you need to know exactly what your

127
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,990
business does if you have no idea what

128
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,130
your business does you're already

129
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,590
failing you also need to know where

130
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,360
everything is as well as where your

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,539
controls are and have them deployed and

132
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,180
yes we've all seen this horrible thing

133
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,400
and we all know at cissp and it's chuck

134
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,680
norris approved as well but there's

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,960
other things other aspects that are

136
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,630
technologically induced that fit into

137
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,100
this which movement be information

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,360
security be business security if anyone

139
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,890
in here in a financial industry I'm not

140
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,900
going to ask this is what you're held to

141
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,729
this is basil this is what the

142
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,800
stakeholders and those high-level CEOs

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,150
are held to to make sure that they're

144
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,760
able to run their business this is what

145
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,590
the federal holds if you look at this

146
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,150
and dig large enough we could just take

147
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,280
the stock market the stock market's run

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,539
a lot by by using network time that time

149
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,529
base if it goes off just by seconds

150
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,329
changes the chance for someone to get

151
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,399
bids that can change an industry you can

152
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,159
change the world then you have an

153
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,989
understanding of fully how to deal with

154
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,309
all these pieces because if you brick we

155
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:02,389
come in we tell you you're all broken

156
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,339
and you don't do anything with it we've

157
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,679
wasted our time and we don't know what

158
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,079
your ruler is it's going to be dependent

159
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,789
on you and you have to have that risk

160
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,139
but I don't know what your risk is does

161
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,959
anyone think this is risky what about

162
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,409
this what about this guy here looks

163
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,689
really scared over here but he's got a

164
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,979
rope versus this guy or if you're really

165
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:33,199
daring who would want to do that I don't

166
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,579
know what your risk is I can tell you

167
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,069
one thing my background in life and limb

168
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,129
was totally different in time of war the

169
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,659
minimum the green was the people I would

170
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,279
worry about first I try to get people

171
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,439
back in there to fight in civilian world

172
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,109
it would be the immediate the Waldos in

173
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,489
black well unfortunately there was only

174
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:52,519
so much time we had this could be your

175
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,279
other risk just people throwing money or

176
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,389
for this gentleman who's in a lawn chair

177
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,029
flying over Iraq is that your risk I

178
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,669
don't know but before the war before we

179
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,809
come and tear you apart and you're not

180
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:06,139
ready and make a sad you have to be

181
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,669
ready the other thing I want to talk

182
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,849
about is you can all see a little bit

183
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,229
older I've been doing this for about 20

184
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,779
years I grow up in this time frame where

185
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,169
this was the cool technology nowadays we

186
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,179
can spend all day about to do this and

187
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:23,629
look like this all day I wonder what

188
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,659
sound he's making that's all I want to

189
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:31,189
know and as technology moves forward who

190
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:32,839
knows what's going to happen I don't

191
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,549
know if anyone's noted this but I'm also

192
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,610
kind of another side of geek it's kind

193
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,240
of cool so let's talk about a red team

194
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,519
person they're a little insane because

195
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,809
they also they have to know a lot of

196
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:45,800
things they have to know what your

197
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
business is they have to know the

198
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,149
technology which and the the adversary

199
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,370
in itself we'll talk a little bit about

200
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,040
the adversary part you need to know what

201
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,050
is that what's that motorists operandi

202
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,939
what exactly why they doing it what's

203
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,620
the cause it's that why this person's no

204
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,730
reason

205
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,550
is different from these reasons taking

206
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,839
it a little bit of psychology this is

207
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,850
Maslow's law it will not go across the

208
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,649
whole world but it does straight a thing

209
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,810
that here at the very bottom you have to

210
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,760
worry about your survival if you're in a

211
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,110
survival situation you're not going to

212
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,100
be worried about how pretty you look

213
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,089
you're going to be worried about getting

214
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,190
that food in those things as well as you

215
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,449
move up to this there are certain

216
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,040
triggers but as a human that you have to

217
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,180
do also back from the Cold War there was

218
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,010
a way to try to turn spies what they

219
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,240
used is they tried to figure out what

220
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,130
were those triggers and they put that as

221
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,350
mice so if you look down some of these

222
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,820
crimes it could be a combination of

223
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,899
these but if you look at it you have the

224
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,459
money you have that necessity back to

225
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,899
that survival what did you need to do

226
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,180
why did you rob that bank or why did you

227
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,589
rob that liquor store because of

228
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,750
whatever that causes the green could be

229
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,820
it it could be you decide to do criminal

230
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,589
college causes because you want to be

231
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,260
rich as well as vices it could be that

232
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,820
you have something you're trying to cope

233
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,220
with that you need that money same thing

234
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,829
in patriotic in the ideology this is

235
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:04,570
that want that feeling that that that

236
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,730
call to action we've got Patriots in

237
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,100
which we've seen enough on the CNN and

238
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,110
from either the uniform side or

239
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,569
religious cultures as well as we got

240
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,579
Julian Assange and the list goes on from

241
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,949
there and with the whistle blowing and

242
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,110
then we get into cohesion and when you

243
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,190
start talking about corrosion and

244
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,350
blackmail and particularly having an

245
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,870
inside red team that gets really scary

246
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,430
when you start talking about the

247
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,660
possibility someone coming and

248
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,970
kidnapping your kids in those areas it's

249
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,220
a hard conversation to have but it's

250
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,949
real and it's been going on forever ego

251
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,449
as well same thing it could be anything

252
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,579
from curiosity Morris worm how many

253
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:41,819
people are familiar with the Morris worm

254
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,279
okay 1986 the computer buter computer

255
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,899
abuse act was because of that Morris

256
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,180
worm was basically a curiosity to test

257
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,370
out this this worm that took down half

258
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,160
the internet at the time and you can map

259
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,079
those to those people what you're doing

260
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,949
is you're now getting an understanding

261
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,199
of why what exactly they're doing this

262
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,750
not just someone say I do the scope I

263
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,490
want to see if thumbs vulnerable what is

264
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,199
their intent did you piss them off on

265
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,420
the outside or is there something that

266
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,250
you're doing that they have that its

267
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,949
value then you take us a little bit

268
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:13,630
deeper you start looking at it and we'll

269
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,829
start at the top here we look at the

270
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:16,220
holistic time frame

271
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,680
to do a cross-site scripting may take

272
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,720
seconds but how long did it take you to

273
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,340
find that how long did it take you to

274
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,050
validate that to come up and craft that

275
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,210
whatever that exploit is that's a simple

276
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,320
one what if you want to do something

277
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,270
more of a Jack Bauer it takes that time

278
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,250
period to do that as well as is it

279
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,920
repeatable then you start getting into

280
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,540
finances and resources how much money

281
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,730
you have is there a particular element

282
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,980
or whatever is required to do that

283
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,230
attack that is not local in your area

284
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,910
you have to go procure that or someone

285
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,650
has to build it that takes that time

286
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,900
your skill sets you have to do a gap

287
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,820
analysis of yourself where you at now

288
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,850
what do you need to learn as well as

289
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,500
partnerships collaborations and levers

290
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,360
it goes back to that that partners if

291
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,950
you have more people joined into it it's

292
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,770
easier then you look at how they're now

293
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,030
they're actually doing it if you're

294
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,640
going to do China look at what their

295
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,140
paths are what are their what's their

296
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,950
regular pass to use their tools they use

297
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,910
then there's always the great debate

298
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,890
between the the pirates and a ninja but

299
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,780
really what it illustrates is do you

300
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,760
want to keep that money or do you want

301
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,230
to go to jail do you want to be covert

302
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,170
or overt and then how many adversaries

303
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,240
do you want once you figure that out

304
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,130
it's very dynamic so what you do is you

305
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,260
spend most of the time trying to figure

306
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,000
out what you've learned what's your

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,980
rules of engagement what you've seen

308
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,160
from oceans or what you've engaged from

309
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,290
what you've learned and you keep making

310
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,750
this decision over and over again it's

311
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,600
not simple it just keeps going and going

312
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,670
in addition every test you do you rinse

313
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,200
and repeat you do this scientific

314
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,830
methodology over and over that's just

315
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,690
the adversary side then we get to the

316
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,990
business we need to know what you do

317
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,540
what are your drivers what is key to

318
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,670
survival for you because that's the keys

319
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,950
of the kingdom we also need to what's

320
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,150
important what's the most important

321
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,800
what's least without having that we

322
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,750
could be hey here's a vulnerability or

323
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,160
here's exactly what we found as an

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
exploit it means nothing to them you

325
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,180
waste your time you also need to know

326
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,330
what's good or bad and their worst case

327
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,120
scenario what keeps them up at night

328
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,770
so now we talked a lot about it and some

329
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,360
of the things of if you're going to hire

330
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,860
here are some keys that you should you

331
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,660
want to do either if it's an external or

332
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,520
internal one you make sure that they

333
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,870
have clear objectives they know what

334
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,820
their scope is or not first of all it's

335
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,310
also very it can be very perceptive if

336
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,600
you do something you think you have the

337
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,430
right get-out-of-jail-free card and it's

338
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,170
interpreted the wrong way you could be

339
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,480
sitting in court so there's part of that

340
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,430
being played you also need to focus on

341
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,260
quality not quantity this isn't

342
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,580
something you just spit them out that's

343
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,500
what the scanning czar for pen testing

344
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,390
can be done as well depending on how

345
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,790
flexible you make it you need to accept

346
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,380
that challenge into criticism you need

347
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,320
to learn lauren and lower you also need

348
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,780
to synergize and partner having that

349
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,340
that report sitting somewhere is not

350
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,660
going to do anything you have to figure

351
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,220
out how to collaborate how to educate

352
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,560
and change that culture and then be

353
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,590
loyal to that red team having a lot of

354
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,850
sport for that red team will give you a

355
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,980
lot of value and have and give you some

356
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,230
intense stuff and for those fellow red

357
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,790
teamers right tool right skill right job

358
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,500
pay attention to detail remain humble

359
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,680
remain loyal that's key you have few if

360
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,120
you build a red team and they're not

361
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,130
ethical you're going to have a larger

362
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,990
risk you've induced the risk plan

363
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,120
rehearse rehearse synergize and then

364
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,690
give back to the community the other

365
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,180
thing I want to talk about is there are

366
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,590
number people talking about from the

367
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,630
artist perspective red and blue makes

368
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,970
the color purple it does but if you use

369
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,550
a term from the military it goes

370
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,800
actually back to this is the NSA and we

371
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
can use that word if you want or not but

372
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,070
this is really there OPSEC this is

373
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,990
operational security and this is

374
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,760
actually core to a lot of the criminals

375
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,290
who do get caught because they don't

376
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,570
look at certain things as I understand

377
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,860
it and I'm not an expert on the Silk

378
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,540
Road but he was caught because his

379
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,430
instant messenger closed while he was in

380
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,410
a store they could tell that that was

381
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,490
the person who closed this laptop

382
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,950
because he logged off and that was his

383
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,810
catch he didn't know who was around them

384
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,010
he didn't make sure he covered his

385
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,130
tracks that i think is it but i do think

386
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,589
the synergy is put important as well as

387
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,790
you've got to find that balance if you

388
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,470
tell too many secrets outside or you're

389
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,670
talking your friend and saying here's

390
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,930
the vulnerabilities who else is

391
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,020
listening and then you have a sad red

392
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,839
team does they I want to talk about is

393
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,339
semper Gumby it's once you have this

394
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,120
plan and all

395
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:44,040
changes so now going back to the war

396
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,250
games perspective we talked about this a

397
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,540
little bit does anyone want to play a

398
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,900
game because you all seem kind of tired

399
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,940
I've got the lucky of trying to wake you

400
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,200
back up and I hope this will illustrate

401
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,529
why red team is important but the first

402
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,060
thing I will say is I'm not going to say

403
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,839
who or what or bastardize anyone on this

404
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,660
this is an impact of it but right now

405
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,700
this particular story has so many

406
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,070
political stories I'm not diving into it

407
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,020
and everything I gathered here is only

408
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,270
from Intel that was on the line I don't

409
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,830
have any other information so today is

410
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,740

424
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,580
control well and this is a great

425
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,779
conference for the conference for this

these because this is important started

466
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,780
talking about terabytes into information

467
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,520
really right what's the biggest thing

468
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,100
and it says GOP d and this is important

469
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,090
in this case more data is going out yay

470
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,990
this is what you're seeing ask your

471
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,130
finance officers what they'll think

472
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,550
about that ask regulatory is what

473
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,680
they're going to feel about that yes

474
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,240
continues and a DAT to add salt to

475
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,510
injury here's your global security

476
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,280
guidelines of exactly what to do and all

477
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,450
the people who've took training and

478
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,250
their addresses and their passwords

479
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,370
again you're starting to feel more and

480
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,940
more like this and then screenshots like

481
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,870
this go up online again what you can do

482
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,230
pretty much with your network is this

483
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,820
now wait you start getting more emails

484
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,180
and this is why I think it changed if

485
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,720
you look this is all sony but right here

486
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,220
they started going after something that

487
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,700
changed they went after your family and

488
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,410
when you do that you play with hearts

489
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,070
and minds we all have certain things we

490
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,010
were we talked about earlier we had a

491
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,480
conversation about social engineering

492
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,540
and the emotions but when you feel like

493
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,550
this what does your team do there's

494
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,500
nothing else you can do in addition for

495
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,150
those hackers out there who or those who

496
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,670
like to keep their privacy their network

497
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,340
which takes a lot of work for them to go

498
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,680
through hotels to avoid paparazzi and

499
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,610
all fanboys have all been destroyed

500
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,380
because it was there do you think they

501
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,560
want to work with them what about their

502
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,530
employees here's copies of it with their

503
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,690
signatures going back to more cascading

504
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,940
ideals here's the here's their contracts

505
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,300
that were cascaded out of it pretty much

506
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,130
everybody else is pissed off at you as

507
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,710
well this is only a few days in

508
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,750
continuing on still GOP d they're

509
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,490
talking about the FBI they start to get

510
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,410
a little brazen those areas to give you

511
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,600
a second to read through that but

512
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,640
there's still about more of so many

513
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,800
employees besides that one of the family

514
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,090
and they started talking about terrorism

515
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,210
so it's starting to escalate this to me

516
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,660
kind of throw a wrench in a question

517
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,100
these people showed up and they wanted

518
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,170
something totally different now for me

519
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,450
and you could just take movies or what

520
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,450
any other story you

521
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,640
why would you change your motive halfway

522
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,770
through and why would you add complexity

523
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,600
of this going on and I'm not going to

524
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,890
discuss these people which was a

525
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,390
different attack and if it was

526
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,440
coordinated would make it even more

527
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,330
interesting but this was occurring at

528
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,940
the same time continuing down the streak

529
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,690
Laura comes in they get a Christmas gift

530
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,470
or potential christmas gift it never

531
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,860
actually came and then again getting

532
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,500
more into the hearts and minds as you

533
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,000
read through this the world of fear

534
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,580
starting to call out 911 as well as

535
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,200
saying if you live near these houses you

536
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,420
should move this isn't a normal thing

537
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,100
nor am i saying everybody's this is this

538
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,390
isn't the fear uncertainty and doubt

539
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,950
this is just really what happened this

540
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,540
is a good war game story if you were

541
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,440
going to tell a story to your CEO or

542
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,790
financial officer there are impact their

543
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,520
impacts in here that they can see so

544
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,110
what did that happen well all their

545
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,330
contractors all the people to push out

546
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,390
your product said you know what hell no

547
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,710
hell no what did that force your

548
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:47,440
business to do this they had to figure

549
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,060
out a new way to push everything they've

550
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,030
done and they had to stop because of

551
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,990
life and limb injury which is weird

552
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,830
because I don't think I've ever would

553
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,330
have said life and limb and Technology

554
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,270
together but this builds into at least

555
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:07,360
that impact that threshold so there's

556
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,460
tons of Sony impacts I'll talk about a

557
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,910
few of them just to give you an idea

558
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,710
this is called attrition warfare this is

559
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,180
basically stopping someone from being

560
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,790
able to work this is basic sunzu type

561
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,260
stuff and I don't know if you can read

562
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,810
that but that's how many servers three

563
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,570
thousand computers and 800 servers is

564
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,910
that a good day in addition while the

565
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,170
ax-cut well the attacks were still

566
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,020
occurring there sony employees were

567
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,610
suing them fast forward a few more you a

568
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,480
few months you know what's still coming

569
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,009
now we're starting to talk into the

570
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,049
cascading effects and indirect effects

571
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:49,909
that most people have a challenge to

572
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,950
talk about because it's hard to say

573
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,629
we've tried the stock options and or

574
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:55,370
stock and set all the stock is going to

575
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,249
go down once in a while it does but it's

576
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,409
not really a good metric but the legal

577
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:02,749
fines and a simple fact that one that

578
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,159
all these are still sitting out there

579
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,120
now continuing I I know you can find

580
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,370
Seth Rogen's email I mean but has he

581
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,139
changed it how many other people that

582
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:13,820
are not so many employees have changed

583
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,529
there's one of their information is out

584
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,210
there what other attacks that have

585
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,740
occurred so if we do the adult friend

586
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,480
finder is there Sony attack people in

587
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,279
there could you use that to blackmail

588
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,749
someone at a later date I don't know in

589
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,879
addition it's also started to hit gender

590
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:30,769
and right now in day and age of female

591
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,399
equality and as equality is everything

592
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:37,070
else this is impactful this will weigh

593
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,320
or sway your money makers your big-time

594
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,009
people in addition so much I have I live

595
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:44,749
with my wife and my 17 year old daughter

596
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,279
they read more of this it wouldn't

597
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,289
influence me but I'm sure someone reads

598
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,549
this magazine and this makes their

599
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:52,809
decisions of how they look at the world

600
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,369
what about all those people watching

601
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,220
soap operas it's just ironic this year

602
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,240
happened to be there 50 year anniversary

603
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,399
spend all that time advertising and

604
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,799
doing this for a number of years and

605
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,019
potentially could had that cancel change

606
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,490
your customers the people you care about

607
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,450
and unfortunately this lady here the

608
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,889
whole most worst picture they could ever

609
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:14,779
find ever and I feel really bad for her

610
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,669
at this time I can't condone what she

611
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:18,529
did if you haven't heard about this she

612
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:19,700
sent a nice little email to a friend

613
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,279
about this person which is really bad

614
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:27,529
but look where she SAT before this

615
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:30,379
incident this is Forbes she was one of

616
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:31,999
the 100 most powerful women she's been

617
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,749
dropped ask your CEO if they wanted to

618
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,960
be on Forbes I bet they'd care this

619
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,519
person here total different incident but

620
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,169
he feels horrible to this actually

621
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:44,869
happened to be a CEO who his company

622
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:47,749
happen to have some type of foodborne

623
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,049
pathogen this is him in court not sure

624
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,970
why this person still there that's a

625
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,470
whole other thing of male and female and

626
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,509
I'm not here to say whether you believe

627
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:57,059
Sony

628
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,570
real or not it is a Black Swan event i

629
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,220
will guarantee and if you don't know

630
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,720
what a Black Swan it's that one off it's

631
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,700
the rarity it's like a 911 it could

632
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,179
happen when it happens it's really bad

633
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:11,840
but what if one of these attacks what if

634
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,879
just the malware occurred or your doc

635
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,919
seen this is coordinated that's what I

636
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,690
think also makes us more interesting is

637
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,279
it wasn't just one attack vector it was

638
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,240
coordinated to add to the complexity

639
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,980
this was only a few months ago this was

640
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,070
on 60 minutes this is the old view of

641
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,379
what a cyber hacker was as well as this

642
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:39,539
and this God actually this is more the

643
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,279
truth and there's another interesting

644
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,190
factor in psychology so basically what

645
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,600
this is is this represents what's called

646
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,639
the hundredth monkey in Japan there

647
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,200
happen to be a bunch of scientists who

648
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,159
are working with these particular

649
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,379
species of monkeys and they would feed

650
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,179
them sweet potatoes they look they

651
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,980
learned that the older monkeys would

652
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,600
just eat the potatoes with the sand on

653
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,279
it but a few younger ones would actually

654
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,919
wash it off they watch this culture for

655
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,080
a while and a document what happened is

656
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,840
they learned that as they started to

657
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,470
grow up into the numbers up to a hundred

658
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,539
monkeys more people start to accept it

659
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:16,860
what they hit that pinnacle point that

660
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,749
tipping point not only did they change

661
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:20,669
here they changed across the other

662
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:23,100
islands without interaction which was

663
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,080
interesting so if you put a hundred

664
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,600
bunkies a bunch of monkeys together

665
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
eventually you'll get some kind of

666
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,129
intelligent design so what it's

667
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:33,990
illustrating is once people learn how to

668
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,659
do stuff will go back to will use

669
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,389
skating Tony Hawk has set set mines and

670
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:41,519
it set the perspective of Mines for

671
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,769
people to do amazing things when I

672
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:45,509
started skateboarding it was just flake

673
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:47,999
flat board and that was it it just

674
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,379
changed your mind once you see something

675
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:51,809
happen to changes it but the other thing

676
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,399
that's also added to it is tools are

677
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,499
getting easier anyone know what this is

678
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:59,850
I do not know what this is if you don't

679
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,499
this was part of the anonymous movement

680
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:02,730
what this basically gate is gave

681
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,259
everybody including your grandmother's

682
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:06,169
the ability to do a denial of service

683
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:09,169
yeah

684
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,539
and we can use that point but I bet when

685
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,390
most Linux people started here youtube

686
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,669
and google was not the most easiest way

687
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:52,529
to learn how to do things now it's easy

688
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,570
but that's very good point I didn't get

689
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,669
into that deep part but the ease of use

690
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,169
is there is what I'm illustrated well

691
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,510
also illustrating is original if you

692
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,220
went back the cost for this ransomware

693
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:10,919
was up now it's free now it's free which

694
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,440
makes it a little hard again three

695
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,919
anyone get internet but thank you for

696
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,450
the information so the question is

697
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,200
really going back to what would you do I

698
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,270
don't know you now understand the

699
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,559
differences between vulnerability

700
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,570
scanning pen testing and red teaming you

701
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,090
can take this term if you want or not

702
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,649
all I can tell you when you're trying to

703
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,419
explain this to people it's already

704
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,370
convoluted you add more to it not get

705
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,809
clarity it makes your job even more

706
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,580
challenging and this job is very much

707
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,980
partnerships so when you hire the man to

708
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,390
do the full rampage and destroy

709
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,740
everything remember it's going to hurt

710
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,090
but it's the lesson you get out of that

711
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,929
that you that you receive and the

712
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:53,490
collaboration you put together across

713
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,610
these attacks with this different view

714
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,950
and a holistic thing that will save you

715
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,350
from being this this is a lot faster

716
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,820
than I thought for 200 slides but get

717
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,260
out there or if you're a business person

718
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,630
get out there there's a number of great

719
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,179
sites on there on red team in itself

720
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,039
some of them come from the physical size

721
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,809
exclusively some come from the

722
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,149
electronic side some bring the human you

723
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,760
need to have that holistic view be

724
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,070
completely flexible and thank you thank

725
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,870
you also for b-sides and for sale for

726
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,620
having you here
