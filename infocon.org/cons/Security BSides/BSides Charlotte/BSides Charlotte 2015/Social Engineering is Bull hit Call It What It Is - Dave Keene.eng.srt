in it so we'll try that alright thanks I

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,340
am surfer Dave we have a group called

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,869
Charlotte hackers anonymous I thought I

7
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:31,700
just plugged that real quick it's kind

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,410
of our new group we get together on

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,180
Saturdays and hack and drink and stuff

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,930
like that so anyone that's interested

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,219
you're welcome to come we have actually

12
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:41,570
a little table out there that's horribly

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,870
staffed and no swag because we're we

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,769
don't have any money so so anyway social

15
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:52,339
engineering is something that I do for

16
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,079
work and I'm not going to say that I

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,199
don't not a social engineer the idea

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,600
behind it those is a misnomer is for in

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,019
my opinion so that this talk came about

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,210
before Carolina con the CFP was closing

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,030
and there wasn't enough speaker so one

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,060
night after working with a very

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,080
prominent social engineer in the

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,650
technology field I had a few Bourbons

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,850
because I was a little upset about

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,650
things and came up with this talk and

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,510
then forgot what I came up with and

28
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,770
actually had to email them back after

29
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,800
they accepted so this kind of forced me

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,630
to get out of my comfort zone and do

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,740
some research that I've been wanting to

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,790
do so the standard disclaimer is these

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,400
are my views and opinions obviously i do

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,700
work as a red team ER for a large

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,000
international bank in the charlotte area

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,620
so obviously those are not their

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,110
opinions they're mine and much like the

38
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,850
title of this talk citations are needed

39
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,660
but i do provide a slide deck at the end

40
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,370
or slide at the end with some of the

41
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,540
books that i use for reference so just

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,880
warning you now so this talk might

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,800
contain some of the following things it

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,870
might have triggers like this is a

45
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,620
trigger this is the

46
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,080
humuhumunukunukuapua'a it's the Hawaiian

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,900
state triggerfish there might be kittens

48
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,970
there might be Chuck Norris there you

49
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,500
know the usual stuff that ends up in

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,710
security talks a lot of times

51
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,920
and of course at and most besides

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,780
there's alcohol involved at some point

53
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,950
of the day so if you hear anyone mention

54
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,970
anything about advanced persistent

55
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,490
threats or any of the thing with a

56
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,520
c-word or someone telling you that as

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,700
hackers the world is going to end if we

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,490
don't protect it no it's not the world

59
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,770
went on for eons before hackers showed

60
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,690
up on the planet so anyone talking about

61
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,240
fear uncertainty and doubt really take a

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,340
drink or make them take a drink actually

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,930
so a little bit about me I thought who

64
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,250
introduced me but me at 14 years old

65
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,840
we're going to see if this audio works

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,820
because we're kind of I'll so I'll have

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,640
to hold up to the microphone that's

68
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,630
water guys though

69
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,520
you guys hear that we're recording

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,000
alright so we were actually building

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,310
things from the Anarchist Cookbook in

72
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,570
the basement and thought it was smart to

73
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,930
put it on video a 9 site the internet

74
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,000
didn't work that back then now it's on

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,910
the internet so FBI please just remember

76
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,890
that was when I was 14 sacchi

77
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,280
limitations has run out so let's get

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,080
let's get started let's let's kick this

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,120
off let's talk understand a little bit

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,280
more about why I kind of want a rail on

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:21,010
social engineering so what's social

82
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:35,190
engineering social engineer all right so

83
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,660
basically I the way we use social

84
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,150
engineering in the media and as people

85
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,560
and we're not the only ones that use

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,150
social engineering and everyday speech

87
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,770
its kind of like polar vortex was a

88
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,350
thing I really would like us to move

89
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,360
away from it so we're going to go

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,190
through a few things we're going to

91
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,110
define what social engineering is we're

92
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,960
going to look at really what it is some

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,640
history behind it and then some

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,810
techniques that work from a sociology

95
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,480
perspective now this isn't a technical

96
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,950
talk i'm going to be dropping zero days

97
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,240
and things like that but this is more

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,250
about the human element involved in

99
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,800
information security and just being

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,350
humans and really how we relate to each

101
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,560
other

102
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,750
so let's break it down let's talk about

103
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,520
with what the word social and engineer

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,460
mean so social is an adjective it

105
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,360
describes somebody means it's relating

106
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,190
to it activity spending time with each

107
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,560
other doing enjoyable things together so

108
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,690
they lock Phil guys are out there right

109
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,370
now we get together quite I'm not

110
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,240
completed with those guys we get

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,130
together once a month at a bar and pick

112
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,479
locks and drink beers and things like

113
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,490
that same thing we do with Charlotte

114
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,289
hackers anonymous same thing we're doing

115
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,819
right here right now something we do

116
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,509
together it's a social gathering we

117
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,020
would like to be with and talk to people

118
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,900
now this one's for us as a group at

119
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,789
least for me and some of my friends

120
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,680
relating to people or society in general

121
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,770
doesn't really work I don't know about

122
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,440
you but as the big guy in school I was

123
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,470
picked on because I was one playing D&D

124
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,819
at the lunch table instead of like

125
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,050
hanging out with the jocks and stuff

126
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,870
like that but so sometimes we don't

127
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,539
necessarily relate to being social

128
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,960
butterflies now an engineer is a person

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,090
who has scientific training who builds

130
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,440
all these awesome things that's brought

131
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,680
us in the 21st century now this is a

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,620
female engineer she's working on a power

133
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,830
plant and by far this is the hardest

134
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,509
picture to find on the internet ever

135
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,820
because the internet doesn't think that

136
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,130
engineers can be women or if they are

137
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,479
they have to be in like some kind of

138
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,020
skimpy costume but she definitely you

139
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,409
know it can be either gender it's also a

140
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,659
definition of a person who is in charge

141
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,349
of a ship or airplane or so these guys

142
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:01,580
or a guy that runs a train like that guy

143
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,520
an engineering as a whole is the

144
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,590
professional art of applying these

145
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,590
things these knowledge is it's at the

146
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,060
bottom there it says a special knowledge

147
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,580
is associated preparation for

148
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,380
professional practice involves extensive

149
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,849
training and application of that

150
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,340
knowledge now do we think that the word

151
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,610
social and engineer really work here I

152
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,830
think not personally engineer kind of

153
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,050
like a my title at work I have engineer

154
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,340
in

155
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,139
title but I don't have a degree in

156
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,639
engineering I don't even have a degree

157
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,860
so why am I called an engineer these

158
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,210
people went to school for years and

159
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,520
years and years but yet they're called

160
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,030
engineers social engineers so I think we

161
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,440
really need to break it down and call it

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,500
what it is we're not social engineers we

163
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,110
are manipulators and we're we use

164
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,820
manipulation and deception to help

165
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,460
protect our environments so how do we do

166
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,600
this in information security well we use

167
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,889
fishing to test people's response to

168
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,780
possible phishing attacks that are very

169
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,270
real threat on the internet phone calls

170
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,479
also known as fishing we're calling up

171
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,710
and trying to solicit information

172
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,810
password social security numbers and so

173
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,510
forth dumpster diving you're looking for

174
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,940
information about businesses and people

175
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,550
to use that information to leverage

176
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,400
against them daxing where we find

177
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,770
information that is available on people

178
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,840
to use against them and then open source

179
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,299
intelligence and this slides kind of

180
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,219
small I apologize but this is a tool

181
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,380
called multi go mal t go will pull

182
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,440
information from multiple different

183
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,940
sources on the internet to find out more

184
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,440
about people and you'd be surprised what

185
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,720
people put out there that leads to

186
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,520
making using for manipulation so if

187
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,170
you're on Facebook and Twitter and all

188
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,779
these different things if it's on the

189
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,060
internet it never dies so just keep that

190
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,100
in mind and and using tools like this

191
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,560
make it very easy to plan targeted

192
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,330
attacks against people through

193
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,190
manipulation okay let's switch gears now

194
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,870
and talk about the history of

195
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,339
manipulation and deception why these

196
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,550
things work why is it possible why as

197
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,980
humans do we allow ourselves to get

198
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,410
deceived and manipulated well the first

199
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,820
story arguably the first recorded story

200
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,810
during creation in the Bible was the

201
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,089
first thing that happened involving

202
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,480
humans was deception so just to recap

203
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
that story real quick God is puts Adam

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,180
and Eve in a garden of eden and he said

205
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,700
they cannot heat this from fruit of this

206
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,120
tree they can eat for everything else

207
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,800
Satan he's checking this thing out and

208
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,230
he's like wait they serve him I want

209
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,310
some of this attention i'm going to go

210
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,950
down and heat and then satan turn

211
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,980
himself into snake he deceived Eve and

212
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,060
the interesting thing is that Eve

213
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,000
actually went and took it back and use

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,820
deception on Adam Adam never saw the

215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,830
snake never talked to him so that

216
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,620
deception was actually passed down so

217
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,260
arguably that's the first written

218
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,640
history of deception in ancient times

219
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,850
false waits was a big problem still to

220
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,340
this day it happens but people in

221
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,630
marketplaces would think that we bind

222
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,070
like a unit of grain it might be

223
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,720
actually half of unit because the

224
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,100
weights would be falsified so they

225
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,320
actually in Roman times enacted tax

226
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,020
collectors to go and check the weights

227
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,430
that people are using not to defraud the

228
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,860
people we still do this today if you go

229
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,270
to a gas pump you'll see a sticker on

230
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,100
the gas pump that says it at this

231
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,480
certain date somebody checked to make

232
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,280
sure that the measurement of gas from

233
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,100
this gas pump is accurate and it still

234
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,780
happens today in other countries yes you

235
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,580
will get deceived out of gas just FYI

236
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,040
and from experience clothing makeup and

237
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,620
smells the things that we hardly think

238
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,130
of as being deceptive but archaeological

239
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,110
evidence shows about 70,000 years ago

240
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,210
our ancestors started adorning their

241
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,280
bodies with ochre a reddish powder that

242
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,140
purposely was used to manipulate men

243
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,340
into thinking they were ovulating and

244
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,260
obviously procreation is a big thing

245
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,800
otherwise the humans would die off so

246
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,630
this this thing these techniques were

247
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,420
used ancient Egyptian women would use

248
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,460
different pace and things to make their

249
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,140
eyes big they would use paint to color

250
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,320
their lips and Greek and Roman ladies

251
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,420
would die their heads their hair blond

252
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,700
they use makeup and lighten their skin

253
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,800
and remove unwanted body hair sounds

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,510
familiar it happened back then it's

255
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,709
still happening now

256
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,060
nothing wrong with it it's just

257
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,220
something that's happened it started off

258
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,399
as something to continue the

259
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,730
appropriated process of the human race

260
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,380
so that deception all these things are

261
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,660
ingrained in us so as kids were told at

262
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,319
a young age and and this is to me when I

263
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,509
read this in during my research is

264
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,250
really at home for me they were house

265
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,630
supposed to be polite we'll just have a

266
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,120
manner not supposed to point out to

267
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,220
somebody if they are acting rudely or

268
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,630
inappropriately like this guy here you

269
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,579
probably just crossed the hall I'll

270
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:25,899
never say anything to him because he's

271
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,889
acting out of not normally for people in

272
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,440
society so we're taught to do these

273
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,180
things but what are we doing we're

274
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,420
actually not telling the truth we're

275
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,889
thinking ourselves that's disgusting

276
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,329
what's wrong with that guy must be like

277
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:43,389
from some you know backwater town he's

278
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,130
never known these things but we're

279
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,130
really teaching art we were taught to be

280
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,810
polite the politeness is actually a type

281
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,279
of perception because they're not

282
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,410
speaking our truth speaking away we

283
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,680
think

284
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,230
now the origins of Santa Claus and

285
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,999
Easter and the Easter Bunny and those

286
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,249
types of things our deception and we

287
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:08,499
continue to propagate to our children so

288
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:12,009
Santa Claus actually came from Germanic

289
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,170
people the this is a picture of the

290
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,929
Norse god Odin and at ye olde Tom Odin

291
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,399
leads a great hunting party through the

292
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,490
sky celebrations so this kind of leads

293
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,869
to comparisons with Santa is reindeer

294
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,790
there's actually there's other HD ities

295
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,519
and rode across the sky and chariots

296
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,259
drawn by goats and gave presents to

297
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,639
children at the end of the year and

298
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,649
that's kind of fed into that legend as

299
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,949
well this is Easter OST or stara is a

300
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:47,389
dramatic timidity that was the one of

301
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:49,910
radiant dawn the uprising of light and

302
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,290
it's that's why Easter happens around

303
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,209
the same time every year it's the spring

304
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,600
equinox and this was celebrated every

305
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,519
year in her honor the Easter Bunny and

306
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,529
rabbits and chickens and things like

307
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,540
that these things reproduce really

308
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,170
quickly you have these animals as a sign

309
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,959
of procreation as a celebration of

310
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,480
fertility so all of these customs and

311
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,129
things like that don't have origins and

312
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,319
Christianity they don't have origins in

313
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:22,429
the Bible they are they were woven in to

314
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:27,410
help make the people more likely to not

315
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,329
rebel against the government's that

316
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:33,998
we're taking away those pagan traditions

317
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,750
okay we're going to look at some of the

318
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,880
techniques that that really work when it

319
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,620
comes to manipulation and deception and

320
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,120
and how because as humans we follow

321
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,410
these techniques in our day-to-day life

322
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,240
so this an awareness of them really good

323
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
help help us identify them and also use

324
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,640
them for for testing our own

325
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,980
environments so the rule of reciprocity

326
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,190
or ruler reciprocation it's basically

327
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,230
the Golden Rule do unto others as you

328
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,750
would have them do unto you now the Hare

329
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,770
Krishnas found an excellent way to

330
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,430
exploit this the hairy Christmas would

331
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,500
be worship being in public and they

332
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,840
would walk up to a person and they just

333
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,580
hand that person to flower and to stand

334
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,940
back and obviously with someone hands

335
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,380
you something for free you don't

336
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,870
understand why they say well I don't

337
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,670
want this flowering the Hare Krishnas no

338
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,200
that's yours it's a gift from the hairy

339
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,270
Krishna but if you'd like to make a

340
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,490
small donation to our cause we'd be

341
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,550
willing to take it so the rule of

342
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,230
reciprocity and what we're used to doing

343
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,350
you don't receive free you know it's

344
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,300
usually reciprocating so someone gives

345
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,470
you something you give them something in

346
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,390
return so those worked really well for

347
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,510
many many years from the seventies into

348
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,900
the 80s now a days most of our sinaa

349
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,370
chol about doing things like that we've

350
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,900
heard about these types of things and

351
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,330
how they work so it's not as effective

352
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,140
as it was previously but the next

353
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,090
example it's still and this is a legit

354
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,480
reason why the rule of reciprocation

355
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,620
works so I was in New Orleans for

356
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,360
conference one time went to Jackson

357
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,830
Square is watching these guys doing some

358
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,300
breakdance because I like that kind of

359
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,890
stuff but this any kind of street

360
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,380
performers I notice the way that they

361
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,540
were getting donations for what they

362
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,190
were doing they actually had one guy

363
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,140
that had the money but another guy in

364
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,360
the crew right next to him would be the

365
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,860
first one it would dropped by five or

366
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,830
six one-dollar bills into the bucket now

367
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,040
everyone sees that and they walk around

368
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
one is donating so you know we saw

369
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,660
something cool in that that's perfectly

370
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,370
fine because I enjoyed their performance

371
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,019
give them a couple bucks I want them to

372
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,209
keep doing it so that that is actually

373
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,370
reciprocation that works correctly now

374
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,110
this example when I was doing my

375
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,560
research I came across i recalled

376
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,019
something that I used to do when I lived

377
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,169
in New York I used to take people when

378
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,819
they come to visit all around town New

379
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,010
York we'd go on the subway but we take

380
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,990
them all over the place there's this

381
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,079
olive bar up in the upper west side and

382
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,000
a cool thing about this olive bar and in

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,099
New York City it's unheard of is you

384
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,990
could have as many olives as you wanted

385
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,549
while you're in the store like 50

386
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,470
different types of Olives as much as you

387
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,609
want it there's no one standing around

388
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,770
watching years no one like Costco

389
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,940
hovering around giving you free samples

390
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,230
so we would you know spend some time in

391
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,720
there but inevitably every single person

392
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,160
that took up there nine out of ten times

393
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,710
they would buy olives and these are

394
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,120
people that flew in or staying at a

395
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,580
hotel and no refrigeration and we're

396
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,530
taking the subway and walking all over

397
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,110
the city why would these stupid olives I

398
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,480
don't know how I says I don't know why I

399
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,250
didn't think of it before but they the

400
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,490
rule of reciprocation says that you know

401
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,870
they went in there next sample these

402
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,970
olives it's not because the olives are

403
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,470
super good it's because they were

404
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,690
pressured into doing anything they

405
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,600
thought well you know subconsciously hey

406
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,250
I i bought some of these all right i

407
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,480
sampled some of these olives might as

408
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,630
well buy some so it worked really well

409
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,679
in that case and the next story can't

410
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,900
tell this I might just skip because it's

411
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,730
if you want to hear this story about Las

412
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,920
Vegas come talk to you later I don't

413
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,750
want to offend anybody if there are here

414
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,210
that in this story actually one of them

415
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,060
is in the story in larkfield okay anyway

416
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,180
we'll just bypass that for now it's a

417
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,730
good story I just don't want to always

418
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,520
look at that another technique that

419
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,600
works is commitment and consistency

420
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,980
racetrack betters when they go to the

421
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,630
racetrack they look at the the track

422
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,450
record the odds of the horse and they're

423
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,570
not you know usually not to decided when

424
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,280
they go in there as to who they're going

425
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,580
to pin once they pick that horse and put

426
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,130
that money down on that horse now they

427
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,980
stand by that horse you see people

428
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,840
cheering they're cheering for that horse

429
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,550
that they put the money on but why

430
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,050
because they committed to that course

431
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,480
and if they started cheering for another

432
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,430
horse or booing the horse that they

433
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,690
already picked their up staying

434
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,280
consistent that commitment another way

435
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,380
to illustrate you straight this is that

436
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,210
of abuse spouses I wanted I don't want

437
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,090
to downplay this isn't a joke this is an

438
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,100
actual service message from Australia so

439
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,390
it doesn't matter what gender there's

440
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,360
abuse on each side I'll give you example

441
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,840
of commitment and consistency here you

442
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,890
have men and woman they're living

443
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,580
together the man's an alcoholic drunk he

444
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,930
doesn't do much he's not interested in

445
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,330
getting married the woman wants him to

446
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,010
stop drinking and they want to eat what

447
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,260
she wants to get married but what

448
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,200
happens things keep going on he doesn't

449
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
want to change she wants some change she

450
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,340
finally says I'm done with this I'm out

451
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,710
of here so she leaves she finds someone

452
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,460
else falls in love with that person they

453
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,980
get engaged because it's what you really

454
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,429
want

455
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:07,669
to do what happens the first guy first

456
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,249
guys says well he comes up to ghost

457
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:12,320
ghost to her and says you know what I've

458
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
changed I went to rehab I stopped

459
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,029
drinking I bought a ring we can get

460
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,919
engaged and married you know in six

461
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,350
months if you come back to me ultimately

462
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,840
she really wanted to be with this guy so

463
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,369
what does she do she breaks off the

464
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:29,360
relationship with him with her through

465
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,710
fee on current feelings that goes back

466
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,509
to live with this guy this is all

467
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,309
theoretical this is all this story that

468
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,210
was in one of the books about commitment

469
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,480
and consistency I don't want to use real

470
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,009
life examples when talking about this

471
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,129
but so she goes back to him and what

472
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,559
happens after a few weeks he starts

473
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,690
drinking again she mentions when are we

474
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,389
gonna get married well I don't know I

475
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:56,659
kind of changed my mind on that what

476
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:00,649
happens now she is even more committed

477
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:04,399
to him than she was before because she

478
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,600
was getting married to another person

479
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,549
and she had to defend herself she had to

480
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,139
tell her family hey I'm with this guy

481
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,850
I'll never this guy was an [ __ ] I'm

482
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,490
not gonna go back and Jim ever well now

483
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,320
she's convinced people that he's not

484
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,210
that bad and I'm going back but she's

485
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,460
now she's committed to him to him again

486
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,340
now she has to stay consistent to that

487
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,519
commitment so it's kind of reinforced

488
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,480
that commitment and she has to defend

489
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,470
the way that she thought

490
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,140
another way commitment commitment and

491
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,820
consistency works us during Christmas

492
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,160
time during the Christmas the toy

493
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,440
companies were saying well we queue for

494
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,630
us is amazing we're selling all these

495
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,910
toys are selling all this stuff he one

496
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
comes around and nobody's buying toys so

497
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,980
how do we fix this problem well if

498
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,080
you've ever gone through the console

499
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,080
wars in the 80s nintendo and sega and

500
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,790
all those things you know that trying to

501
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,170
get one of those things around christmas

502
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,170
time was damn near possible but as soon

503
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,060
as the first quarter roll around you can

504
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,570
get one why did why is that toy comely

505
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,720
figured out that if they push the

506
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,570
product really hard all the kids would

507
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,360
want that product and so the parent says

508
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
the kids like yes dad this is all i want

509
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,110
for christmas I don't care about

510
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,960
anything else that says of course some

511
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,610
that's only thing I promise I'll get

512
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,580
that for you what happens that present

513
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,330
is not available for him to get so he

514
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,680
buys a whole bunch of other stuff for

515
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,530
the kid just say as a nice Christmas

516
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,720
comes around next year but he's promised

517
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,890
that he was going to get this thing now

518
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,780
he goes back to the store spending the

519
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,100
exact same amount of money he already

520
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
spent to buy what the kid really wanted

521
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,620
because we have to be consistent in

522
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,710
training our children right otherwise

523
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,540
you know they don't have that that up

524
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,380
bring that we didn't grain with since

525
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,630
human time so parents want to show

526
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,140
children consistency and the toy

527
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,730
companies have taken advantage of that

528
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,330
as well so now we're going to move on to

529
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,250
NLP and I've already talked to somebody

530
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,770
today and they said LLP is a bunch of

531
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,760
crap but that's fine everything it's a

532
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
way of identifying certain things at

533
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,230
least in that I've been able to identify

534
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,000
certain things to get inside someone's

535
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
head and the whole idea that I use it

536
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,560
for is to actually gain rapport with the

537
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,270
person so we're going to go through a

538
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,770
few few neuro-linguistic programming

539
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,390
techniques you'll see this a lot in

540
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,940
movie shows and things like that but

541
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,710
things that you can pick up on about a

542
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,920
person that really can kind of aid in

543
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,870
your understanding more about who they

544
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,200
are and how they're feeling at that time

545
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,700
so pacing and matching is the first one

546
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,590
is similar method acting and Johnny Depp

547
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,170
says here that if you don't if you're

548
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,780
part part if you're acting if you don't

549
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,540
put some of yourself in that acting that

550
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,580
character it's not acting it's just

551
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,140
lying so that's true you're trying to

552
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,650
match your you're trying to match

553
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,750
another person's body language basically

554
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,820
in their speech in order to build a poor

555
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,500
it rapport is the most important part of

556
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,570
Norland Wisty programming because once

557
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,970
we gain that once we close that gap and

558
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,710
able to talk to somebody then we're

559
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,960
better able to manipulate them or find

560
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,900
out information about them so this

561
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,790
method actor you can see by the

562
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,160
different expressions on his face you

563
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,290
can discern a lot about what he might be

564
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,510
feeling at that time if you saw a real

565
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,880
person with those expressions you

566
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,140
naturally you can have to see when

567
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,700
someone's upset or someone's happy or

568
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,889
someone's

569
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:46,539
drunk or whatever so you can tell a lot

570
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:50,970
about a person by their fingers so

571
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,139
pacing and matching is not mirroring

572
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:55,480
itself it's integrating parts of their

573
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,629
personality into yourself so this girl

574
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:01,389
here you can tell when speaking with her

575
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,669
you can tell by her parents somewhat but

576
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,049
you could tell when speaking with her

577
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,539
that she's probably from the country she

578
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,789
probably won't understand a lot of big

579
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:11,919
fancy words they come from like New York

580
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,110
City or things like that she might not

581
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,369
be able to relate to those things

582
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:18,220
whereas this person doesn't speak any

583
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,960
kind of language that makes any sense at

584
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,609
all so speaking to her speaking of her

585
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,139
you'd have to bring yourself in line as

586
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:28,539
well and use vocabulary that she would

587
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,629
not find it inappropriate to hurt the

588
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:35,379
way said she speaks however that is yeah

589
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:40,450
we'll just leave that alone mirroring is

590
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,669
another NLP technique there's three

591
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:44,200
different types of mirroring behavioral

592
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,369
mirroring it mirrors things that I have

593
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,070
a symbolic meaning and just an example

594
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,070
of this a lot of men might not realize

595
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,409
this but when we speak to women our

596
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:58,989
pitch goes up a little bit because we're

597
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:00,940
matching that person's tone and makes it

598
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,749
a little bit more disarming we do that

599
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:07,809
naturally a lot of men do because it is

600
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,179
something that we've learned as an

601
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,570
instinct to keep the human race going to

602
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,220
match somebody else to make them more

603
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,269
comfortable symbolic mirroring there's

604
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:20,590
there's a couple different ways the

605
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,700
symbolic narrowing works one's wardrobe

606
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,369
i lived in austin texas and i work for

607
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,890
the local governments association there

608
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,530
so as all the old commissioners judges

609
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,810
all these guys from all these very rural

610
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,170
counties and then all were Stetson hats

611
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,510
and boots and wrangler jeans and things

612
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,350
like that I walk in like this how do you

613
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,440
think I get received not as well as

614
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,970
another person from Texas so I said

615
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,500
what's the O'Neill I'm changing my

616
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,890
personality to move to Texas but after a

617
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,900
while I thought well let me try this out

618
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,350
and see how I'm received sure enough got

619
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,810
a hat got some boots but not that

620
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,060
uncomfortable I thought they would be it

621
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,100
started dressing more like them now I'm

622
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,340
seen as being one of them now I'm

623
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,770
welcomed into the boys club that is

624
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,660
Texas and I never thought I never owned

625
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,910
a gun before I went to Texas now i know

626
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,100
many guns and i joined I'm you know so

627
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,860
it works both ways if you actually

628
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,160
become and start mirroring someone long

629
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,250
enough parts of their personality and

630
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,380
their ways of thinking will actually rub

631
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:42,200
off on you writing is another way of

632
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,480
doing somaliland symbolic nearing an

633
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,850
example what of this would be for a

634
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,850
liberal person writing to conservatives

635
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,080
what type of language would be most

636
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,670
effective liberal language or

637
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,710
conservative language so there is a

638
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,930
paper that was written in the late 70s

639
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,350
about Cuba and Fidel Castro but it was a

640
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,840
liberal trying to express his message to

641
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,060
conservatives so he wrote in a

642
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,980
conservative language if you think about

643
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,750
we all have different sets of language

644
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,460
that we use with each other like our

645
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,350
security language of dropped in sight

646
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,350
metasploit or popping boxes and dropping

647
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,270
shells and things like that we talked to

648
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,710
normal people they have no clue what any

649
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,560
of that means that's our language so he

650
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,240
used conservative language language that

651
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,890
they're comfortable with and normally

652
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,410
are used to reading and writing this

653
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,810
article what happened all the Liberals

654
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,570
went crazy because they're like what is

655
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,170
this liberal writer writing

656
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,750
as a conservative the language there

657
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,360
that he used to mirror that mirror the

658
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,700
Conservatives was more powerful than the

659
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,930
message itself exchanged matches it's

660
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,390
not mirroring exactly it's a trade off

661
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,990
so say you're trying to understand how a

662
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,970
person's feeling or trying to calm them

663
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,040
down with their breathing you can notice

664
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,050
how how their breathing and actually

665
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,740
match it with with your arms moving back

666
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,570
and forth and things like that so your

667
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,010
training off different things that

668
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,330
they're doing so if they have their hand

669
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,860
on their face like this you might give

670
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,290
you this you know something here so

671
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,360
you're not nearing them exactly but

672
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,710
you're exchanging one part of the body

673
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,960
for another what happens is you both

674
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,690
fall into a rhythm because of you

675
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,520
matching their their body language now I

676
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,610
give you an example of how this works so

677
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,070
the guys get super pissed off or very

678
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,740
frustrated and like you know he's going

679
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,280
to explode any second what do you do a

680
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,150
man just calm down calm down this is an

681
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,640
exchange match you're trying you're

682
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,380
using your hands and trying to bring his

683
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,390
his level down trying to bring his

684
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,310
breath down so we all done exchange

685
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,230
matching we didn't make maybe didn't

686
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,210
even realize that we were doing a type

687
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,520
of mirroring to help someone bring

688
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,570
someone back down building at

689
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,160
maintaining before it is showing

690
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,830
interest in another person is not just

691
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,440
the the only way it's it's a positive

692
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,700
connection between you and another

693
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,340
person or group so it's not just showing

694
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,870
interest it's something that really has

695
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,420
to be taught you really have to learn so

696
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,060
being someone that might not be a

697
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,510
socially like a social butterfly

698
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,740
something that we have to practice us

699
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,480
manipulation professionals not on what I

700
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,370
call in any new terms will just keep

701
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,400
keeping all random but sensory acuity is

702
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,660
the ability to recognize about something

703
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,490
about a person's disposition and it

704
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,220
helps to close that gap so in this

705
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,750
particular instance what do you think

706
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,840
would happen if this shy guy at a party

707
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,630
if those two girls behind him went up

708
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,870
talk to him it probably would end up

709
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,580
being pretty bad he probably run off and

710
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,590
hide or something like that personal

711
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,860
experience I I know that's what I did

712
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,420
feel I got over that but what if this

713
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,670
guy shows up anyone's to talk to him as

714
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,260
well very flamboyant outspoken how do

715
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,330
you approach to talk to that shy person

716
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,340
well you don't you don't become these

717
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,800
people you become more like him you look

718
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,650
at me shy you go and more model mannered

719
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,460
and and your posturing and things like

720
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,900
that will more replicate what he's

721
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,240
feeling how he's doing things to gain

722
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,250
the report I mean who knows that looks

723
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,420
like probably the guy that has all the

724
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,310
passwords to the network that's the guy

725
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,390
you're going to go and want to be

726
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:43,430
friends with so once you start picking

727
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,400
up on some of these things you can

728
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,900
understand more about how a person's

729
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,260
feelings so this guy you can tell he's

730
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,590
obviously had a hard day he's stressed

731
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,050
out a little bit so understanding that

732
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,550
becoming sympathetic to him you can

733
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,800
actually close that gap with him as well

734
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,340
speech is a great indicator as well some

735
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,780
people say that a pause or delay might

736
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,560
indicate someone being deceptive but i

737
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,670
can ask Matthew what were you doing

738
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,850
seven years ago today right you don't

739
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,860
know yeah you have to think about it but

740
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,530
I ask you seven years ago today did you

741
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,179
rob a gas station maybe

742
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,040
alright

743
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,620
of course I picked on the guy that's

744
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,110
going to be cynical but anyhow so

745
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,640
generally speaking that person's iono

746
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,960
robbed a gas station if they are you

747
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,100
might be hanging out with like the wrong

748
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,340
people you know but but so you can you

749
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,500
can tell just apologizing necessarily

750
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,140
mean deception so you have to kind of

751
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,830
way those circumstances they come up dry

752
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,080
mouth can show anxiety on the stress

753
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,480
level the voice can show what the

754
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,540
person's thinking or what how the person

755
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:09,010
is reacting to what you say the accent

756
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,480
also not only could tell them where

757
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,340
they're from and also their educational

758
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,720
level or go back to these two and if you

759
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,130
notice when speaking with them that then

760
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,740
I'll use a big university level words

761
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,950
that it's more like a high school level

762
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,680
or in Snooki's case whatever planet

763
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,800
she's from whatever level there you can

764
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,840
tell more about their education for

765
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,340
example i live in Bessemer City which is

766
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,580
outside of gastonia and when I go to

767
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,590
local establishments there I don't use

768
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,410
big fancy heavy-duty university level

769
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,410
words because they'd look at me and they

770
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,290
think I'm being a pompous ass they're a

771
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,330
lot of it's a working-class town a lot

772
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,070
of you haven't been through much more

773
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,570
than high school if they even made that

774
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,310
far and that's fun there's nothing wrong

775
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,290
with how people live their life but

776
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,530
understanding their accent and their

777
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,750
vocabulary level allows me to adapt so

778
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,000
that I don't offend somebody once again

779
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,080
we're talking about building that

780
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,000
rapport there the best way to piss

781
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,650
someone off is to talk about their head

782
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,820
body language you can look at body

783
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,270
language for clues about how to proceed

784
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,129
so stress levels are pretty

785
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,359
instantaneous we have that

786
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,449
fight-or-flight response that really can

787
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,429
can tell that that switches on

788
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,369
automatically that we all have as

789
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,649
instinct so we can tell a lot about a

790
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,609
person's face facial expressions tension

791
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:37,949
rigid body language language so on

792
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,690
although I think this guy's face is

793
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,230
permanently stuck like that now here is

794
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,609
a good example like what are they seeing

795
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:47,820
off off you know off camber you know

796
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,940
Barack looks a little disgusted and

797
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,668
Michelle looks surprised as you can tell

798
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:55,560
that there's something happening off

799
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,760
camera that wasn't expected no Lance

800
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,430
Armstrong we are familiar with his drug

801
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:10,369
use and coming and being banned from

802
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,570
from the sport but this interview

803
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,050
happened at South by Southwest before

804
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,270
any official allegations come out and

805
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,530
you'll notice he's doing something

806
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,319
called shielding okay a great indicator

807
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:24,089
for persons not telling the truth is

808
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,599
that they instinctively will cover parts

809
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,730
of their bucket their face or dark their

810
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:35,160
eyes or look away so as to not directly

811
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,109
tell you that lie so that's a great

812
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:39,630
indicator someone's being deceptive if

813
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,770
you're if you're speaking with them

814
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,460
and then there's this guy um but you can

815
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,800
tell that there's something wrong here

816
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,800
this is an extreme example but pupil

817
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,630
dilation thinning of lips is a real

818
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,160
thing and something each you can

819
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,740
actually look for and dropping in some

820
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,920
information see you drop in some

821
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,310
information on somebody that they might

822
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,040
be uncomfortable with is it's a great

823
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,360
indicator once you're going to flight or

824
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,850
fight response kicks in and the body

825
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,680
automatically makes these changes

826
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,490
calibration is using sensory acuity to

827
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,410
gauge the state of persons in and once

828
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,180
you understand the statement that person

829
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,830
then you're able to cultivate that state

830
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,440
in yourself so for example this this

831
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,990
actor here he uses various techniques to

832
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,120
kind of an method acting so that he can

833
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,760
become different people depending on the

834
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,230
role she's in so say you came up to

835
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,480
somebody that looks very upset and you

836
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,640
want to calm them down do you become

837
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
very upset so that you can calm them

838
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,880
down or do you become the opposite of

839
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,030
that so this is this calibration is

840
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,630
gauging how the other person's feeling

841
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,720
and then making yourself turning

842
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,170
yourself into what would change that

843
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,000
situation maybe you do really want that

844
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,790
guy to get more pissed off I know a

845
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,220
particular person that I encounter with

846
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,480
and that's all I wanted to do is get him

847
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,060
even more out of them so I got in his

848
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,610
face and ended that so it depends on the

849
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,770
situation how you calibrate yourself to

850
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,530
the other person body language can tell

851
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,250
you a lot the posture now in this little

852
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,670
and this look if he changes his posture

853
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,750
and the stance in a sitting position

854
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,060
quite rapidly and every frame is it

855
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,980
tells a different story so you could

856
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,480
tell a lot about a person by their

857
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,870
posture and whether or not you can adapt

858
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,790
that posture for yourself so if someone

859
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,010
standing rigidly and straight up you

860
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,420
could present yourself like that if

861
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,220
someone's being casual you can tell a

862
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,160
lot about

863
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,000
how a person's feeling that way

864
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,579
gesturing how fast or how slow often

865
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,309
open and closed will tell you how to

866
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,950
approach that person so if you're used

867
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,780
to working with somebody that speaks for

868
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,210
their hands a lot it's very normal to

869
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,410
come and speak with your hands a lot

870
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,240
i'll allow you to build that rapport

871
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,470
without them even knowing that that's

872
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,660
what you're doing but you don't want to

873
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,400
be open and things like that with

874
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
somebody that is like this or doesn't

875
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,710
feel like having a conversation very

876
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:22,859
closed now breathing is harder to master

877
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,390
and there is scientific evidence of this

878
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,859
because there's an entire field of

879
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:34,000
hypnosis that uses breathing to to put

880
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,730
someone in a hypnotic state but what

881
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,130
this does I instead of trying to match

882
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,319
breathing and things like that when I

883
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,240
used breathing techniques I notice a

884
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,000
person as they're breathing they're

885
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,260
going to have to take a breath in and a

886
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,119
breath out and usually you speak on the

887
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,970
way out so you match your breathing and

888
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,529
try and find out when you can interject

889
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:57,390
into the conversation so you match your

890
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,160
rhythm with theirs so that you can bring

891
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,549
your point across as well so just a

892
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:08,680
quick wrap-up of everything's what we

893
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,779
think about social engineering in my

894
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:13,119
opinion needs to change when you start

895
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,220
looking more at the human element I know

896
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,920
its technical folks we like to be y'all

897
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,039
hacker and all that cool stuff and gain

898
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,319
gucky pop shells and get people to click

899
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,779
on stuff but really we're trying to

900
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:28,180
secure the human not necessarily just

901
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,059
the technical so we can use these these

902
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,829
things in all aspects of our life we

903
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,260
help our family our friends understand

904
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,960
that these people that are performing

905
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,210
these manipulation techniques really

906
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,549
help them identify these things so that

907
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,349
they can protect themselves and we can

908
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,630
take some of this information back to

909
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,130
our companies and help protect our

910
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,349
companies as well anyone have any

911
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:56,770
questions do you use these as part of

912
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,809
your actual day job

913
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,729
so the question is do I use these things

914
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:10,829
in my day job yes I do to an extent one

915
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:15,359
time on a red team member and part of

916
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,130
our mission our Charter is to test our

917
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,140
security controls so whether or not our

918
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,819
social engineering awareness program

919
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:27,989
works so I might use a phishing email

920
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:30,960
that cheap someone click on blank but

921
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,869
for me personally I'm more effective

922
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,049
over telephone when I you know I'm not

923
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,430
just waiting for someone to click on

924
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,349
something I actually like to call and

925
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,720
engage somebody it's easier the phone as

926
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,819
well than in person because you're more

927
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,319
comfortable because you can't see what

928
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,059
that person's reaction you use more of

929
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,119
it to detect from their tone of voice

930
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,609
and and how they're responding how that

931
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,470
you can proceed and how you can better

932
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,890
get information from them that answer

933
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,200
your question because in a quick follow

934
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,570
you don't mind

935
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,090
happen what percentage of cases would

936
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:10,160
you say leads to uncovering of a gap in

937
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,090
the education of your corporate users in

938
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,580
other words how often does someone

939
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,980
develops

940
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,960
how often is someone divulge information

941
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,770
um where I previously was with another

942
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,440
large bank I was getting around seventy

943
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,600
percent where I'm at now i'm ninety-five

944
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,460
percent and it's it's a it's a change

945
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,320
for an entire organization to really

946
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,210
understand those things because a lot of

947
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,810
these trainings get it buried down in

948
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,369
emails and things like that i do another

949
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:43,770
presentation on building your awareness

950
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,980
program at the Charlotte is a summit a

951
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,859
few weeks ago but what happens is you

952
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,020
have emails that get sent out for

953
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,570
awareness training but they are part of

954
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,790
another huge email newsletter so they

955
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,740
get lost or it's not mandatory training

956
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,780
or something like that or people are

957
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,460
able to next X finish and click through

958
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,490
it really quickly but you know you offer

959
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,980
someone a free dinner or some tickets to

960
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,050
a sports game generally speaking people

961
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,990
will give you more information so you

962
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,690
make it enticing for them and basically

963
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,200
you're feeding on what they're saying or

964
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,990
what they're doing in order to give you

965
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,369
no respond so you end up with a lot of

966
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:24,990
people especially if you're targeting

967
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,820
it's very difficult to stop the targeted

968
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,380
manipulation attack I mean how its

969
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,200
social engineering but that's what we

970
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,830
call it as a turn but and ironically I

971
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,380
think John's got something for me to

972
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,609
give away but is there any other

973
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:44,090
question

974
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,200
state-by-state different states regulate

975
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,589
the use

976
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:08,040
the question is states by States and if

977
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,430
I heard of anything I honestly I haven't

978
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,640
I would love to find that out because

979
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,630
there's a lot of people that are called

980
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,480
engineers I'd like to throw that law

981
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,470
North Carolina does have statutes in

982
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,420
terms of the professional use of the

983
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,750
term engineer I know the case in the

984
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,380
early 90s guy was charged he was in New

985
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,150
York State for calling himself a

986
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,860
tortured engineer for doing some

987
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:42,330
unpopular research and so it's

988
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,400
interesting the rise of the term social

989
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,550
engineer

990
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:53,860
I would love for that to happen I love

991
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,450
for that to happen because I've been a

992
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,060
Microsoft systems engineer since from 15

993
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,120
16 years now come on it's a piece of

994
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,680
paper that says I passed the test it's

995
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,930
not an engineer degree I know a lot of

996
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,230
Engineers i went for years and years as

997
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,870
much as you know doc doctors and things

998
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,720
like that i go to school to get that

999
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,580
engineer title for us to throw it around

1000
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,280
like you know it's kind of you know I

1001
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,990
just don't like anyone's big pet peeve

1002
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:33,040
of mine yes so what are you so 95%

1003
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,900
impact rate what I do for follow-up so

1004
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,330
in doing so I take a multi-tiered

1005
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,760
approach so we start off so if I'm doing

1006
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,080
running out of fishing campaign start

1007
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,630
off with a level one fish is very

1008
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,930
plainly obvious that it's a fish so if

1009
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,670
they click on that link they're going to

1010
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,200
have to go back for additional training

1011
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,250
in remediation if they report that link

1012
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,780
then they go to level two level T is a

1013
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,520
little harder the spelling isn't you

1014
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,560
know better it's not coming from Nigeria

1015
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,080
up to where everything looks legit

1016
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,140
except for you know the link is actually

1017
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,910
going to the wrong place you teach

1018
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,980
people to think if it's not something

1019
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,690
that they're used to seeing so that

1020
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,070
multi-tiered approach kind of helps

1021
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,870
graduate people up and make it more

1022
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,600
difficult more secure unfortunately

1023
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,050
getting buy-in for a major organization

1024
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,300
to to do that type of training is very

1025
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,290
difficult it's still unsuccessful where

1026
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,590
I'm at now but we're working on it so

1027
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,700
smaller organization I think might be

1028
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,110
able easy to remediate if you can go

1029
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,420
talk to the person but with you know

1030
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,820
hundreds of thousands of people

1031
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,970
programs makes it difficult yes

1032
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,460
so the question is using only ASCII text

1033
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:21,270
and email and and then to only what you

1034
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,020
can say on the over the phone one ASCII

1035
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,180
text I would never be able to do that

1036
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,810
because marketing every marketing groups

1037
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,150
maybe Brad everything and they stick

1038
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,510
links on everything there's no way that

1039
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,750
they would let that happen and two I

1040
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,300
think there are things that you're

1041
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,860
supposed to give out but once again it's

1042
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,090
one of those things that sits on the

1043
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,460
side of the computer desk and if it

1044
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,470
sounds like you're legit from tech

1045
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,300
support no one does any kind of

1046
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,610
authentication there because I

1047
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,650
especially if you say if you mess with

1048
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,720
someone's computer remotely and then you

1049
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,690
call as your tech support like say if I

1050
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,730
said a phishing email they click on a

1051
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,170
link that does something malicious on

1052
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,970
their computer and now I follow up with

1053
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,860
a tech support call it's going to sound

1054
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,540
legit because I've actually targeted

1055
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,490
that person when after so if people

1056
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,500
would use that that'd be great but it's

1057
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,040
like this disaster preparedness Flyers

1058
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,320
that get some workplaces you put it up

1059
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,020
so you know exactly the procedure if

1060
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,480
this happens then you do this well if

1061
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,070
you don't read it and it just sits there

1062
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,680
forever it gets forgotten about so

1063
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,960
unfortunately there are scripts in fact

1064
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,390
in the computer a lot of these will love

1065
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,630
screen pop with the customer information

1066
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,090
which spoofing and I caller Ids pretty

1067
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,610
easy to do call it customer information

1068
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,500
and they have a script on what they're

1069
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,270
supposed to say and a lot of times you

1070
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,490
can get them diverted off of that script

1071
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,118
yes

1072
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:07,610
um

1073
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,620
the question is is there a specific age

1074
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,020
group that is more susceptible to social

1075
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,540
engineering actually I don't think I've

1076
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,690
done any kind of analysis over that that

1077
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,200
would be interesting i would say

1078
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,620
Millennials and you know Gen Xers

1079
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,060
through Millennials would be more

1080
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,400
susceptible because we are what they

1081
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,650
term digital natives we grew up around

1082
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,390
this stuff we're used to seeing it we're

1083
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,340
used to putting stuff and and tweeting

1084
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,460
things as they've been developed I would

1085
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,620
say that they more susceptible because I

1086
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,450
know some of the boomers in our company

1087
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,910
I mean they still you know mess up

1088
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,210
emails and things like that so that

1089
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,040
would be an interesting analysis but

1090
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,140
that's just my opinion off the top of my

1091
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,700
head any more questions I think we got

1092
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,120
like a time for running one more now

1093
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:05,720
okay cool where's that uh I can do it or

1094
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,970
you can do it that's all I do it okay
