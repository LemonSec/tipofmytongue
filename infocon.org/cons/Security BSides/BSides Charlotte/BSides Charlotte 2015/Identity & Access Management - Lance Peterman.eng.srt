1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,420
just to kind of dove tail on that a

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:13,950
little bit

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,870
I just came back from a national

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,980
conference where for the first time ever

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,900
I got to speak at the national level and

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,640
besides being scared witless you know

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,320
one of the things that the the host of

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
the conference said at the very end in

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,020
similar vein is a lot of people have a

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,399
story to tell and if you think you want

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,950
to tell a story don't be afraid to if

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,770
you're looking to people to encourage

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,160
you to you know submit a proposal and do

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,980
those things do it this community in

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,570
particular has been super supportive of

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,960
me doing it and you know I will

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,690
certainly offer my willingness to

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,820
encourage anybody who thinks they have

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,520
something to say and and want to get up

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,890
on the stage and do it because everybody

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,600
has great ideas just the the

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,820
conversation that took place towards the

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,770
end of the last presentation was

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,600
indicative of that so a lot of people

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,460
have some great ideas so I would say if

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,610
you're thinking about it jump in you

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,079
never know what will happen and usually

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,639
you'll walk away the pretty great

29
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:27,569
experience so we're going to talk about

30
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,569
identity and access management and I'll

31
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,039
very briefly kind of give you my safe

32
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:35,759
harbor slide background I've been in and

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,499
around identity management for about the

34
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,569
last 22 years that of course didn't call

35
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,990
it that back then that that's really

36
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,609
kind of a modern creation of about the

37
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,310
last 10 years currently I work in I am

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,749
former King company I were a lot of

39
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,959
different hats I'm also a volunteer high

40
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,359
school speech and debate coach that does

41
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,219
not come with any warranty or guarantees

42
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,969
as to my performance today you know

43
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,799
hopefully my students might see this

44
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,569
video and go oh hey the old man actually

45
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,799
knows what he's talking about but we'll

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,380
see how that goes but more most

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,060
importantly the opinions expressed here

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,410
even though I do work for Mark are my

49
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,240
own so in case it's not obvious from the

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,700
previous picture I have two passions in

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,520
life one obviously is digital identity

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,599
that's why I'm up here talking to you

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,599
guys the other is my horses and it's

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,450
pretty rare that those world

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,730
intersect but within the last month I

56
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,180
had what can only be best described as a

57
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,260
self-inflicted teachable moment related

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,640
to my horses that I think is

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,500
particularly instructive for today's

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,930
discussion my wife and I live in

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,330
Charlotte and we are blessed to have a

62
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,140
very small horse farm and periodically

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,780
we let our horses graze on our very

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,190
small pastures we can't let them out

65
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,540
there full time because they would have

66
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,360
her graze it quickly so when we do that

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,980
the horses have to pass through a series

68
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,260
of gates in order you know very much

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,150
like in the enterprise in order to

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,900
access their data I mean grass and in

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,790
that process obviously we're doing so to

72
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,019
make sure that they don't wind up in

73
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,959
places they aren't supposed to be so one

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,819
day last month I did not securely lock

75
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,879
one of the gates and the littlest one

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,129
there got out and like most reaches I

77
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,610
was not the one to find this out my

78
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,370
neighbors were and that followed by a

79
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,010
phone call to my wife followed with a

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,660
phone call to me and let me tell you

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,760
that is not a conversation I would wish

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,170
on anybody the good news is we were able

83
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,849
to get pony back she's safe and sound

84
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,019
yes her name is actually pony however I

85
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,420
have nicknamed her Dropbox now because

86
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,560
dlp is kind of a little weird but so

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,639
what does all this have to do with

88
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,139
digital identity management well

89
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,019
connecting the dots a little bit in

90
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,489
particular with identity management but

91
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,169
it's in some respects true security in

92
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,680
general identity as only as good as the

93
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,530
people processes and the tooling that

94
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,720
you use in order to secure your

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,269
enterprise and any one of those legs

96
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,899
fails in my case locking the gate and

97
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,490
you can have a breach or horse running

98
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,930
around and so what we'll talk about in

99
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,270
the identity management world is you

100
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,680
know trying to engage in these programs

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,479
is usually very complex so I'm going to

102
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,640
try and unpack it a little bit this is

103
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,870
going to be a little bit of a general

104
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,969
talk but I'm going to go through a lot

105
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:39,720
of the different air

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,730
riaz or disciplines within identity

107
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,250
management and I deliberately have

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,130
crafted this to allow for deviations or

109
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,050
deeper dive so if there's particular

110
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,510
areas that you're interested in by all

111
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,030
means please speak up so what we'll do

112
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,440
is initially is kind of unpack what

113
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,530
identity management is and then we'll

114
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,760
talk a little bit about some of the most

115
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
recent breaches but it's going to be

116
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,540
done specifically with respect to the

117
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,980
identity layer and then you know we'll

118
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,320
also talk about the types of identity

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,090
management programs you can engage in

120
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,740
we'll talk about some of the latest

121
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,920
developments and identity there is help

122
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,950
on the way and then finally we'll talk

123
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,600
about you know some of the adoption

124
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,950
approaches you can take what are those

125
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,170
keys to success and then I'll finally

126
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,000
talk about a note on security versus

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,770
opportunity so why identity hopefully

128
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,840
most people recognize this because it's

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,090
classic identity confrontation you're

130
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,470
getting challenged by three questions

131
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,280
before you can cross this bridge the

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,320
reason why identity and part of this was

133
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,330
alluded to in the previous talk although

134
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,410
not directly and that's one of the

135
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,960
reasons why I enjoyed the previous

136
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,970
presentation so much as you're looking

137
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,500
at where your threats are and the

138
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,940
business doesn't always understand what

139
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,010
those threats are and one of the areas

140
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,220
of threat without question is identity

141
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,930
and I'll talk specifically with that

142
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,350
with respect to the breaches does this

143
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,660
look familiar and I don't mean that

144
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,090
specific site this was actually at a

145
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,280
conference that I attended and you know

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,710
it it's I've invented an acronym for

147
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,630
this I have no idea if it's unique but

148
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,030
it's yaller and it's yet another log in

149
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,360
or registration and that's one of the

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,550
things that is probably our biggest

151
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,150
challenge in the identity world and you

152
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,710
guys all feel this how many of you just

153
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,800
curious use password managers probably

154
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,100
good share hands I checked my one

155
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,110
password account the other day and I'm

156
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,620
up to about 250 for logins some of those

157
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,210
work you know good chunk of those are

158
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,640
work but not all of them and that's

159
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,160
probably not even all inclusive but that

160
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,750
gives you an idea the scope of what

161
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,160
we're dealing with is you know

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,200
simplifying this world is a huge

163
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,130
Challenge one of the arguments that has

164
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,990
come up i would say in the past three

165
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,270
years it was actually invented by a

166
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,950
gentleman from General Electric named

167
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,260
Dan hedrick who at the time it was a

168
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,090
very good idea that it was a concept

169
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,040
that you know with the expansion of

170
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,900
where everything is moving not just in

171
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,660
the enterprise but in the world you know

172
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,190
identity is really your new perimeter

173
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,650
for controlling access to things and

174
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,110
there is some soundness to that but my

175
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,210
argument is you can't talk about things

176
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,860
anymore in terms of parameters the

177
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,930
perimeter is gone the idea of the old

178
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,580
days where you have the castle and the

179
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,040
moat and you have that solid perimeter

180
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
of detection you can control who gets in

181
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,450
and who doesn't get in is gone you've

182
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,400
got users that are accessing or

183
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,230
demanding access to data from any device

184
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,100
at any time in any place using a variety

185
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,040
of means so the picture on the right is

186
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,900
a little closer to that the good news is

187
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,700
there is a control out there that can

188
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,650
assist you in that effort and obviously

189
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,480
you know reason I'm up here is I think

190
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,260
identity is one of them so now we're

191
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,220
going to talk about a few breaches and I

192
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,980
actually updated this yesterday because

193
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,420
of some recent news that came out

194
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,630
actually on Friday that just made my

195
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,590
blood boil this was not the one but I'm

196
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,030
going to start with the IRS breach

197
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,160
everybody pretty much familiar with what

198
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,040
happened there for the most part IRS

199
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,960
decided to launch a user friendly

200
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,550
service that would allow you to get your

201
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,120
tax records concept it's a great idea

202
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,490
the problem was they were using

203
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,380
knowledge-based authentication in order

204
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,640
to initially enroll the user and

205
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,059
unfortunately they were using

206
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,549
information that was pretty easy to

207
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,280
social engineer or even just simply

208
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,340
search for on google in order to find a

209
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,570
person you could set up a trial account

210
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,760
on ancestry.com and probably find out a

211
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,720
lot of the things you need to do what

212
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,660
that resulted in was roughly about a

213
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,960
hundred thousand taxpayers had their not

214
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,030
their identities compromised but really

215
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,230
the set the stage for identity

216
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,800
compromised I just refinance my house so

217
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,040
I paid particular attention

218
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,570
to this but paying it you know looking

219
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,380
at the full detail of my 1040 you have a

220
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,779
lot of information that can be used to

221
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,430
steal someone's identity and that's

222
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,899
ultimately what these guys are facing

223
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,459
and some of the other breaches they're

224
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,690
facing even worse ironically when this

225
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,300
feature came out I was one of the first

226
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,000
people I being an identity geek I'm

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,920
wanting to go kick the tires and see

228
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,690
what the IRS is doing or more

229
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,880
importantly not doing right and so I

230
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,860
created an account that was ironically

231
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,120
the easiest way to protect yourself

232
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,949
because you already had the identity

233
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,350
created so the hackers couldn't come in

234
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,329
and create that identity now could they

235
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,720
compromise my identity sure but that

236
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,459
process is a little trickier than just

237
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,190
simply using some basic knowledge so

238
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,209
obviously that's a huge challenge for

239
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,860
the hundred thousand people that were

240
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,660
impacted by this and I would argue that

241
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,089
that number is even higher because those

242
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,339
are the filings which often times or

243
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:04,480
joint returns if you happen to be

244
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
married so it's more than 100,000

245
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,690
taxpayers and obviously anthem has

246
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,970
already been mentioned but i want to lay

247
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,160
this one with the identity context as

248
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,199
well actually i want to back up just one

249
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,329
second with respect to the

250
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,310
knowledge-based authentication i don't

251
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,810
know how many of you have experience

252
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,930
with that but oftentimes when you're

253
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,449
applying for credit or you're applying

254
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:34,029
for particularly sensitive credentials

255
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,500
they will try and use knowledge-based

256
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,880
authentication it's stuff that you

257
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,730
should know an easy example of that is

258
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,110
they may send you a list of addresses

259
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,880
and they'll say which one of these did

260
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,490
you live on and they may not even have a

261
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,990
valid address in there and of course the

262
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,430
answer is none of the above that's the

263
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,110
type of things that they can do that is

264
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,319
an inherently brittle way of

265
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,370
authenticating users unfortunately it

266
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,870
has to be used sometimes in the digital

267
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,819
world because you don't know who that

268
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,529
person is at registration time and that

269
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,360
was the challenge that the IRS faced was

270
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,310
we want to roll out this great service

271
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,170
to allow your average taxpayer to get

272
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,779
their return and be able to print out

273
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,220
those records especially when they get

274
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,120
audited right and unfortunately they

275
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,290
failed because of the brittle nature

276
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,699
that so they they had to pull the

277
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,620
service offline so when you are looking

278
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,840
at using knowledge-based authentication

279
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,430
especially within your enterprise pay

280
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,840
attention to how those services

281
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,150
implement that we use a service that I

282
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,550
won't name because I don't try and focus

283
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,240
on vendors in this space but they're kba

284
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,910
questions are terrible I mean any of the

285
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,130
ones that are canned pre can't kba

286
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,640
questions are often terrible there are

287
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,750
things you don't want to answer like

288
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,940
where were you born you know that that's

289
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,280
not hard to find out from somebody if

290
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,770
you're trying to hack their account so

291
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,250
if you can avoid kba please do but if

292
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,350
you're forced to do it allow the user to

293
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,000
create their own questions because

294
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
oftentimes they can come up with that

295
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
the challenge with that is the user has

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,070
to remember even the answer to those

297
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,930
questions and I actually had a colleague

298
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,470
true story just joined the company and

299
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,960
my job was to train him and one of the

300
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,400
first things I told them I said you know

301
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,260
go to our password management site

302
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,930
because what's the number one reason for

303
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,170
people calling the helpdesk password

304
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,180
reset or password changes or my counts

305
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,880
locked out whatever it is passwords so I

306
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,740
said first thing do go to the site do

307
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,170
your thing two days go by I have another

308
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,550
session with them and I say well did you

309
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,070
set up your profile he says no he says I

310
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,510
can never remember the answer to those

311
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,920
questions so I just didn't bother to

312
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,680
fill it out if an information security

313
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,320
guy won't fill out that program how are

314
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,060
you going to expect regular users to do

315
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,010
it that's the challenge we run into so

316
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,520
now let's talk about anthem it's now

317
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,620
being called officially the largest PII

318
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,410
breach in history not just US history

319
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,070
but history 78 million users or insured

320
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,920
records or put the math to that one in

321
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,530
four Americans insured adult Americans i

322
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,810
should say that's a staggering number

323
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,590
and the good news was the actual medical

324
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,780
records i don't believe were part of

325
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,250
that breach to the medical history at

326
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,200
least according to anthems official what

327
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,990
happened statement they didn't get the

328
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,670
actual medical history on the user's

329
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,990
which is particularly sensitive data but

330
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,090
it's still obviously staggering in terms

331
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,140
of the impact and that's why so many

332
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,400
people are able to raise their hand

333
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,660
somebody even commented that they got a

334
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,870
letter from anthem how did they get in

335
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,040
and then this is where we start talking

336
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,710
about i denti

337
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,940
first of all they fished into the front

338
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,250
door real simple they tricked somebody

339
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,300
using and this was particularly clever

340
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,820
they used a dupe of the Wellstone calm

341
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,130
website instead of the 2 l's and

342
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,710
wellstone they put numbers so even if

343
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,450
the user was trying to be but you know

344
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,810
somewhat you know prudent and looking at

345
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,910
the Earl going to that website if you're

346
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,530
not paying super close attention or if

347
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,900
you have my eyes you might mint you

348
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,490
might miss the fact that that's going to

349
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,930
a site with two ones in the number

350
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,230
instead of 2 l's anyway it asked them to

351
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,000
provide their credentials in order to

352
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,380
get into the site so that's how they

353
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,990
kind of got in the front door once they

354
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,820
got in and I'll talk about this a little

355
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,300
bit more later but classic you know kill

356
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,180
chain methodology they're looking to

357
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,860
escalate privilege you know because

358
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,150
there's a good chance the insured that

359
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,400
they just got in with or you know the

360
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,780
user they just got in with that system

361
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,850
may not necessarily have the type of

362
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,380
access that they want to do to execute

363
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,120
the breach they're looking for something

364
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,430
to elevate access compromise of

365
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,930
credentials is the number one way in

366
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,240
which that happens the good news in this

367
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,300
scenario a and I don't think it gets

368
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,530
enough attention in response to this

369
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,090
particular breach and I think part of it

370
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,850
was because of the size of it anthem

371
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,920
started sharing their threat

372
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,990
intelligence with other healthcare

373
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,170
companies and this is something that for

374
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,400
a long time companies have been

375
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,320
unwilling to do and I'll be honest it's

376
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,720
true even in the pharmaceutical sector

377
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,650
as well because we're you know a whirl

378
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,050
rivals we may be collaborating on

379
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,760
different types of drugs and whatnot but

380
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,890
we tightly control what they get access

381
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,310
to and so even the threat intelligence

382
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,450
might be information that might cause

383
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,100
one guy to get breached and not the

384
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,570
other guy and you think oh well that's a

385
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,160
competitive advantage well we finally

386
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,810
gotten past that stage and say look

387
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,540
we're all in this together so the

388
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,940
group's high trust and nhi sac which are

389
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,640
both health care-related security

390
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,580
organizations have worked with these

391
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,380
various members of that organization to

392
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,390
start pooling and sharing the threat

393
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,570
intelligence and to me that's an

394
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,550
important milestone because that begins

395
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,080
to

396
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,550
it's not going to level the playing

397
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,530
field but it least gives companies a

398
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,450
good heads up on what's coming and this

399
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,670
was the big update to my slide deck from

400
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,300
yesterday I'm sure some of you guys are

401
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,340
familiar with what happened with the

402
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,330
office of personnel management but as a

403
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,880
US taxpayer and I suspect all of you in

404
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,770
this room or probably taxpayers in some

405
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,970
form this was just staggering now I'll

406
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,210
be the first one to admit this is not

407
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,400
full in terms of we don't have the

408
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,170
forensics yet to understand how much of

409
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,180
an identity layer there is on top of

410
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,530
this but I do want to talk about a

411
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,920
couple of pieces related to that the

412
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,660
first one is their HR department or the

413
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,130
office of personal management which is

414
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,930
basically the HR department for the

415
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,530
largest employer in the United States

416
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,080
they were not encrypting Social Security

417
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,490
numbers at rest I don't know what other

418
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,370
p I i wasn't being encrypted at rest but

419
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,340
that's a basic principle of security now

420
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,890
to be fair encryption does not

421
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,130
completely protect you they can decrypt

422
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,200
that data potentially but at least make

423
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,880
it a little harder the piece that came

424
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,040
out yesterday that just really blew my

425
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,699
mind was the sf-86 database was breached

426
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,619
for the second time and what that

427
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,020
database is is if you're a federal

428
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,000
employee and you are required to have a

429
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,760
security clearance there is a hundred

430
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,740
and twenty seven page form that you have

431
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,329
to fill out that you're pretty much

432
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,050
pouring out your entire life on there if

433
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,690
somebody wanted to compromise you that

434
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,850
is the key to your castle because

435
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,020
they're going to find out your tax

436
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,760
returns they're going to find out what

437
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,590
financial institutions you work with

438
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,450
they're going to find out what foreign

439
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,160
nationals you communicate with on a

440
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,870
regular basis they're going to find out

441
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,150
your drug history your financial history

442
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,140
in terms of like if you've had

443
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,020
bankruptcies it's a Bible on your life

444
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,200
effectively and that database was

445
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,440
breached as I said for the second time

446
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,600
it actually happened previously last

447
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,929
year

448
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,040
the first layer of impact in terms of

449
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,900
the four million current and former

450
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,730
employees that's devastating by itself

451
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,730
that's 4.1 million people who just got

452
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,850
pantsed in the public sector in terms of

453
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,020
their ability to interact and do

454
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,340
transactions but the sf-86 breach really

455
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,990
put a lot of people at risk and frankly

456
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,690
put our country at risk because one of

457
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,400
the commentator you know part of the

458
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
commentary that's been coming out of

459
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,540
this is you know if China was in fact

460
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,850
the country that did this and the

461
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,070
evidence appears to be strong but again

462
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,420
the government saying what they're

463
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,860
saying you know do you trust him do you

464
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,020
not but if in fact it was the Chinese

465
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,710
government you now have a large amount

466
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,070
of data to manipulate an individual to

467
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,570
do things that ordinarily they wouldn't

468
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,559
want to do and so the ability to turn

469
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,830
people into spies and that sounds very

470
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,080
Tom Clancy asked but that's the reality

471
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,300
of what this happened now the one good

472
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,850
news was most CIA personnel wasn't part

473
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,170
of this database it's actually a

474
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,480
separate entity but it's still federal

475
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,830
government employees that have a high

476
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,570
security clearance oh by the way that

477
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,360
includes NSA employees there's something

478
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,630
to bear in mind one of the things that I

479
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,500
thought that was particularly

480
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,660
interesting was the Office of Personnel

481
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,250
Management did not have a security

482
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,210
department until 2013 which just really

483
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,730
is is that the era that we live in and

484
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,730
the other thing I thought was staggering

485
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,090
as well is in order to externally access

486
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,090
their network they did not have to

487
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,230
provide any second factors of

488
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,130
authentication so any device anywhere

489
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,240
could get into that network with a

490
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,890
single compromised credentials so you

491
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,480
can probably guess what the forensics

492
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,820
reports going to look like when they

493
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,770
come back and they say how did they get

494
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,540
in pretty straightforward as I've noted

495
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,800
here and it's going to be linked on the

496
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,150
slides and one thing I did was say I

497
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,700
will make the slides available on

498
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,690
SlideShare after this talk tonight and

499
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,100
the wired article that I linked in there

500
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,450
is a must read on the breach and there's

501
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,920
going to be much better journalism that

502
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,390
takes place but the wired article at

503
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,100
least frames a lot of this some of which

504
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,460
I frankly borrow

505
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,169
a little bit in terms of the talk but

506
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,240
it's just a good primer on it and it's a

507
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,000
good thing to be educated on the other

508
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,140
thing I thought that was interesting and

509
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,460
you guys obviously already read it by

510
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,919
now they didn't find this out by one of

511
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,570
their administrators or the Secret

512
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,309
Service knocking on their door they were

513
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,539
getting a demo from a vendor that found

514
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,880
this breach taking place of course the

515
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,929
vendor at this point I can't even

516
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,130
remember their name at the buoyant it's

517
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,380
actually mentioned in the wired article

518
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,720
they've got to be going to Ching you

519
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,720
know you know you can't get better

520
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,299
advertising than that you know and

521
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,010
that's obviously bittersweet because

522
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,539
there's millions of people that are

523
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,309
going to be impacted by this and that's

524
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,679
the thing that just makes my blood boil

525
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,860
about it is we should be expecting a

526
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,929
better OPSEC from our government on that

527
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,580
obviously add Snowden proved that we

528
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,409
don't have very good OPSEC to begin with

529
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,529
but you should expect being a public

530
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,029
employee that they're going to protect

531
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,830
your data better and as a taxpayer we

532
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,240
should be expecting that as well because

533
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,909
as the IRS just proved they're not doing

534
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:14,640
such a good job either so what does all

535
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,580
of this tell us well the first is the

536
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,200
threat landscape obviously is changing

537
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,340
daily that's one of the reasons why I

538
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,929
picked those breach examples is they've

539
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,500
all happened in the last six months as I

540
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,630
mentioned early on the elevation or

541
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,370
compromised the privileged access is a

542
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,960
key stage and one hundred percent of all

543
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,220
attacks and that may be coming out a

544
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,419
little bit dark but it's a hundred

545
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,770
percent that's from the cyber sheath

546
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,580
report this is basically the critical

547
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,080
attack vector out there this is why

548
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,770
identity basically the recent verizon

549
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,090
data breach investigation report

550
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,620
basically said that one hundred percent

551
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,510
of the data breaches involve the use of

552
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,490
compromised credentials whether it's you

553
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,080
know getting that privilege escalation

554
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,700
or getting in the front door through a

555
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,750
phishing attack so before we start

556
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,610
talking about identity management as a

557
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,720
whole in drilling into some of the

558
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,720
programs it probably helps to kind of

559
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,909
lay the groundwork as to what identity

560
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,010
management is and I'm borrowing a

561
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,789
Gartner definition that is adequate but

562
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,649
obviously will overlay some context to

563
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:14,909
kind of broaden the definition a little

564
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,399
bit and it's a set of business processes

565
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:19,470
and supporting infrastructure for the

566
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,820
creation maintenance and use of digital

567
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,320
identities and I promise that will be

568
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,710
the last slide that I actually

569
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,279
off of but you know one of the things I

570
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,659
like about the definition is the first

571
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,059
word that comes out as processes and

572
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,190
that's a piece that insecurity we don't

573
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,850
talk enough about as with the gate with

574
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,640
my pony as with the gates within your

575
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,250
company how people get access to systems

576
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,830
and the gates that they go through are

577
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,990
often the weakest links in that equation

578
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,159
and part of it's because you've got

579
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,190
human beings doing the work with them

580
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,169
you can put all the IDS's and IPS and

581
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:55,120
firewalls out there in the world but if

582
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,559
you don't have people operating those

583
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,299
gates appropriately or approving

584
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,159
accessing those gates appropriately

585
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,340
you're at risk ultimately identity

586
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,710
management is about user time device and

587
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,419
location and that list is not meant to

588
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,450
be exhaustive but what it creates is a

589
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,909
context and the good news is that's

590
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,340
actually helping us in the war in

591
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,070
securing identities is our knowledge of

592
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,480
what a user is doing and more

593
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,890
importantly what they should be doing or

594
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,140
what should be normal is improving

595
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,340
dramatically and I think that's going to

596
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,750
help us long term and I'll talk about a

597
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,309
little bit about that when we talk a

598
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,760
note about authentication so these are

599
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,980
the four programs and plus a note at the

600
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,190
bottom that are typically mentioned when

601
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,960
we talk about reducing risk within an

602
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,549
identity and access management program

603
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:40,570
the first ones user management

604
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,090
provisioning then entitlement management

605
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,010
privileged access management which was

606
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,720
actually the talk that I gave last year

607
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,520
and I would suppose we'll spend a little

608
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,830
bit of time on that Federation both in

609
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,299
terms of provisioning and single sign-on

610
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,669
and then finally I'll talk a little bit

611
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:58,120
about authentication provisioning is

612
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,799
what most people think identity

613
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,080
management is it's the process of

614
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,909
getting a user that you know a new

615
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,710
employee walks into your company you get

616
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,120
them their network ID you get them

617
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,370
access to particular systems and it's

618
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,230
the processes that goes on behind that

619
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,070
too you know crud create update delete

620
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,610
that users access oftentimes you'll get

621
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,559
attributes or authoritative sources from

622
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,720
many different places hris systems are

623
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,360
typically the most common one but when

624
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,590
you're dealing with partners they may be

625
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,120
coming from from other sources as well

626
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,070
ultimately within that piece the

627
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,870
processes as I mentioned are what drives

628
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,100
the events around at an employee

629
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,630
entering the organization or you may

630
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,130
have a new contract with a partner in

631
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,809
the case of Merck you know we may have a

632
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:44,370
new contract with a clinical research

633
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,899
organization that's going to conduct a

634
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,010
trial for us testing a particular

635
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,149
pharmaceutical you know effectiveness

636
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,890
those processes will vary based on the

637
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,830
types of users in your organization key

638
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,240
protocols and standards that are related

639
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,750
to this obviously ldap is a very common

640
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,090
one SPM L won't spend a lot of time on

641
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,250
because frankly it's old and a lot of

642
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,529
people avoid using it and that's frankly

643
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,799
for good reason skim is an emerging

644
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,210
standard and I'll talk a little bit more

645
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,529
about that later and then there's also

646
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,289
the WS star spectrum of protocols that

647
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,980
are used for that as well entitlement

648
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,299
management is sometimes referred to as

649
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,490
access control or access management and

650
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,320
what it is is it's kind of another tier

651
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,840
provisioning it's okay I have an ID now

652
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,909
what can I get access to and sometimes

653
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:34,529
it can be as mundane as just adding a

654
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,059
user to an Active Directory security

655
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,460
group or it could be policy-based where

656
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,919
you're evaluating an attribute of a user

657
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,419
within their organization determine if

658
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,909
they have access to something oftentimes

659
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,559
this is kind of described as the next

660
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
phase of maturity for companies that are

661
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,830
getting into the identity management

662
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,529
space because you want to you know now

663
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:54,480
you know okay they have easy access to

664
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,429
things they're able to get into doing

665
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,289
their job now what do they have access

666
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,700
to and how can we manage and control

667
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,740
that and keep protocols within this area

668
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,390
Samuel is one of them with respect to

669
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,409
what we call the just-in-time

670
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:09,450
provisioning profile and I'll talk a

671
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,799
little bit more about Samuel in the

672
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,779
Federation side SP Mel's mentioned again

673
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,409
I also WS star exactly which stands for

674
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,360
the extensible access control markup

675
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,840
language which is a mouthful is also key

676
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,360
here I would also include oh off in here

677
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,350
but I'm gonna talk a little bit more

678
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,850
about that later and then obviously held

679
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,929
up as well privileged access management

680
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:33,870
is kind of that next tier of maturity of

681
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,510
your identity management program

682
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,299
obviously the name is kind of self

683
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,549
intuitive it's really focusing on those

684
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,680
identities in your enterprise that cab

685
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,390
you know proverbial keys to the castle

686
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,430
where those keys are though I would

687
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,500
encourage you to kind of include have a

688
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,290
holistic perspective a good example of

689
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,640
that one of the breaches that I used to

690
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,010
talk about was it Saudi Aramco an

691
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,350
insider found out he was about to get

692
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,150
laid off and he happened to have the

693
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,830
insider knowledge that every single one

694
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,330
of their pc's was controlled by the same

695
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,970
local admin password so he executed a

696
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,400
script to wipe 30,000 hard drives of all

697
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,840
of their pcs so most people don't think

698
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,640
of that as a privileged account because

699
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,500
it's not a critical system account in

700
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,630
the server you know client-server sense

701
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,960
but it also manages what your client can

702
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,730
do and when you get into the malware

703
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,590
space if they don't have the ability to

704
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,530
execute malware oftentimes you prevent

705
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,120
that malware from even taking a foothold

706
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,070
in the workstation so it's one of the

707
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,430
things think about within privileged

708
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,170
access management or Pam the focus

709
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,060
really is on auditing and compliance and

710
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,620
what controls you have in place who has

711
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,870
access to the system how did they get

712
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,820
that access who approved it what did

713
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,200
they do well they have it if they have

714
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,800
you know root access to a Linux system

715
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,640
you know what commands are they

716
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,610
executing and that's where you get into

717
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,960
you know the key use cases within this

718
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,300
space our password vaulting and Susteren

719
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,120
session management or and recording that

720
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,340
list is by no means exhaustive but you

721
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,230
know that's the traditional one so you

722
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,090
go to your privileged access management

723
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,130
system you check out that password you

724
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,450
log into the system do what you need to

725
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,950
do you check that account back in as I

726
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,150
stayed at the bottom this is a critical

727
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,850
area for modern enterprises as we've

728
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,200
already talked about with respect to the

729
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,550
breach this is where privilege

730
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,920
escalation can happen it's not the only

731
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,750
method of achieving it obviously a

732
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,850
sequel injection can sometimes achieve

733
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,610
the same benefit but the easiest way is

734
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,340
to compromise a privileged identity and

735
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,750
if you have a mature privileged access

736
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,720
management program it's not going to

737
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,340
prevent somebody from getting onto your

738
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,560
network but it might slow them down or

739
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,210
discourage them in terms of what they do

740
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,460
and they might eventually give up we

741
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,750
hope one note on this with respect to

742
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,040
cloud vendors are still struggling with

743
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,210
us a little bit there's a couple of

744
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,460
that are targeting cloud systems in

745
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,890
particular for example amazon so if you

746
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,659
have infrastructure-as-a-service I if I

747
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,250
took a poll in here I suspect there be a

748
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,720
majority of people saying that you know

749
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,429
our company has some instances on Amazon

750
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:10,950
or other cloud service providers one of

751
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,240
the challenges with the enterprise

752
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,039
privileged access management systems is

753
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,450
their ability to talk to those

754
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,090
identities and for example change their

755
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,289
passwords when their sessions are

756
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,470
complete is not quite there yet I think

757
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,850
API is are going to be the key to that

758
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,059
and the vendors are recognizing that but

759
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,710
they're not quite there yet you do have

760
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,179
some specialists in that space but

761
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,399
oftentimes what you wind up doing is for

762
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,169
larger enterprises you wind up buying an

763
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,029
enterprise Pam tool and then you buy the

764
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:38,130
cloud tool to supplement it hopefully

765
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,779
those guys are going to you know

766
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,270
converge at some point the one thing I

767
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,500
will comment on this and this was a

768
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,710
theme in my talk from last year is don't

769
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,980
think in terms of just tooling in that

770
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,690
you know especially for if you're small

771
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,580
or medium business well I can't afford

772
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,110
to do this don't think of it just in

773
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,270
terms of tooling you can adopt processes

774
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,700
again getting back to that p-word you

775
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,289
can adopt processes to manage your

776
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,179
privileged identities that will continue

777
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,250
to protect you better it doesn't make it

778
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,840
foolproof but don't think just in terms

779
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,460
of the tooling think of the processes

780
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,779
that you can put behind that Federation

781
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,179
is a broad term I'm not referring to

782
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,169
start track basically it involves the

783
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:21,149
creation it's a reflection of the

784
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,440
contracts that you have with outside

785
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,659
vendors and most of you if you work in

786
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,760
an average company today probably have

787
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,169
at least one Federation connection and

788
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,390
what it's designed to do and it's a good

789
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,940
thing is to prevent you having to

790
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,649
memorize another credential to access an

791
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,809
external or SAS service they're

792
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,549
basically going to take my existence as

793
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,500
Lance Peterman at Merck and when I go to

794
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,570
success factors I'm still Lance Peterman

795
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,270
at Merck and instead of me having to you

796
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,210
know in securely entering a username and

797
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,919
password it's now going to pass a token

798
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,870
to them in a much more secure format to

799
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,330
reflect that trust relationship and

800
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,070
they're going to say ok I trust that

801
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,120
this is Lance Peterman simple use cases

802
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,200
single sign on is probably the one that

803
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,299
people can relate to when I talk to

804
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,710
people about identity management that's

805
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,909
usually what they sink their teeth into

806
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,700
initially but provisioning is also a

807
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,889
part of this and it's it's probably the

808
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:11,220
tricky

809
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,460
just aspect because it's the idea that

810
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,690
you know let's take for example office

811
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,720
365 how many people use office 365 or

812
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,450
Google Apps you know one of the

813
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,919
challenges for the enterprise in that

814
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,049
space is well how do I securely give my

815
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,510
user access to that without either

816
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,850
having to create a microsoft asia i ad

817
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,630
account or a google account and have

818
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,080
them memorized yet another credential

819
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,299
but more importantly when even if I am

820
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,130
federating allowing them to login using

821
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,110
their base company Pradesh credential

822
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,600
how do i create that account in a timely

823
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,070
fashion that gives them the axis that

824
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,710
they need when they need it and that's

825
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,890
what federation provisioning is

826
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,530
attempting to do oftentimes this is

827
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,179
occurring I think there's a vendor here

828
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,460
today that has a you know some libraries

829
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,140
that allow you to do this a lot of times

830
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,490
this is through data synchronization

831
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,730
which is terrible what you really want

832
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,200
to shoot for is what they call jit or

833
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,000
just-in-time provisioning so if I mean

834
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,309
new employee and I'm going to office 365

835
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,799
for the first time it goes oh you're a

836
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,659
merc employee I'll go ahead and create

837
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,330
your act your account and then I'm a on

838
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,090
the backend have somebody provision the

839
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,830
access for that user with respect to

840
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,299
access our entitlement management this

841
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,799
is where it can be getting a little

842
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,570
tricky that's one of the things that you

843
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,820
want to think about if you're working

844
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,530
without identity management and you're

845
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,929
working with SAS vendors is how do I

846
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:39,090
manage the lifecycle of that user and

847
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,669
their access to that system the good

848
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,860
news if you're enabling Federation is if

849
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,020
you disable the base account the front

850
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,659
door is closed for them to get access

851
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,070
that's the good news the problem is if

852
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,780
you're paying per user you're still

853
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,370
paying for that license until you remove

854
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,630
it and that can sometimes be a

855
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,120
considerable cost savings or cost

856
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,010
inhibitor depending upon the number of

857
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,400
users that you're talking about as I

858
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,020
mentioned you know cloud is making this

859
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,390
a little bit tougher when I talk through

860
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,299
the help is on the way part you know we

861
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,070
will get into that a little bit the

862
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,780
older provisioning standards for this

863
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,940
weather it's SP ml whether it's the ws

864
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,059
fed piece they're brutal to implement

865
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,299
and vendors just simply have an adopt

866
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:24,980
and and so one of the things within the

867
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,019
identity management industry is they're

868
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:28,730
trying to come up with better ways of

869
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,860
doing this they think they've achieved

870
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,600
this with skim and i'll talk about skim

871
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,249
a little bit in a second so note about

872
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,549
authentication as long as passwords

873
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:43,879
exist and they're the most convenient

874
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:46,850
way of authenticating a user our systems

875
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,730
are at risk you guys know this it's the

876
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,059
most brutal aspect of system security so

877
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:54,769
I would encourage you within your

878
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,179
enterprise even if this isn't going to

879
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:58,639
be your focus when you're engaging with

880
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,139
vendors what other methods of

881
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,519
authentication are they capable of

882
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,100
supporting biometrics is becoming huge

883
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,590
sometimes just the interaction with you

884
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,569
know mobile device management from you

885
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:10,280
know i'll pick on Apple initially you

886
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,139
know with touch ID you know what other

887
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,399
things can i do to identify a user than

888
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,069
simply a password where are they logging

889
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:21,049
in from what device are they logging in

890
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:23,719
from is their mobile device nearby you

891
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,309
know dude can you detect that proximity

892
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:27,440
it's what we call contextual or

893
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,569
continuous authentication those type of

894
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,119
things over time I'll admit these aren't

895
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,520
a hundred percent here yet there's a lot

896
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,168
of vendors that will argue with me on

897
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:37,159
that because they'll say we have a

898
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,569
product we can sell you and they might

899
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:40,790
work but in the enterprise the ability

900
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,829
to scale them and scale is the challenge

901
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:45,739
they're not quite there yet but I think

902
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,879
this is going to be one of the key

903
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,710
pieces to securing the enterprise better

904
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,219
or securing users better and just on a

905
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,829
personal note if you go to a service and

906
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,030
they have multi-factor authentication

907
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,390
available to you use it take advantage

908
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,829
of it hopefully they've done it well

909
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,569
where you could use something like

910
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:04,940
of--they or Google Authenticator or

911
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,579
other common you know obviously you

912
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,650
don't want 15 different apps on your on

913
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,109
your iPhone for doing multi-factor

914
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,180
authentication but if they have it

915
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,950
available to you take advantage of it

916
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,710
because the ability for a user to

917
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,420
compromise your account is greatly

918
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,540
diminished it's not eliminated but it is

919
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,710
greatly diminished when you have

920
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,430
multi-factor authentication the good

921
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,910
news is help us on the way eventually

922
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,190
and I say that just because there are

923
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,770
some standards that are emerging but

924
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,210
some of them haven't even been ratified

925
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,690
yet but but they're coming and I want

926
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,700
you guys to have kind of to be able to

927
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,559
walk away with these standards put them

928
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,539
in your data dictionary and so when you

929
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:48,859
are talking with vendors or you're

930
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,720
evaluating a product what is their

931
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,309
ability to support this even if they

932
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:54,589
can't support it today can they put it

933
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:55,970
on their roadmap or is it on their

934
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,140
roadmap because that will give you a

935
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,079
sense in terms of where the vendors are

936
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,390
at in terms of thinking about security

937
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,230
you know we had a great conversation

938
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,809
towards the end of the last talk about

939
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:09,230
what can developers do to better secure

940
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,329
their applications what things can they

941
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:13,549
think about the number one answer I

942
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:16,039
would give them in that space is don't

943
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,650
create yet another login and

944
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,020
registration for the user don't create

945
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,609
another account if you can avoid it

946
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:24,710
sometimes it's unavoidable but put a

947
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,829
price on that because if you do it makes

948
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:29,059
it less likely for you to do it it's

949
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,440
going to make your app first of all

950
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,079
easier to use and second of all more

951
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,930
secure so the first one we'll talk about

952
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,069
is 0 off more specifically oh off to

953
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:41,930
this standard has been around for a few

954
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,599
years now it was around previously in a

955
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,750
different version but but oauth2 I think

956
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,029
was ratified about four years ago it

957
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:52,220
does the auth in it stands for

958
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,589
authorization not authentication a lot

959
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,210
of people confuse that because there is

960
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,490
an authentication transaction that takes

961
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,319
place within an OAuth flow and if this

962
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,119
were a longer talk I would go through

963
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,119
what that flow looks like but it's

964
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,339
important to distinguish that

965
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,750
particularly when I talk about open ID

966
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,020
connect it gained a lot of maturity with

967
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,359
the second release but I will say it's

968
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,890
more of a framework than a protocol a

969
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,900
protocol has a lot more maturity and

970
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,910
control around it you have a lot of

971
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,740
flexibility with OAuth in terms of how

972
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,180
you implement it and as a result you

973
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,589
have a lot of flexibility with how

974
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,900
securely you implement it and that's

975
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,710
part of the challenge this really is

976
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,520
becoming the vector for leveraging API

977
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,369
security so this is an area where if you

978
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,650
are a developer knowing off what will

979
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,500
certainly be to your advantage one of

980
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,849
the things i do like about it is

981
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,039
there are several RFC's that are tied to

982
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,349
it one of them is dedicated to itself as

983
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:51,749
its own threat model so this is the one

984
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,130
that you can have developers take a look

985
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,839
at and understand what are the typical

986
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,960
threat patterns within this model to

987
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,900
code against and make sure it kind of

988
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,049
provides you a not so brief about best

989
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:07,140
practices excuse me there's still a lot

990
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,369
of great development going on within

991
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,410
this standard and I included the link

992
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,779
there at the bottom I've already

993
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:15,329
mentioned skim a few times it has an

994
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:17,579
unfortunate name for that acronym it

995
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,109
used to be a lot easier it was simple

996
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:20,729
cloud identity management which is much

997
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:23,549
nicer to say the system for cross domain

998
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:25,349
identity management obviously a little

999
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:26,910
tougher but they did that for a reason

1000
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,660
and really it's designed to be for

1001
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,589
everything within the enterprise not

1002
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,239
just simply managing identities in the

1003
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,819
cloud this is basically the answer to

1004
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,359
the giant the ginormous albatross that

1005
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,210
SP ml was it's much lighter it's much

1006
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,369
more friendly it's based on JSON instead

1007
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:49,289
of XML and it's got a lot of promise I

1008
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:51,329
call it an emerging standard because it

1009
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,789
is right now the most mature spec is the

1010
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,400
11 which has some gaps in it from an

1011
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,460
enterprise context but the key challenge

1012
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,200
here is the low adoption rate so this is

1013
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,700
again where I make the appeal to you

1014
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,769
guys with the companies that you work

1015
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,529
for or work with if you're a software

1016
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,769
vendor please take this appeal gets Kim

1017
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:13,170
enabled in your product set because long

1018
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,749
term it's going to make your life easier

1019
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:17,729
and your customers are going to be a lot

1020
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:20,609
happier but what it ultimately allows

1021
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,289
you to do is have a means of

1022
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,680
communication with your federated system

1023
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,579
whether it's out in the cloud or it

1024
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:27,930
isn't it can even be within your

1025
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,729
enterprise but it gives you a sin a

1026
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:31,890
common library to communicate user

1027
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,989
provisioning events create this user

1028
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,119
with these attributes give them this

1029
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,400
level of access and it can be customized

1030
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,440
every organization treats their org as

1031
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,369
though it's through this unique

1032
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,829
snowflake this allows for some of the

1033
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:45,869
unique snowflake pieces to it through

1034
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:49,319
some of the schema designs that you can

1035
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,239
do in the 2 point 0 spec the 2 point 0

1036
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,279
spec is in the process of being ratified

1037
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:56,219
I think it's like literally weeks away

1038
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,289
from being official but the good news is

1039
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:58,630
mo

1040
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,829
of the visionary I am vendors out there

1041
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:04,900
like I'm not gonna throw their names out

1042
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,460
here if you want to know talk to me

1043
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,890
later but they already know this and

1044
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,569
they're already in compliance with the 2

1045
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,099
point 0 specification because it's

1046
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,299
pretty much been locked they just

1047
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:17,549
haven't ratified it yet open ID connect

1048
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:20,500
you know how I mentioned that oooff

1049
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,289
doesn't have an identity layer or

1050
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:25,119
technically doesn't this is what open ID

1051
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,809
connect is designed to do it provides a

1052
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,779
transaction layer specific to identity

1053
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:34,180
specific to authentication that allows

1054
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,130
you to create a what they call an ID

1055
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,680
token for the user within the oauth

1056
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,240
pattern you can present a token and it

1057
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,509
just says i'm tom it doesn't say how i

1058
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,000
established that i'm tom the relying

1059
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,349
party is actually just trusting that

1060
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:49,809
that transaction took place this is

1061
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:51,579
ultimately kind of viewed there is some

1062
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,740
interoperability with sam'l so it could

1063
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,750
still be part of this profile but

1064
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,099
ultimately it's designed to replace

1065
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:58,720
samuel if you don't know what Samuel is

1066
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,250
it stands for security assertion markup

1067
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,109
language it's part of the Federation

1068
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,420
protocol stack it's easily the most

1069
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,700
mature ways that your companies will

1070
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,619
federated a but this is the next

1071
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,009
generation of it it is fully ratified it

1072
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:14,289
has a lot better mobile use cases in it

1073
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,509
even though that's still completing a

1074
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,390
little bit one of the things that I

1075
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,160
really like about open ID connect

1076
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,140
especially because it's a profile of

1077
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,509
OAuth 2 one of the challenges with OAuth

1078
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,759
2 is you don't really have a good cook

1079
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:29,950
book that says this is the best way to

1080
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,710
implement you know this framework from a

1081
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,710
security perspective there is now a

1082
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,599
certification model that was created by

1083
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,910
the open ID foundation for open ID

1084
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,670
connect that will allow your security

1085
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,289
vendors if they're leveraging open ID

1086
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:46,210
connect they can now certify themselves

1087
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,849
against that standard so again that's

1088
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:50,349
one of those conversations that you can

1089
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:52,630
have when the vendor says yes we support

1090
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,599
open ID connect are you certified or is

1091
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,339
the is the vendor that you're using to

1092
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:58,990
achieve that certified it's a great way

1093
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,779
to measure them against I would highly

1094
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:03,279
recommend getting this on your internal

1095
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:05,140
development roadmap especially if you're

1096
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,150
using other methods of authenticating

1097
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,720
users today from a federation standpoint

1098
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,980
you'll find that these libraries are

1099
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,549
very

1100
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:15,729
easy to use and I'll put a little star

1101
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:19,089
on that nothing is you know when you're

1102
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,819
coding users it's never completely easy

1103
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,499
to use but it's much easier I guess it

1104
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,119
would be a better way and then finally

1105
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,880
there's the girl at the bottom of it

1106
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,920
this is a slight plug for an

1107
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,259
organization that I am a part of is

1108
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:35,380
anybody in this room familiar with the

1109
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,939
national strategy for trusted identities

1110
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:42,579
in cyberspace and nobody raised their

1111
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:45,459
hand just in case you were wondering and

1112
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:46,869
it saddens me a little bit but I'm not

1113
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,849
blaming anybody because it's one of the

1114
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:51,039
most poorly publicized achievements in

1115
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,829
my opinion whatever your opinion of the

1116
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:58,019
Obama administration is in 2011

1117
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:00,189
President Obama signed this executive

1118
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:03,039
order and what I mean the name is pretty

1119
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,459
of evidential it's designed around it's

1120
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,400
a very well written document around

1121
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,679
creating a framework for allowing users

1122
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,549
not just in the US but really globally

1123
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:17,559
to have more secure transactions online

1124
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:20,289
and one of the groups that's an offshoot

1125
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:21,999
of this that was funded by the mystic

1126
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,529
initiative is the identity ecosystem

1127
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:25,689
steering group and that's the group that

1128
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:29,259
I'm a volunteer member of i admit i'm

1129
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:30,729
more of a lurker than a contributor

1130
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:33,130
because of my day job but i would

1131
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,929
encourage anybody even if you don't have

1132
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:37,150
the bandwidth to contribute if you want

1133
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,499
to better understand what they're doing

1134
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:43,179
here you know you can sit in the plenary

1135
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:45,400
sessions are open to anybody and it's

1136
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,079
some pretty fascinating stuff going on

1137
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:49,059
here the one thing I will say this is

1138
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,009
not a national ID program because that's

1139
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:52,719
one of the most common misunderstandings

1140
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,959
with respect to mystic and I dsg it's

1141
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:58,269
really a public-private partnership it's

1142
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,369
looking at the big identity players out

1143
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:02,469
there today or maybe an emerging

1144
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:04,949
identity player or identity provider and

1145
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,959
saying how can we create a trust

1146
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:10,359
framework that's not just isolated to

1147
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,390
single contract relationships and how

1148
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,099
can we make it more global to where I

1149
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:16,749
could literally use and I'm not going to

1150
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:19,989
say we're going to go to the I to utopia

1151
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:22,359
of I'll have a single user name and

1152
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,560
password that i can use wherever I go

1153
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,400
but if we can reduce 254 to maybe five

1154
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,230
that'd be a huge help i think and i hope

1155
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,510
everybody agrees with me on that they

1156
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,280
have some really amazing pilots going on

1157
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,420
the one that i want to mention is

1158
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,060
actually taking place in North Carolina

1159
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,470
with respect to the supplemental

1160
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,970
nutrition assistance program if you're

1161
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,320
not familiar with that that's the

1162
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,320
renaming of food stamps and one of the

1163
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,700
challenges that the food stamps program

1164
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,680
has and it's not unique to North

1165
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,380
Carolina is getting people to enroll

1166
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,030
they have to go into these regional

1167
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,010
offices in order to sign up and you know

1168
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,690
especially in the rural areas of North

1169
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,360
Carolina that could be cumbersome so

1170
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,200
what they're doing in this pilot is most

1171
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,180
people have a driver's license one of

1172
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,470
the problems is we can't take that

1173
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,060
drivers license into the digital world

1174
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,250
and have it be an identity but what

1175
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,020
they've done I think this is pretty

1176
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,090
clever is they have their own app for

1177
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,960
enrollment so and I the irony is not

1178
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,910
lost on me the idea that somebody who's

1179
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,530
enrolling for food stamps also happens

1180
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,730
to have a smartphone but they're

1181
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,270
becoming that ubiquitous in our country

1182
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,400
so for those that do they can go to the

1183
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,360
website on their mobile device and as

1184
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,190
part of the enrollment process they will

1185
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,260
allow the user to take a selfie and it's

1186
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,900
done in real time to avoid fraud but

1187
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,700
they'll allow the user to take a selfie

1188
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,410
and then what they do is they compared

1189
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,650
using facial recognition that face

1190
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,080
versus the face on their drivers license

1191
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,920
and they train in you'll be amazed with

1192
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,660
facial recognition technology how close

1193
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,490
they're getting to really identifying

1194
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,890
people it's you know it's one of those

1195
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,500
Minority Report level you know type both

1196
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,380
fascinating and creepy at the same time

1197
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,660
pieces but for these people who are

1198
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,760
having to do this and having enroll in

1199
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,140
this is a huge convenience to them

1200
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,160
because now that I've officially

1201
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,920
enrolled you go back to the IRS breach

1202
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,260
how did I identify that person I relied

1203
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,750
on some public knowledge to do that but

1204
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,190
if I'm able to take their drivers

1205
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,200
license and use a real time photo of

1206
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,720
that person the odds of a fraudulent

1207
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,700
transaction taking place there are

1208
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,920
greatly reduced they're not eliminated

1209
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,540
this is all about risk reduction not

1210
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,700
risk elimination so I think that's a

1211
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,320
pretty neat program that's just one of

1212
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,920
the pilots that has been fun

1213
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,150
out of this initiative they're taking

1214
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,020
place all over the country but again you

1215
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,079
know I think as security professionals I

1216
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,270
think this is an area that I hope this

1217
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,520
will peak some interest for you and even

1218
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,540
if you're not going to the plenary

1219
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,740
sessions pay attention to what's

1220
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,869
happening in that space and they

1221
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:57,569
actually hired a PR firm finally to kind

1222
00:46:57,569 --> 00:46:59,069
of broadcast the message a little bit

1223
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,170
better we know in the security world we

1224
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,180
do a terrible job of telling our success

1225
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,309
stories that usually the stories that

1226
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:07,260
show up are the failures the Sony's the

1227
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,200
anthems the targets of the world and the

1228
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,400
link at the bottom is there so what are

1229
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,099
some keys to success with any identity

1230
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,900
management program the first and most

1231
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,299
obvious one is if you're going to do

1232
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,450
this have support from your senior

1233
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,970
leadership because some of these pieces

1234
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,950
not all of them the good news with

1235
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,569
identity management is oftentimes you're

1236
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:32,670
making lives easier you know when you're

1237
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,559
doing single sign-on and you're telling

1238
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,270
a user you know what I already know who

1239
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,040
you are so I'm going to let you into

1240
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,480
this website i'm not even going to make

1241
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,240
you use your username and password they

1242
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,460
love that that that's the happy story

1243
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,869
with identity management the pain in the

1244
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:48,329
butt is with Pam oftentimes and other

1245
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,099
controls that you put in place but if

1246
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,380
you have that senior support senior

1247
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,450
leadership support and it is driven by

1248
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,549
policy and I can't stress this enough if

1249
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:58,710
you don't have policies around the use

1250
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,020
of identities in your enterprise if you

1251
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,809
can at all please get them adopted as

1252
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:05,220
I've mentioned this countless times

1253
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,700
focus on the people and process first

1254
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,829
the tooling will come but the the upside

1255
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:12,210
of focusing on people and processes

1256
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,680
first is that's going to drive a lot of

1257
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,299
your requirements and then you can

1258
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:16,349
figure out if you're getting the right

1259
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:19,619
tool for those be creative with identity

1260
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:22,559
management one size does not fit all you

1261
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,049
know enterprises come in big you know

1262
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:29,040
small medium tiny and you can use some

1263
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,609
of these tools at all of those levels

1264
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,160
when you are looking at a vendor look

1265
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,540
very closely at what their cloud

1266
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,160
capabilities are because obviously

1267
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,000
everything is moving outward I'd be

1268
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,160
picky in that the other piece don't be

1269
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,049
afraid to eat your own dog food first

1270
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:48,030
figure out what your user interface

1271
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,680
looks like for these tools if they are

1272
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,060
user facing

1273
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,640
you know and make sure that that you're

1274
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,140
using them in the way that your users

1275
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,100
would use them and that it's an

1276
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,480
experience that's pleasant for them in

1277
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,880
the past I'll be honest identity tools

1278
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,270
have been terrible at UX and so it's a

1279
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,710
painful experience even the password

1280
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,530
managers that are out there you know

1281
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,350
with the security questions just the

1282
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,300
interfaces are brewin alone they're

1283
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,510
finally getting better and then finally

1284
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,680
don't think you're too small for this

1285
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,840
even if you're a small business look at

1286
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,830
where your risk is within the

1287
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,210
organization that was a great thing that

1288
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,760
came out of the shades of red talk was

1289
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,350
you know even if you don't have the

1290
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,120
funding to engage a red team to figure

1291
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,350
out how you're going to you know

1292
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,690
brutalize your enterprise think about

1293
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,340
risk in your organization think about

1294
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,890
your business model and where is your

1295
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,230
risk at and even if you can only tackle

1296
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,730
those small things to help mitigate that

1297
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,950
risk you've done a tremendous service to

1298
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,990
your company and as security

1299
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,460
professionals that's ultimately what

1300
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,960
we're doing whether this is within your

1301
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,920
discipline or not and finally a note on

1302
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,710
security versus opportunity and really

1303
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,590
what this has meant to mean is the value

1304
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,840
proposition on identity and access

1305
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,120
management has changed in the past it's

1306
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,350
always been about two things either

1307
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,180
single sign-on which users love or

1308
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,060
putting those processes in place behind

1309
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,650
the scenes that the users really don't

1310
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,060
pay attention to its those pay no

1311
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,200
attention to the man behind the curtain

1312
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,270
activities that's really more classic

1313
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,030
security you know people love that you

1314
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,740
know you might have an intrusion

1315
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,390
detection system in your you know

1316
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,280
company or that you have great

1317
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,200
interfaces with your HR system to make

1318
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,120
sure that we revoke access in a timely

1319
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,980
fashion but the only time they pay

1320
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,930
attention to it is when things go wrong

1321
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:31,770
or things break you know protection and

1322
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,420
risk management are obviously still the

1323
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,940
primary drivers but as I mentioned with

1324
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,700
the open ID connect and the skin and the

1325
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,480
OAuth pieces identity can now be a

1326
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,760
little disruptive especially for your

1327
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,400
external relationships how many of you

1328
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,220
and if you don't know this it's okay but

1329
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,900
when you have an interaction with an

1330
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,610
external customer how many of you create

1331
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,520
an identity for that customer that you

1332
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,180
know of got a handful that's the common

1333
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,520
model that's what we do at Merck and

1334
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,560
we're trying to quote get out of that I

1335
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:04,890
did

1336
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,750
business we're partnering with a vendor

1337
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,960
that they're becoming our main IDP so

1338
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,880
that they can manage that relationship

1339
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,350
they can manage that proofing because

1340
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,520
that's one of the big challenges with

1341
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,690
the users if you're trying to do more

1342
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:19,140
secure transactions but that can be

1343
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,820
disruptive because for example with the

1344
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,530
strategic relationship we have at Merck

1345
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,300
that's probably the closest I'll give

1346
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,420
you it to the inside baseball at Merck

1347
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,170
you know one of the things we're trying

1348
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,660
to do is work with that vendor so that

1349
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,750
if they have that identity and they do

1350
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,760
business with Merck there's a good

1351
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,090
chance that organization or that partner

1352
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,640
or that doctor or that clinical trial

1353
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,590
participant they have a relationship

1354
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,570
with other members within the healthcare

1355
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,300
sector being able to use that same

1356
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,580
identity to go to each and every one of

1357
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,100
those vendors is a huge value add for

1358
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,720
the user because one of the biggest pain

1359
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,640
points and frankly we've lost business

1360
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,850
at times in terms of abilities companies

1361
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,730
wanting to work with us you know they

1362
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,020
may have to memorize up to five

1363
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,580
different credentials in order to access

1364
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,800
our various systems and a lot of that

1365
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,440
goes on the vendor because they don't

1366
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,150
have federation enabled for their

1367
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,190
products and as mature as Samuel is

1368
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:17,790
sam'l is a 15 year old standard and some

1369
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:18,960
of these vendors still haven't adopted

1370
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,260
it that's where this can be disruptive

1371
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,420
because the user now has a single

1372
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,690
credential with some support to access

1373
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:29,100
any of the systems that they need to get

1374
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,620
to within my company and whether it's

1375
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,390
hosted at my company or it's hosted in a

1376
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,280
provider and that's where the

1377
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,900
opportunity is for you as security

1378
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,180
professionals because when we reduce the

1379
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,070
number of credentials that the user has

1380
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,160
to do yes the attack surface reduced but

1381
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,510
now we can also make how those

1382
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,670
credentials are used much stronger you

1383
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,720
can't do that when you got five

1384
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,160
different credentials you have to secure

1385
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,290
and with continuous and contextual

1386
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,880
authentication we can now make that

1387
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,340
experience where it is much harder for a

1388
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,470
hacker to easily obtain a credential

1389
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,820
like they do with phishing attacks

1390
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,270
nowadays

1391
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:22,930
any questions yes sir oh that's a great

1392
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,360
question if you're referring to the

1393
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,580
company that I think of code space was

1394
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,480
the company that went out of business

1395
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,820
because of the breach this is a great

1396
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,070
cautionary tale and I almost feel bad

1397
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,030
that I didn't use it in my talk this was

1398
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,680
a company code space that all of their

1399
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,440
infrastructure was on Amazon and

1400
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,120
somebody took the route amazon

1401
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,110
credential and used that to delete every

1402
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:51,730
instance of servers for that company and

1403
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,370
if you're familiar at all using Amazon

1404
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,350
Web Services that does not take long to

1405
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,740
do it all now are their backups sure but

1406
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,600
what the company did in response to that

1407
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,890
was they took a look at what it was

1408
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,720
going to take to recover all of those

1409
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,820
instances and all of the data

1410
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,100
surrounding it and they basically said

1411
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,200
the cost to do that is going to be

1412
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,580
higher than our cost to stay in business

1413
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,860
and so they basically sent a note to all

1414
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,990
their customers and said we're closing

1415
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,660
our doors now that's obviously an

1416
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,520
extreme example of what you're referring

1417
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,370
to but that's the cautionary tale that

1418
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,950
identity provides if we don't adequately

1419
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,500
protect those identities any time you

1420
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,000
have those keys to the castle you have

1421
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,260
to protect those identities because

1422
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,760
that's what the hackers are going after

1423
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,710
that's what the attackers want is that

1424
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,270
elevation of privilege so they can

1425
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,590
really do the damage that they need

1426
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,570
whether it's exfiltrating data or in

1427
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,940
this case it was just drawing data it's

1428
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,420
a great question thank you for asking

1429
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,930
any other questions

1430
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,900
alright my understanding is we have some

1431
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,529
prizes to give away
