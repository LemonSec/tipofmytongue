1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
I saw the submission come through I

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,149
started geeking out and asking everybody

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,730
who is this county so I'm looking

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:16,350
forward to the stock so a little bit of

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,820
a quick story when I so submitted here i

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,010
thought that i was submitting to a town

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,170
that's about to annette hours from DC

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,350
Jefferson's house and it yeah so I

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,590
showed my my my girlfriend you know hey

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,540
I got accepted here and she's like

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,790
that's kind of a long drive I was like

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,170
oh what no no yes Charlotte which is not

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,350
sure what's built so so that's kind of

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,489
how I got here when I'm super excited to

15
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:04,260
be a Jame so so today we are going to

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,430
talk a little bit about

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,159
okay so today we are we are going to

18
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,860
talk about LTE security um there is a

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,070
much longer date our class I have

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,950
developed up about GSM UMTS and LTE and

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,149
LTE but this is basically a small and

22
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:35,740
quick dirty intro to LTE networks and

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,740
LTE security and we are really going to

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,250
look at it from a standards-based

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,539
perspective you see a lot of different

26
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,869
security claims about about LTE and

27
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,520
there was one that was really really

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,520
bothering me and that was the this whole

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
notion

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,370
and to end LTE security people were

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,760
basically saying that you know LTE is is

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,750
is encrypted from start to imagine so I

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,920
want to show some of the standards later

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,760
and show why that's probably not true

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,250
and you can make your own judgments but

36
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,439
I'm just showing you these the standards

37
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,230
and basically providing some evidence

38
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,420
about my security claims so we are we

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,760
are going to talk about different so

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,150
there are standards and importance other

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,970
concepts LTE network architectures the

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,650
security architecture and then I'll

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,190
provide some stuff for some further so

44
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,340
further reading so I have Josh Franklin

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:56,060
from DC 27 a totally 63 so yeah I do i

46
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,650
do work at a nest I I focus in public

47
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,230
safety networks mobile security hardware

48
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:11,379
roots of trust and electronic voting so

49
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,640
so what is LT LT LTE that is the long

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,860
term evolution that is the fourth I

51
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,610
could say for its 4G whatever whatever

52
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,930
that means it's basically be deployed

53
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,460
worldwide it's really really nice that

54
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,960
we're starting to have it a nice

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,570
worldwide send their standard before

56
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,100
it's kind of fractured you have gsm cdma

57
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,080
you're really really focusing on one us

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,790
sort of having our own little fight

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,230
without one and then we had whatever

60
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,270
Japan was doing

61
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,160
yeah so uh a LTE super super cool it's

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,230
probably here to stay for a long time so

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,070
it's it's definitely worth your time in

64
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,490
picking up some LTE knowledge here LTE

65
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,120
is is basically always evolving there's

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,470
a standards group called 3gpp that that

67
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,080
actually develops these of standards and

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,110
they drop of new releases which is

69
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,810
basically we have you know 400 documents

70
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,840
and worship stop adding the stop stop

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840
editing them now and that's called a of

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,680
fries or a release and so LTE release 12

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,490
is actually coming on in December 2014

74
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,920
but you know there's going to be you

75
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,010
know lte-advanced and then what does it

76
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,639
LTE be as what I hear three of three

77
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,430
to basically every new drop as

78
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,449
standards 3gpp is the standards body

79
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,889
that is that is actually developing

80
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,319
these standards the same standards

81
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,699
bonded both gsm and UMTS caesar come

82
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,199
completely open and viewable standards

83
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,300
it's not like it's not like I saw where

84
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,880
you have pain or forty five francs your

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,449
Swiss francs to look at mobile or

86
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,520
whatever it is 3gpp is actually made of

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,620
six different standards development

88
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,530
organizations that are basically from

89
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,509
different parts of the whole world you

90
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,400
see erith there Addis is the North

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,370
America's you see XE here also and

92
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,030
that's Europe's and Etsy does a lot of

93
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,550
the crypto standards so a lot of the the

94
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,750
base of the coin

95
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,230
there are other organ of organizations

96
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,810
3gpp2 which is the most confusing in the

97
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,380
whole world develops cma and their hold

98
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,740
their whole why and there's also the OBO

99
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,860
MX form which day Belvoir max 3gpp2 just

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,760
at a quick note was developing a cdma

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
variant

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,520
4G and it was called UMB and thankfully

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,800
they ate a stock and so America's all

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,060
moving towards the same technology there

105
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,270
ain't no long on it on bottle of this

106
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,970
3gpp has technical reports which kind of

107
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,889
more like book reports and you know

108
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,200
analyses and then there's there's actual

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,380
technical specifications which are

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,790
requirements documents you'll probably

111
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,550
have to read both cellar standards use

112
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,500
lots of jargon and and abbreviations

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,190
frequently nested acronyms are common

114
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,860
and this is one of the fun things I have

115
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,419
found a 3 a 3 depth nested acronym I was

116
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,370
you know I'm really really curious if

117
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,290
anyone else has seen any you know

118
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,960
anything that goes further so for

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,710
instance G ran stands for GPRS evolution

120
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,080
radio access network and GPRS stands for

121
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,330
like a general packet after i forget

122
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,360
what GPRS technically stands for so i've

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,100
seen four of those though and so you

124
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,380
know let me know if you find anything

125
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,400
deeper open challenge open challenge so

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,150
packets and circuits previously any

127
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,030
voice tect like basically any voice

128
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,820
technology was basically using a circuit

129
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,740
fork for communication which is

130
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,979
basically fixed fixed bandwidth you know

131
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,030
guaranteed bandwidth and you know that

132
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,720
that actually happened with the PSTN and

133
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,770
and it happened with gsm and and um TS

134
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,110
and so basically if you wanted data you

135
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,330
had to have distinct data networks and

136
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,440
so you had a gsm talking sorry a gsm

137
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,690
voice traffic going to the core network

138
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,690
and then you had a distinct GPRS packet

139
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,669
switched Network that had to converge on

140
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,950
the core network and so LTE is really

141
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,350
really different their LTE is completely

142
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,030
packet-based which is really really

143
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,690
interesting it there is volte which is

144
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,330
voice over LTE sorry voice over LTE

145
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,770
which is another that's the third that's

146
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,079
a third level nesib acronym right anyway

147
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,820
so so a VoIP is but is but one way of

148
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,400
doing voiceover over LTE there are a

149
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,850
bunch of others right now if you do make

150
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,110
a call on LT on LTE you are most likely

151
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,870
falling falling back to either CD cdma

152
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,890
gsm or um TS so it's not actually

153
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,360
implemented nationwide yet so the big

154
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,730
lesson here is LTE is completely

155
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,270
ip-based which actually means that a

156
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,390
once you like you can do a lot more with

157
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,570
with LTE networks now but it like now

158
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,430
that all the the different offensive

159
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,610
tools you know are all tcp/ip you know

160
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,350
you know packet based basically whereas

161
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,110
it's very very different in the past the

162
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,910
cellular standards this is how I think

163
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,860
of it you have 3gpp circuit-switched

164
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,540
which you see the the the gsm 2g tech

165
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,530
and you see the the UMTS 3g tech there

166
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,560
in that one column you have the 3gpp

167
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,830
packet-switched which is GPRS EDGE HSPA

168
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,580
family there's up there's a bunch of

169
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,200
those and then LTE 3gpp2 has cdma 12

170
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,670
thousand evdo the now dead um B&Y faxes

171
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,500
wife XY max is quickly dying and because

172
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,930
basically sprint invested heavily in

173
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,250
that upfront and they are now

174
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,760
transitioning to to LTE these are the

175
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
primary documents that you should

176
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,110
basically be aware of and i would just

177
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,240
recommend reading the first three if

178
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,760
you're interested it's not too difficult

179
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,010
that's probably 200 pages you know you

180
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,230
probably read longer books and 9th grade

181
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,680
right yeah yeah so these are you know

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,840
this is just a quick little collection

183
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
here we're going to zoom in here and

184
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,790
mostly we're going to be discussing 33

185
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,370
dot 401 and that is the specific version

186
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,730
that i use for this presentation this is

187
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,130
the primary LTE security architecture

188
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,130
document and you can for the most part

189
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,600
read the first 20 pages without much

190
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,680
difficulty and that's

191
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,710
where the most important portion is so

192
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,190
you know give it a quick look it's

193
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,430
really confusing to to to download these

194
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,420
standards FYI they're going to be

195
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,270
downloaded in a's a zip file and that's

196
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,070
the only way answer then double click on

197
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,630
that and then open it up it's super

198
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,760
awful so just FYI with some instructions

199
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,860
so here's the big picture in case you

200
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,660
you like really haven't looked at

201
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,230
cellular networks before so mobile

202
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,930
devices connect to a base station which

203
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,470
is those giant and and and antennas in

204
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,140
the sky which connects to a core network

205
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,589
which is basically run by verizon AT&T

206
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,020
sprint which then you know connects to

207
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,839
the internet or or other cellular

208
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,980
networks or or the the public switched

209
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,279
telephone network the portion between

210
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,500
just the base stations is called the

211
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,589
radio access network the iran and you're

212
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,910
going to see that term kind of be

213
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,650
evolved there is a G ran a you Tran and

214
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,310
EU Tran and so r and you know just just

215
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,260
just be be aware of that that is a a

216
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,430
collection of basically base stations as

217
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,260
we said base stations are permanent

218
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,529
cellular sites often times they are

219
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,610
disguised which is kind of funny when

220
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,440
you find one of one of those they

221
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,370
sometimes look like rocks or like they

222
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,080
like put trees around them so you don't

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,360
really know that they're there sometimes

224
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,520
they can you know run off of gas like

225
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,560
gasoline if they're like like way high

226
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,520
up in the the the mountains it's just

227
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,100
you know interesting when you when you

228
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,800
come across one next time you do take

229
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,690
you know take a look and just you know

230
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,360
look at the different types of locks and

231
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,610
just be aware so base stations sometimes

232
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,839
co-locate different carriers on the same

233
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,600
base station so you might have 80 AT&T

234
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
buying time from Sprint or a buying time

235
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,610
or space from

236
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,700
of verizon so a base station doesn't

237
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,010
necessarily have to be just one one

238
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,470
company and base stations are often well

239
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,540
base stations are connected back to the

240
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,029
the core network via a link called the

241
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,250
backhaul kind of pointed to it there and

242
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,440
that backhaul interface sometimes is a

243
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
fiber sometimes it's satellite sometimes

244
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,279
it's microwave it all depends on what

245
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,630
sorry most definitely t1 yep it's it's

246
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,790
basically however we can get the

247
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,200
information from the base station back

248
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,130
to the core network mobile devices your

249
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,640
your typical mobile device and whenever

250
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,589
someone talks about mobile devices they

251
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,300
want to take out there a phone and show

252
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,070
you right and I really want to right now

253
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,540
for some reason I know you all know what

254
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,680
a freaking phone looks like so my my

255
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,870
mobile device has anywhere from like

256
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,220
four to six different radios in it you

257
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,120
know Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth you know

258
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
possibly a bunch of different cellular

259
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,360
radios and so just just kind of be be

260
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,029
aware of that um in in LTE terms bless

261
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:22,100
you a phone is called a ue a user

262
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,779
equipment and this this user equipment

263
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,519
has a a UIC see which is often thought

264
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,250
of as a semi am a sim card this this

265
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,440
this a UICC is actually running an

266
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
application on top of it called the the

267
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,760
the the you sim and so that's just sort

268
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,980
of a big difference from a couple years

269
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,329
back sim and um are kind of used

270
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,190
interchangeably but they are very very

271
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,209
different nowadays subscriber identity

272
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,589
MC you've probably heard this when

273
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,360
you're basically hearing about stingrays

274
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,320
or you know MC catchers MC is basically

275
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,649
you're on the cellular network it is

276
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,690
your personal identity it defines who

277
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,680
you are it is a 15 digit number

278
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
stored on the the sim card or you sim

279
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,370
card whatever it consists of three of

280
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,339
values mcc MNC msi n we'll take a look

281
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:30,029
at that in a moment a lot of times

282
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,850
carriers try not to send the mcs over

283
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,110
the over the air if they don't if they

284
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,540
don't have to and so they'll use a

285
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,410
temporary identity called a guti I don't

286
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,459
know if that's how it's said that's how

287
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,510
I say it in my head a globally unique

288
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,180
uuue identity or a Tim see again I'm not

289
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,830
sure if that's how it's said temporary

290
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,120
mobile subscriber identity and these are

291
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,380
all different from your actual phone

292
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,730
number right your actual msisdn this is

293
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,770
what an AMC looks like and how its kind

294
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,410
of broken up it's just interesting to

295
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,890
note that a Europe may use a two digit

296
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,899
value for the second thing there for the

297
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,520
the second range yeah this is what the

298
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,070
you know just this is what all the fuss

299
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,290
is about hum but I have anyway so ue

300
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,959
identity your actual phone has its own

301
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:30,130
identity called the actual imei the

302
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,089
International Mobile Equipment Identity

303
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,790
it is a 16-digit number you can actually

304
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,580
look at it right now by doing pound hash

305
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,400
06 hash on your phone and it'll it'll

306
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,209
probably pop right up for our our sorry

307
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,810
sorry star hash 06 hash my bad don't

308
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,050
want to confuse our British friends and

309
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,990
the actual imei is often used most often

310
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,260
used to to blacklist phones from a

311
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,650
cellular network so so if someone steals

312
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,400
your phone they can blacklist AT&T can

313
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,500
can can blacklist that phone from

314
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,160
getting on their network it is um it is

315
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,890
illegal to change a phone's IMEI and

316
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,650
many in many countries for that reason I

317
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,150
don't know about our country you sim

318
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,970
cards these are basically and if if what

319
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,160
if what I read is true this is the

320
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,260
single most popular smart card and the

321
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,940
whole were

322
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,190
old / 7 over 7 billion in circulation

323
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,899
they actually store cryptographic keys I

324
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,669
mean that's their primary duty here

325
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:39,929
right is they are long-term

326
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,679
cryptographic key storage in a secure

327
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,340
area they do house a processor that

328
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,750
actually runs an operating system and

329
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,090
and on on top of this operating system

330
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,809
there is a stripped stripped-down mobile

331
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,840
mobile version of the the Java Virtual

332
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,519
Machine that is used and and and and it

333
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,409
can actually run apps like you can run

334
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,899
games off your s ehre your sim card

335
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,720
which is kind of cool and will totally

336
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,870
not be misused by anyone ever yeah and

337
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,460
like we were sent here sims are

338
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,529
deprecated the modern term is used sim

339
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,490
so you may remember cdma did so

340
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,610
basically a verizon used a soft sim they

341
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,710
have now basically you know made this

342
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,960
huge change in their a network and they

343
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,559
are now using a you know hard Sims now

344
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,750
and Sprint is changing from my mac

345
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,759
stealthy already went over that here's

346
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,470
what the sim card looks like there are a

347
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,419
bunch of different types right um we're

348
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,460
really just removing plastic for them

349
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,279
for the most part here in this picture

350
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,220
the the the yeah remove plastic I don't

351
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,860
know what that means um so the actual

352
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,590
metal part is more or less the same the

353
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,179
contacts are a little bit different oh I

354
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:08,159
Sims if you if you roll in Android you

355
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,809
are probably using a micro sim if you

356
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,029
roll and iPhone you're probably using a

357
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,549
nano-sim makes it real hard to go back

358
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,240
and forth so LTE networking here's

359
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,620
here's what we're really here for

360
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,309
remember it's a 4G data and voice tech

361
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:25,470
technology it's basically split into

362
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,769
three different portions any LTE network

363
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:30,690
the actual radio network which is called

364
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:36,240
the ve yu Tran I don't want to try and

365
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,009
go for that giant acronym the actual

366
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,759
core network the the evolved packet core

367
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,210
and the the

368
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,940
the IP multi multimedia subsystem we're

369
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,830
not going to talk about the IMS because

370
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,600
it's kind of confusing and we don't have

371
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,149
enough time here and if anyone has any

372
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,230
questions you know stop me let me know

373
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,929
so we're we are really going to focus on

374
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,640
the interaction between the the actual

375
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,279
phone and a base station I know this

376
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,529
looks awful and horrible let's talk

377
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,270
about it for a moment and then we'll go

378
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,950
into a nice pretty picture I promise

379
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,480
okay so the actual ue is the LTE device

380
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,039
in LTE parlance base stations are called

381
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,419
evolved node bees which is an awful name

382
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,510
so i know'd bees or eaten bees you will

383
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,740
see it written three or four different

384
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,360
different ways just just just know

385
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,740
anything with a be on the end it's

386
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,380
probably a base station that's just you

387
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,350
know so the the mobility management

388
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,289
entity Mme this is a really important

389
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:43,299
box on the core network it is it is a

390
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:47,380
server that is um that is basically

391
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,570
doing all of the authentication

392
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,760
functions and all of the Kindle like all

393
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,890
the different control signaling allowing

394
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,169
you on the the network saying you know

395
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,390
you can go here can't go there the

396
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,620
serving the serving gateway is the it's

397
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,070
it's basically the main route that user

398
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,140
data passes through it's just it's just

399
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,190
another server on the network it does do

400
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,000
handoff between other 3gpp networks and

401
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,500
so if you're going from AT&T LTE to

402
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,169
verizon LTE then if if there was a

403
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:25,090
handoff that had to be done because

404
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,190
you're going down a highway at 60 miles

405
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,659
an hour and you have to switch from this

406
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,880
from this base station to this base

407
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,820
station then that actual handoff would

408
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,429
would occur at the SD as the serving

409
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,669
gateway the the packet gateway the p

410
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,159
gateway allocates IP addresses and so

411
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,710
yeah all your phones have have nice IP

412
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,980
addresses now that none now that you're

413
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,000
on LTE the p gateway does handoff

414
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,820
between LTE oh sorry between 3gpp

415
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,070
networks and non 3gpp network

416
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,169
so if you were trimmed like if you were

417
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:03,190
handing off from AT&T LTE to verizon

418
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,460
cdma then that actual handoff would

419
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,100
occur from from the P gateway the home

420
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,169
subscriber server and the authentication

421
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:13,630
center the difference between these are

422
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,659
very minut I don't even talk about it I

423
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:17,769
just kind of mentioned them in the same

424
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,490
thing they actually reside on the the

425
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,669
enemy and they they actually hold your

426
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,399
long term cryptographic key k well we'll

427
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:30,580
get into that and the actual MC and then

428
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,860
I ms which is kind of confusing we're

429
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,259
not going to talk about that so here you

430
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,929
can see we have the the phone and

431
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:39,309
through some awesome lightning bolt

432
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:41,889
graphic there it goes to the the base

433
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:44,500
station from the the base station

434
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,470
control signaling is routed from the

435
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,649
base station to the enemy and as like

436
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:51,610
this is where all your all your

437
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,649
authentication information is stored at

438
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,750
and the serving gateway is where all

439
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,889
your user data is is put through and so

440
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:01,570
from here we would go out to the

441
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,029
internet or the the PSTN and this is

442
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:09,850
just a really basic LTE network was not

443
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,250
really mini you know there's not much to

444
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,240
know here which is which is nice right

445
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,259
so for communication between the phone

446
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,190
and the and the and the e node B and

447
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,019
then the core there are there are

448
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,509
cellular specific protocols as you might

449
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:31,149
as you might as you might imagine it

450
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:32,980
it's it's a cellular version of tcp/ip

451
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,789
right and in reality tcp/ip actually is

452
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,240
no runs on on top of all of all of this

453
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,149
which is which is which is nice um so

454
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:44,200
we're going to we're going to take a

455
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,299
look at some of these protocols here

456
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,950
let's zoom in on the far left side so

457
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,320
LTE uses different communica munications

458
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,389
planes prime primarily you should just

459
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:59,320
think of three you have a communica

460
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,559
munications plane for user data my phone

461
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,139
to the base station to the court to the

462
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,970
core to the core network that could be

463
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,250
voice or whatever you're looking at

464
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,880
there is control

465
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,610
signaling between your phone and the

466
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,370
base station right because the base

467
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,140
station has to know where your your

468
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,330
phone is it has they get tracking area

469
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,760
updates it has to you know do all that

470
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,880
authentication it has to say hey you're

471
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,800
being a little bit loud simmer down

472
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,490
right um and you know there's actual

473
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,560
control signaling for that and then

474
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,390
there has to be control signaling from

475
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,280
your phone to the core network and so

476
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,610
there's that's basically three distinct

477
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:49,040
planes here cool uh so we're going to

478
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,540
look at for a moment these three bottom

479
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,050
these three bottom ones so our RC

480
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,550
basically provides control signaling

481
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,190
between the phone and the e node B the

482
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,680
PDC p protocol packet data convergence

483
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,520
protocol does encryption and and it

484
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,820
actually gets like a it basically takes

485
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,830
all these the signaling above it and

486
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,690
then encapsulate sand then frankly just

487
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,230
you know encrypts it or or or integrity

488
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:24,890
protects it the the the RLC it actually

489
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,570
readies readies packets to be

490
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,580
transferred over the air interface and

491
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,830
then the actual Mac layer does

492
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,630
multiplexing and quality of service and

493
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,310
then physical you actually have you know

494
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,640
electronic bless you electronic

495
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,080
transmissions you know gallivanting over

496
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,920
the airwaves so here are the control

497
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,410
protocols and and and a lot of these

498
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,110
protocols are sort of repeated here and

499
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,730
that's and that's fine it's just how the

500
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,760
standards documents explain it so you

501
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,250
have the the control protocols which is

502
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,520
an ass security which is the which is a

503
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,610
non access stratum super confusing name

504
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,000
it connects you're like this is that a

505
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,160
control signaling plane from your phone

506
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,770
back to the core network and then you

507
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,720
see our RC there which is control

508
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,700
signaling from your phone to the actual

509
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,280
base station and then simply simplified

510
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,830
much more is where is what your your

511
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,980
data would would traverses

512
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,090
these four protocols here interfaces

513
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,850
that nice diagram that we had earlier

514
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,190
every single thing like every single

515
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,110
interface every single connection

516
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,210
between between a server or a network

517
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,470
component has its own unique identifier

518
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,330
basically and here are the main ones

519
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,179
that I want you to know for LTE so in

520
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,679
requirements will say things like the

521
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,350
actual yeah it'll say the x2 interface

522
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,080
which is between between two base

523
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,210
stations the x2 interface has to you

524
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,850
know has to have this much encryption or

525
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,370
you know has to be protected by these by

526
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,860
these means and so what you really need

527
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,270
to pay attention to is what's going to

528
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,460
confuse you is the is the s-1 interface

529
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,549
has to has two separate interfaces I

530
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:19,870
don't want it they just didn't call them

531
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,559
two different s 1 and s 2 so the actual

532
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,419
s 1 mm II is the the control plane

533
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,190
signaling interface and then the s1 you

534
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,290
is the user plane inner is the user

535
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,250
plane information in an interface

536
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,679
security what we're all here for so

537
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,410
there are a couple of different security

538
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,890
mechanisms in use here the actual um

539
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,460
token right the actual hardware token

540
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,410
authentication and key agreement which

541
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,929
is how your phone gets gets

542
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,730
authenticated onto the the the network

543
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,220
and that's really what what what a lot

544
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,919
of um a lot of people that say black hat

545
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,809
and DEF CON have been you know breaking

546
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,150
over over years passed and then we have

547
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,080
crypto LTE you know has its own like

548
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,610
basically has its own encryption and

549
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,080
integrity cryptographic algorithms so

550
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,169
we're gonna talk a little bit about that

551
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,760
high level threats to LTE there is a

552
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,830
document and it's one of those TRS and

553
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,419
you should probably go take a look at it

554
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,190
and just just sort of talks about stuff

555
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,010
we are worried about it was the the LTE

556
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,530
designers and so these are some of the

557
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,130
things here right tracking tracking

558
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,900
identity physical physical attacks on

559
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,929
base stations manipulating country

560
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:42,700
plain or user plane data threats to like

561
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,039
basically how there are like downgrade

562
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,320
attacks in SSL there are you know

563
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,809
downgrade attacks exist in cellular

564
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:52,240
networks as well Tino push you into

565
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,730
using a week or cipher and then you know

566
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,820
jamming it is you know an open an open

567
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,279
interface and so on it's interesting to

568
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,409
note that jamming is not within the

569
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:06,039
threat model of LTE and you can you can

570
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,119
basically acquire jammers for like 40 40

571
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:12,850
bucks on ebay from you know they'll have

572
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,299
some Russian characters on the packages

573
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,190
but uh yeah so it's just interesting to

574
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,990
know that they are not trying to prove

575
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,909
protect against this and mentally it's a

576
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:25,539
really hard hard hard problem so low

577
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,149
level threats right i mean basically

578
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,960
since it is open there is a sorry

579
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,139
because the the air interface is open

580
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,090
there are um like you can basically

581
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,309
sniff the the traffic possibly or do

582
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,369
jamming attacks sim cloning this used to

583
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:44,950
be a way bigger problem where you would

584
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,749
either steal someone's phone and copy

585
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:48,309
their sim their sim card and then

586
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:51,999
basically use their their their account

587
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,419
to make long-distance phone calls right

588
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,059
and nowadays more of an issue is really

589
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,049
people people cloning their their their

590
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,889
own phone and then and then using like

591
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,480
using using that to spread out their

592
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,279
wireless service to multiple to multiple

593
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,690
people basically have want to have one

594
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,490
accountant you know ten different 10

595
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,779
different 10 different lines basically

596
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,899
right and I really even that I like even

597
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,100
that I don't leave it like I don't see

598
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,929
that much of that happening threats to a

599
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,230
privacy by design I mean your phone

600
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,850
knows where you are at all times or at

601
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,139
the very at the very least if you are

602
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,529
like your relation like your location in

603
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,299
relation to a base station right i mean

604
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,309
if if your phone can talk to a base

605
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,200
station you're within some minimum some

606
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,690
minimum distance between a unique base

607
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,210
station and as we're saying now like

608
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,539
basically sprint and AT&T and Verizon

609
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:48,879
they have to operate this massive IP

610
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,619
based network now with you know

611
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:51,590
basically servers all

612
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,659
on the internet that's going to be a

613
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:55,159
little bit a little bit different from

614
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,179
from from before so the actual hardware

615
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:03,200
token you sim UICC it is more or less

616
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,320
identical to what it was in um TS which

617
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
is 33 g it actually points to the same

618
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,770
standard so just as hey look that way it

619
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,340
uses an l sorry LTE uses a new hardware

620
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,049
protected 128-bit key called k and k is

621
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,380
just really really like really really

622
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,110
important you need to look into k um

623
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,679
basically all keys are derived from k

624
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,500
session Keys long term keys whatever and

625
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,970
K never leaves your phone ever k k is is

626
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,370
basically instantiated or sorry k is

627
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,340
derived or you know generated and then

628
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,500
it is basically stored in the core

629
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,440
network at the enemy and inside of a sim

630
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,350
card and other than that it is it is

631
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:58,700
never it is never released so um a at a

632
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,010
nice segue okay yeah so one of the main

633
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,840
points of this key k is for aka aka you

634
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,700
know authentication and key and key

635
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,500
agreement this is how subscribers are

636
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,630
authenticated to to a cellular network

637
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,679
so it's basically a crypt a

638
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,929
cryptographic protocol it's originally

639
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:21,590
specified and that standard previous

640
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,399
versions of of AKA did not do mutual

641
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,559
often often it off an authentication and

642
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,360
that's the big deal here is that is that

643
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
LTE actually ties the name of the

644
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,059
serving network so it ties the name of

645
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:37,640
basically verizon's network into the AKA

646
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,860
protocol and so you are actually

647
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,460
authenticating both sides you're yeah

648
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,960
yeah an aka again this is confusing

649
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,370
we'll just talk about it for a second of

650
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,760
a look at the diagram AKA uses

651
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,140
authentication vectors it's basically

652
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,260
the main primitive inside of a ka and

653
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,530
it's just a bunch of different a bunch

654
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,730
of different security parameters

655
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,030
uh there's a baby a bunch of them but

656
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,400
basically and an authentic

657
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,410
authentication vector consists of a

658
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,230
response and aut in I don't know how

659
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,840
people say that authentication out in a

660
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,530
nonce a random number and then a local a

661
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,060
session master key is how we will call

662
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,410
that and that is qasmi or k as me so

663
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,990
it's actually not too bad though this is

664
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,490
a simplified version it doesn't have any

665
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,220
of the of the error mechanism sink in

666
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,170
case things go wrong in it but basically

667
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,020
you have your phone with the with the UM

668
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,440
on the left and on the right you have

669
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,540
the core network which which has access

670
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,970
to the HSS and and often often an

671
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,010
authentication center you can see at the

672
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,040
top at the top left and top right both

673
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,710
sides have access to the M C and K and

674
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,830
so what really goes on is that your

675
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,290
phone sends either a temporary identity

676
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,690
or or the MC over over the air interface

677
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,480
to the core network that's the the top

678
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,610
thing there the second step is that the

679
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,449
enemy receives that information looks it

680
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,460
up and sins and sends that information

681
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,670
to the to the authentication center

682
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,820
cryptographic magic happens we're

683
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,239
basically on the the MC and K and the

684
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,370
serving network ID all basically

685
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,800
generate a couple of different cryptid

686
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,370
crypto cryptographic parameters

687
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,550
specifically these the the the reefs

688
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,520
priests response and the end the session

689
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,060
key and only that information sorry this

690
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,080
whole authentic authentic authentic

691
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,030
Asian vector is sent to to the enemy and

692
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,900
then only the the nonce and the and the

693
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,600
authentic often an authentication token

694
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,960
I still forget what what a what a what a

695
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,720
you t n stands for that is all sent to

696
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,490
your SIM card your SIM card does

697
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,130
basically a very very similar process as

698
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,560
what as what goes on here to to

699
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,000
basically generate a signed response and

700
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,370
that signed response is then sent over

701
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,200
to the enemy at the core network and if

702
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,540
this and at this and if this expected

703
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,590
response

704
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,150
is equivalent to the signed response

705
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,400
then someone is authenticated to the

706
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:48,190
network yes sir they definitely do so it

707
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,950
that uh so I'm just because I it's

708
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,860
confusing how networks are laid out but

709
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,590
but uh basically it's not it's not all

710
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,320
your eggs in one in one basket there are

711
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
there are yeah there are basically

712
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,270
multiple baskets I'm not exactly sure

713
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:09,400
how say you know AT&T lays out it's it's

714
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,070
a it's often often occasion centers but

715
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,460
I would assume this is a complete josh

716
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,500
assumption here that there is basically

717
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,990
you know maybe a North Carolina

718
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,890
authentication center and there's a

719
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,590
Washington DC and then there's a new New

720
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,470
Jersey I have no idea um I just don't

721
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,230
have access to that into to that

722
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,890
information but but basically yes if it

723
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,020
is all in one in one and one basket and

724
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,590
there's a leak

725
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,250
yeah yeah I've actually I've actually

726
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,960
wondered about that myself and this is

727
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,080
just a another Josh thought maybe they

728
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,860
are like maybe it was just because the

729
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,410
network was built in you know late late

730
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,200
late late 80s Early 90s and they used

731
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,390
symmetric crypto up up front or maybe

732
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,850
phones have to basically authenticate a

733
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,860
lot and you know asymmetric cryptos much

734
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,760
more sorry is you know not not very

735
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,960
efficient um again that's just like

736
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,790
that's just a guess on my part that's a

737
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,970
good observation um um so yeah that's

738
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,190
how that's how you know your phone gets

739
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,980
onto its network and earlier versions of

740
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,220
this are like they look basically

741
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,720
similar to this it's just some of the

742
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,910
the acronyms are different and that uh

743
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,810
that uh that s nid and that nonce might

744
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:46,710
not be there so we don't have time to go

745
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,119
over this i'm running a little bit slow

746
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,040
but there is this is the the

747
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,750
cryptographic operation that is that is

748
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,840
used to generate the the authentic

749
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,990
authentication vectors it is a

750
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,170
standardized algorithm but it but of the

751
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,140
3gpp standards don't say that you have

752
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,630
to actually use it because someone like

753
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,240
because verizon actually owns basically

754
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,740
your SIM card and they owned the core

755
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,990
network they can actually use we know

756
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,690
whatever key generation and key their

757
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,000
rate derivation algorithms they want to

758
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,560
because they on both sides and so as

759
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,330
long as it works with him then their

760
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,340
their their network it's not a big big

761
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,950
deal and this standardized algorithm is

762
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,080
french is called Mila Nagy I hope I'm

763
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,030
not hurting that you know hurting

764
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,790
someones ears real real bad and this is

765
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,980
what this is the actual um verification

766
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,350
I mainly made these diagrams because the

767
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,609
ones inside of these standards were

768
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:39,990
super ugly and these ones you can just

769
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,150
take and do whatever you want with with

770
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,930
them your yourself so yeah the power

771
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,900
point is all is all is completely

772
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,340
available so LTE crypto cryptographic

773
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,600
algorithms used for you used for

774
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,150
basically a conf conf confidentiality

775
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,600
and integrity protection this was

776
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,290
there's like a

777
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,300
like a long super fun history here right

778
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,620
like basically originally with gsm

779
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,830
networks trying to trying to remember

780
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,440
exactly how how it went it was going to

781
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,640
be 64 bits was how far the original like

782
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,590
how long the original GSN key was going

783
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,320
to be but then the West Germans were

784
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,390
really were really worried about the

785
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,490
East Germans and Britain's didn't trust

786
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,210
anyone's sorry anyone and it eventually

787
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,060
kind of got nerfed and the this the same

788
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,610
way des did and so it's a GSM had a 56

789
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,610
bit key basically with like eight eight

790
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,330
eight eight bits of padding but in LTE

791
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:47,220
we do have 128 bit and 256-bit keys and

792
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,410
these are these are fairly robust

793
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,640
algorithms they are standardized

794
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,410
algorithms you can go and look in and

795
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,390
see exactly how they are they are they

796
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,990
are being employed affined not how they

797
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,670
are implemented these are all open

798
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,730
standards basically have e EA which is

799
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,920
in you know encryption algorithm one and

800
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,650
then EIA which is you know integrity

801
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,990
algorithm one and they're a bit they're

802
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,260
both based on snow 3 3g which is a UMTS

803
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,710
algorithm and then the the US and you

804
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,600
know be me being from NIST and you know

805
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,500
our history with AES and all that the

806
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,580
u.s. uses like the u.s. basically got a

807
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,490
AES inside of the 3gpp standard so

808
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,950
basically you have e ee a 2 in E I a two

809
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,610
are basically a esnc CTR mode and then

810
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:41,250
you know AES cbc-mac and then China was

811
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,170
kind of perturbed about this and so they

812
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,210
decided that they that they that they

813
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,040
wanted their own corrupt you know their

814
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,540
own a girl gorillas meeeeee and so now

815
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,150
zouk is currently being standardized and

816
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,760
it should be to my knowledge it's not

817
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,350
implemented but that doesn't mean much

818
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,790
because i don't know i don't know

819
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,000
anything about LTE networks in china um

820
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,720
yeah so I just I just don't and if I did

821
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,110
that would probably not be safe so right

822
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:11,070
now most keys in LTE are 256 bits bits

823
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,420
long but unfortunately only one

824
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,470
like there's basically 128 bits of zeros

825
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,569
and a lot of them but that is being

826
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:24,390
quickly changed and you know everyone's

827
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,400
being proactive about that just you know

828
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,569
FYI so here's what I kind of promised

829
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:31,770
right we're going to dip into the

830
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,780
standards and I'm really going slow I

831
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,900
thought anyway um so these are the three

832
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,760
different standardized algorithms and

833
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,549
what it says here is that um is that a

834
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:44,460
es and snow 3g have to be sub sub

835
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,740
supported but zouk is you know you don't

836
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,690
actually have to support zouk which is

837
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,400
which is interesting i don't know if

838
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,589
that's going to change in the future if

839
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:58,230
you know basically verizon an 80 if a

840
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,480
verizon and AT&T will have to support a

841
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:09,180
chinese cipher sorry yeah it might be

842
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,020
built in right yeah so the key the key

843
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,079
hierarchy and LTE it's a little bit

844
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,329
confusing but um basically you have K

845
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:20,460
which again is only stored in core

846
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,470
network and Sam and you have ck and I k

847
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,770
which are basically derived from from k

848
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,230
and they are basically stored in in the

849
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,230
HSS and then the phone itself but then

850
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,549
you get into the actual meat of it with

851
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:36,780
kaz me and k a sm e and this is the this

852
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,510
is the the the local master key and so

853
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,950
basically all these other keys are

854
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,960
derived from Academy for the for the

855
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,990
most part and there's there's so many

856
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,150
it's crazy I should have put a picture

857
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,670
of what the the the standard looks like

858
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,440
it looks like the most confusing circuit

859
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,059
diagram you've ever seen if you're

860
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:56,700
looking at how up like it what the the

861
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,549
Kia hierarchy looks at looks like you

862
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:01,020
should actually go in and look at it it

863
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,910
is very very comical and what you're

864
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,710
what you what you see here is that you

865
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,000
have different keys for different

866
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
purposes which is great but then you

867
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,319
start to have different keys for

868
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,420
different protocols which is even cooler

869
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,140
you have KRR siento i'm just do if KR

870
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,380
zie end here and the KRC in encryption

871
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,640
here so you have a different key for

872
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
both encryption and and integrity and

873
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,829
you have the the same thing here for an

874
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:26,410
ass

875
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,030
the non access stratum control signaling

876
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,069
here's a sweet little chart I found

877
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,650
online and i reproved pro who produced

878
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,230
and I totally cited them but um I really

879
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,030
like this because it just shows all of

880
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,950
the different main keys and their

881
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,609
strengths real real fast so signaling

882
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:48,160
protection what it's actually encrypted

883
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,960
inside of LTE so as we were saying you

884
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,609
know different different community

885
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:56,410
communication paths have their own have

886
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,510
their own keys and a common claim and

887
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,940
this is what really perturbed me i will

888
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,930
say that word um is that a LTE is fully

889
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,670
encrypted I've seen this in like I

890
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,760
Triple E articles I've seen this on on

891
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,250
just like all all across the internet

892
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,280
and that may be true but it is not

893
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,710
mandated by the standards and so you're

894
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,630
basically you're putting your faith in

895
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,579
what AT&T and Verizon and Sprint do and

896
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:23,950
they may vary it like they may very well

897
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,619
encrypt everything I don't I don't know

898
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:32,289
I yet but uh just I just I just like to

899
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:33,849
you know say you know I camera this

900
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:35,799
point this point this point home and

901
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,390
this is just a cool little diagram shows

902
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,670
you know which Keys different different

903
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,220
different layers of the the protocol

904
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,380
stacker actually are actually protected

905
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,650
by so we talked about NASA security I'm

906
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,880
going to speed up a little bit we talked

907
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,799
about NASA circus security here being

908
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:54,010
the the signaling beats between of the

909
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,049
actual phone and the court the core the

910
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,260
core network and and so that's called

911
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,470
the non access stratum the green part is

912
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,640
called the actual access stratum and

913
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,900
they get protected with different with

914
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,220
different keys and then nds IP network

915
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:17,140
domain system and / IP this is basically

916
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,210
using IPSec in the court in the core the

917
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,829
core network that's the standard if you

918
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:22,329
want to read up on it that's like a five

919
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:24,819
page standard it basically says you can

920
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:27,700
use IPSec in a certain in a certain mode

921
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,920
and then you can put security gateways

922
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,180
which are just basically hardware

923
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,819
hardware ipsec appliances on your your

924
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,950
network of various points

925
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,849
and this is not required either but to

926
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,869
prove that here we go so NASA

927
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:49,270
requirements so you see Nass signaling

928
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,690
confidentiality is an operator option so

929
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:56,230
the control signaling is fairly

930
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,730
important i would have I would have at

931
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,990
least suspected that the that the

932
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,579
control signaling would have been would

933
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:04,329
have been encrypted and it says there

934
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:07,089
you know note one rrc and a signaling

935
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:08,320
confidentiality protection is

936
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,680
recommended and a big a big reason for

937
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,240
this might be is that 3gpp standards

938
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,339
have to be deployed worldwide right a

939
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,869
minute they have to work in all in all

940
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:18,880
countries and it all says such

941
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,119
situations rrc signaling confidentiality

942
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:28,720
is an operator option and yeah the only

943
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,030
thing that's really mandated here in

944
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,000
terms of cryptographic protection is in

945
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,240
is integrity so integrity protection and

946
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,010
replay protection shall be provided to

947
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,099
NASA IRC signaling which is interesting

948
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,680
and yeah yeah so basically you can think

949
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,880
of it as the minimum and confidentiality

950
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,290
protection it and and there is there is

951
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,589
a caveat that says that if you

952
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:57,060
physically like if you don't physically

953
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,369
protect your network devices then then

954
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:03,520
you have to encrypt I haven't found much

955
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
about what physically protecting your

956
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,140
network devices means but if you want to

957
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,990
go look at these these are the the like

958
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,180
this is the standard and where you can

959
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,579
find it before I wrap up home homie node

960
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:20,380
B's I just wanted to let you guys know

961
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,609
that these things exist that these are

962
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:24,960
basically femtocells or or a doe cells

963
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,369
like these are just basically base

964
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:31,900
stations in your your your your house MC

965
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,780
MC catchers are typically some sort of

966
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,290
femme toast femtocell what's interesting

967
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,900
about the actual homie node b standard

968
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,869
is that it says that uh that like that

969
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,940
you have to have roots of trust and so

970
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,290
basically you have to have you know like

971
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,970
long-term cryptographic key storage

972
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,520
protected by a hardware on

973
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,250
as part of the home Nov no duh be and

974
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,860
that secure boot must be done which is

975
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,800
which is really really great yeah it's

976
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,660
just interesting and then lawful

977
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,250
interception just wanted to put this out

978
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,230
there too I haven't fully investigated

979
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,030
this yet but there are three different

980
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,860
lawful interception standards that I'm

981
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,990
aware of they're actually built into the

982
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,150
the LTE standard sends basically as you

983
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,340
can imagine so you know law law law

984
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,690
enforcement bodies can you know get

985
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,090
access to the the keys that were that

986
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,190
were used to come to to encrypt

987
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,520
someone's traffic hopefully this is

988
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,470
being this is being done to UM to make

989
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,190
it so it's it's it's done in the most

990
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,040
secure way as possible one would hope

991
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,350
that like you wouldn't want lawful

992
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,060
interception to basically make it to

993
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,600
where it was really you know like the

994
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,720
rest of the key structure was weak or or

995
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,590
you know reduce the size of a a key so

996
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,770
that's basically all I got LTE security

997
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,090
is imperfect and crazy complicated and

998
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,440
complicated things are all like always

999
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,150
really really secure right so uh in

1000
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,460
general integrity and replay protection

1001
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,200
are mandated not confidentiality

1002
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,770
protection and just remember remember

1003
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,480
that standards provide the bare minimum

1004
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,670
level of security that must be achieved

1005
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:22,960
um telcos may voluntary may Valen Valen

1006
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,590
tara lee raise the their security it's

1007
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,130
hard to tell so thanks for having me

1008
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:32,380
here's some further reading if you want

1009
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,510
go to open security training got info

1010
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,820
and i just tweeted these slides with the

1011
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,960
with the b-sides CL CL CL t hashtag if

1012
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,070
you want to take a look take a look at

1013
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,730
them so thanks
