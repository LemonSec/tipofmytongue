1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,670
testing testing okay sorry about that

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:11,219
anyway several elements of their talk I

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,679
think you'll find salient in here I hope

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,970
so I just give you a little bit about me

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,480
been an IT for about 21 years now so my

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,430
IT experience can officially drink

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,779
alcohol the last ten really have been an

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,490
infosec I would make an argument that it

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,980
was actually longer than that but not

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,260
really worth arguing focusing especially

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,710
in identity and access management

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,510
currently I'm the lead I am I say

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,219
evangelist I'll tell you why in a second

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,719
it's kind of a wishy-washy name but

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,760
there's a reason behind it for a fortune

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,760
100 pharma company you look me up on

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,980
LinkedIn you'll figure out who but I'm

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,390
also a volunteer high school speech and

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,430
debate coach don't read anything into

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,110
that that offers no warranty or

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,649
guarantee of my performance and of

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,480
course related to my company the

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,340
opinions expressed here or entirely my

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,970
own but the reason I call it an

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,729
evangelist is you know my job for my

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,490
company is to craft the strategy with an

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,590
identity and access management but it's

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
also to hopefully make people at my

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,710
company care about identity and access

30
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,840
management and hopefully by the end of

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,220
this presentation you'll be carrying as

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,729
well so a funny thing happened on the

33
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,159
way to this presentation I was sitting

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,140
in allen hicks keynote speech this

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,479
morning on data privacy when I receive a

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,960
text alert from bank of america my debit

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,270
card has been compromised funny you

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,790
should say that because that's the first

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,979
thing I thought was oh that's ironic

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,009
then I realized no it isn't it's a funny

41
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,710
coincidence but it wasn't ironic so

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,570
anyway I just thought i would share that

43
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,070
because i realized on my way out to the

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,290
car before i spent 30 minutes talking to

45
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,390
bank of america about it they found my

46
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,310
number on somebody's computer they don't

47
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,420
even know who the merchant is yet

48
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,469
because I haven't pulled my business

49
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,659
from them yet but you know they lock

50
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,250
down the car to everything's cool you

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,680
know but you know it it was certainly a

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,250
fitting a segue to and also give me an

53
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,250
introduction to this story so

54
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,550
so we're going to talk about what Pam is

55
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,430
why it's necessary talk about some

56
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,440
recent events and certainly the Gotham

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,210
guys have really done a nice job of

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,280
setting some of that I'm going to dive

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,350
into a little bit of some of the key

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,300
breaches related to privileged access

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,990
and then we'll talk about Pam as a

62
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,880
program or a service we'll talk about

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,220
things like the actual practice of

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,260
privileged access management and it's a

65
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,230
very broad term how collaboration is

66
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,210
critical within that area and then we'll

67
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,100
look through some use cases and then

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,780
finally we'll look at how do you adopt a

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,610
pan program and some of the keys to

70
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,480
success so first what is Pam it's not

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,870
that that's my blunt attempt at a joke

72
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,290
during most of this so privileged access

73
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,140
management is a broad spectrum sometimes

74
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,880
that term is interchange with privileged

75
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,890
identity management or privileged

76
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,900
account management I like privileged

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,520
access management because it's a little

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,530
bit more holistic and especially as a

79
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,410
practitioner depending upon the size of

80
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,360
the company that you're in you may look

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
at different opportunities within that

82
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,440
spectrum to leverage privileged access

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,750
management that may not necessarily rely

84
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,250
on tooling and I'll talk a little bit

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,860
more about that later but I'm not going

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,790
to read you guys these definitions

87
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,010
because I gotta slide full of you know

88
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,990
but basically we're looking at three

89
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,490
components to this privileged access

90
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,340
which is the elevated condition within a

91
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,660
system that lets you do the cool things

92
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,520
on a system the privileged account

93
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,380
obviously is the enabler behind that and

94
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,510
then the use of privileged accounts

95
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,370
should absolutely be managed within your

96
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,160
organization and some consultants out

97
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,160
there I am NOT one of them will tell you

98
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,930
that really when you're doing identity

99
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,100
management you should wait a while

100
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,810
before you start tackling privileged

101
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,150
accounts as the Gotham data security

102
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,990
guys you know Sciences sorry explained

103
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,990
you should be doing it now and it

104
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,580
doesn't mean that you have to boil the

105
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,950
ocean and try and do everything but you

106
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,880
should be trying to manage those

107
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,339
accounts today and just to give you an

108
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,100
example from a personal perspective how

109
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,418
many of you have a network router at

110
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,360
home hopefully everybody probably raises

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,830
their hand

112
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,229
if you have a computer with an admin

113
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,849
account at home you now have the

114
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,680
authority to have a privileged access

115
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,900
management program at home just managing

116
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,129
to account so you probably have a

117
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,530
password management tool right you log

118
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,849
those two accounts you get rid of the

119
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,199
default password you now have a

120
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,539
privileged access management program you

121
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,759
multiply that times 95,000 workstations

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,110
that's a little bit of a different you

123
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,479
know endeavor but the point being is

124
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,939
that you can start simple with this and

125
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,180
I'll reiterate that as we go on the

126
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,099
reason why this is so important in

127
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,349
Gotham obviously demonstrated some of it

128
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:01,270
is we've seen a bit of a shift in the

129
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,129
use of the Internet you know with bring

130
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,620
your own devices in consumerization of

131
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,949
IT our strategy for security is changing

132
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:12,909
you know we're moving into a new world

133
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:15,590
the old world was you build a perimeter

134
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,020
defense you get a really great firewall

135
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,460
you throw in some nice intrusion

136
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,120
detection and prevention and you know

137
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,529
antivirus and whatnot you're good to go

138
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,330
right most of the people in this room

139
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,879
probably say no and here's the reason

140
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,710
why is that's really what your

141
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,180
environment looks like you know what

142
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll say with respect to that is you

143
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,370
know especially with you know mobility

144
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,169
and bring your own device and things of

145
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,960
that nature the business whether it's

146
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,969
your customers whether its internal

147
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:50,240
customers whether its users they're all

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,089
asking for access from everywhere so

149
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,650
that means that you're having more rules

150
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,479
come in through those firewalls you're

151
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,580
getting less promiscuous in terms of

152
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,259
your intrusion detection in your IPS

153
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,029
systems in terms of what you're willing

154
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,259
to detect because a lot of them would

155
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,000
show up as false positives or you're

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,349
having to refine those rules become a

157
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,020
lot more or less fuzzies so to speak and

158
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,080
that's the challenge that curtain

159
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,460
creates this and that's why we say

160
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,080
identity is the new perimeter I did not

161
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,080
invite thats it create that invent that

162
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,440
saying I apologize but I certainly find

163
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,589
it appropriate so what we're going to

164
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:27,229
take a look at and I'll go through only

165
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:28,729
a few of these some of them will hit

166
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,560
closer to home than others small

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
breaches examples of how they tie into

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,270
privileged access management and and

169
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,560
hopefully what we can do moving forward

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,750
this probably resonates with a lot

171
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,100
people in this room because I suspect a

172
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,450
few of you may live in South Carolina

173
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,040
I'm not going to go into great detail

174
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,140
about what took place in that breach the

175
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,670
only thing I'll highlight is one of the

176
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,010
things that they identified in that

177
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,200
breach you know it was an apt type

178
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,330
attack where they SAT there and they

179
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,890
were promiscuous on the network looking

180
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,480
for accounts you know just like the

181
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,940
Gotham guys talked about they were

182
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,170
looking for those credentials that were

183
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,150
easy to find what did they find they

184
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,770
found something as simple as a backup

185
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,860
account its sole task was to back up

186
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,360
data on their respective systems and

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,500
most people would look at that and go

188
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,360
that's not really a privileged account

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,230
is it yeah it is it gave them access to

190
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,270
37 terabytes worth of gigabytes sorry

191
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,060
were 70 for two gigabytes worth of data

192
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,940
that contained the data of all of the

193
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,790
taxpayers in South Carolina that's all

194
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,070
that account was so that's one of the

195
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,270
things that you want to consider when

196
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,560
you're looking at well what are my

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,780
privileged accounts those are some of

198
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,010
the ones that you want to take a look at

199
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,090
and of course I have a little snarky

200
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,100
commentary at the end that you know in

201
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,050
exchange for the you know one of the

202
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,020
things that I thought was interesting

203
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,820
the gds guys talked about with respect

204
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,940
to the data breach investigation report

205
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,229
you know they estimated the cost of the

206
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,340
breach at one hundred eighty eight

207
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,110
dollars per person and that's a general

208
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,910
metric that's being used but what's the

209
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,710
cost to an individual who has their

210
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,200
identity stolen it's probably a little

211
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,250
higher than one hundred eighty eight

212
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,050
dollars that might buy you some you know

213
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,770
some identity theft service but you know

214
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,080
to be fair to the state of South

215
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,400
Carolina they're going to review whether

216
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,320
they're going to renew that service at

217
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,260
the end of the year but I you know

218
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,900
hopefully they'll let aside to take care

219
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,180
of their taxpayers Saudi Aramco is

220
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,180
another interesting example in the sense

221
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,680
that this is a different type of an

222
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,979
attack this was an insider attack and

223
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,100
the challenge Saudi Aramco had that a

224
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,049
lot of enterprises out there have is

225
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,299
when they build workstations they build

226
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,229
them all with the same admin password

227
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,309
somebody inside that company happen to

228
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,200
know what that password was guess what

229
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,570
they threw a Trojan on there and was

230
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,690
able to wipe out the disk drives of

231
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,709
30,000 pcs it's pretty disruptive you

232
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:52,130
know

233
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,230
wasn't as destructive as it was

234
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,580
originally believed they were able to

235
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,320
recover a lot of the data because it was

236
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,540
on servers as well but it was highly

237
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,230
disruptive to the workforce and so that

238
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,360
brings in the idea of you know as I

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,340
mentioned earlier in the talk you know

240
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,550
look at your local admin passwords you

241
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,440
know and especially with Linux

242
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,850
practitioners one of the things you want

243
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,610
to avoid is using your base account if

244
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,200
you're sending email with that account

245
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,490
you shouldn't be elevating the

246
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,080
permissions of that account to do things

247
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,790
you should be using other credentials to

248
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,500
do that and that's one of the things

249
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
that would frustrate a pen tester

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,950
because if I capture my email account

251
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,560
guess what he's going to be able to do

252
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,630
it's an email I don't have any privilege

253
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,370
to access at my company that's native to

254
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,350
my network account they're all tied to

255
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,520
privileged accounts that we have a

256
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,700
system that we use to manage that

257
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,810
another good example of that for example

258
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,900
is if you manage an active directory

259
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,300
forest at your company if you're using

260
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,010
your base network credentials that has

261
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,000
permissions as domain admin you really

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,380
need to consider segregating those

263
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,050
accounts because if somebody gets access

264
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,250
to that account which could be had

265
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,810
through a basic phishing attack and

266
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,580
phishing attacks are just getting a

267
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,590
little creepily good you know you can

268
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,090
compromise your entire network by doing

269
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,700
that and I promise I'm not going to

270
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,930
spend the entire talk trying to scare

271
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,890
you ebay obviously you know we're moving

272
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,290
into the more recent weeks ebay

273
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,640
obviously had a breach and that was an

274
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,810
example of what I just talked about

275
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,570
where they did spear phishing attack

276
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,430
very targeted they did not just send it

277
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,900
out to everybody because what happens

278
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,970
when you send it up to everybody oh this

279
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,190
is a phishing attack they sent it out to

280
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,710
very specific IT users which you would

281
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,240
hope would be more savvy but they can

282
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,820
get caught just like anybody else and

283
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,840
they were able to capture some

284
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,400
credentials credentials that had

285
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,780
privileged access and that's how they

286
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,250
were able to compromise those accounts

287
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,570
and who knows that may have been how

288
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,510
they got my credit card number so that's

289
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,220
just another example now the other thing

290
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,140
and this is a critique I have a vivir

291
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,480
ebay actually technically has two factor

292
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,130
authentication available but it's tied

293
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,920
to the paypal service not surprising

294
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,150
that they want you to do all your

295
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,560
transactions so they keep your money as

296
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,680
long as possible but they do have it but

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,690
they don't make it publicly available

298
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,390
in a fashion that would have if these

299
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,730
credentials were compromised would have

300
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,800
allowed you to keep moving forward but

301
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
that's kind of a separate talk about

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,850
two-factor authentication and then

303
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,100
finally I just thought this one was

304
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,490
amusing and you guys may have heard

305
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,890
about this these Canadian teenagers that

306
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,290
found an old ATM manual online which of

307
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,460
course the manual says this is the

308
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,490
default password and shock of shocks a

309
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,440
bank actually still had the default

310
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,310
password on some of their ATMs and you

311
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,650
know that just again you know this I

312
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,630
guarantee you if that was my bank and I

313
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,940
don't think it was because I don't think

314
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,330
bank of Americas in Canada but if that

315
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,680
was my bank I'd be pulling on money out

316
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,510
of there pretty quick so that's just a

317
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,270
bad operational practice and that's one

318
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,680
of the challenges that I'll talk about

319
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,510
with respect to the practice of

320
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,450
privileged access management is this has

321
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,520
to become part of your DNA this is not

322
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,200
because this is one of the struggles I

323
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,940
run into at my company we're rolling

324
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,640
this project out and they think it's oh

325
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,140
well I'll just get all my accounts on

326
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,090
there and I've done that isn't how it

327
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,220
works every time because you know okay

328
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,230
well you're right when are you rolling

329
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,730
out another server oh I've got 10 on

330
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,340
order for tomorrow okay all of those

331
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,050
servers need to be secured in manage see

332
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,160
it's got to become part of your

333
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,510
operational practice and I'll talk a

334
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,070
little bit more about that in a second

335
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,170
but what is what does all of this tell

336
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,850
us first of all as you guys will

337
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,470
probably agree the threat landscape is

338
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,480
changing daily one of the things you

339
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,370
know that has been noted is that the

340
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,290
compromise of privileged credentials and

341
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,380
obviously GDS commented on this as well

342
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,110
is a key stage in nearly all attacks and

343
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,640
that came from the cyber sheath or

344
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,930
fourth day they phrase it a little bit

345
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,520
differently but they walk through the

346
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,040
life cycle of an apt and elevation of

347
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,290
privilege is like the fifth stage in

348
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,670
that and that's ultimately what you're

349
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,020
trying to do with respect to privileged

350
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,730
access management and that's why I call

351
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,140
it access management as opposed to

352
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,670
identity management because you gain

353
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,430
access through a variety of methods you

354
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,080
know as I mentioned this is a critical

355
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,180
attack vector they've already mentioned

356
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,820
the verizon debe ir i definitely

357
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,110
recommend taking a look at it they

358
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,310
actually improved it concern

359
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,200
durably this year it was a little harder

360
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,900
to read in previous years and I think

361
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,510
they got some creative consultants to

362
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,279
really kind of jazz up and it's a lot

363
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,430
more readable now one of the things i

364
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,930
did find interesting and admittedly this

365
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,710
is from two years ago but a company

366
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,710
called cyber Ark whose one vendor in the

367
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,440
Panama space did a survey and they found

368
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,589
that forty-three percent of respondents

369
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,720
either didn't have a pen practice or

370
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,779
they weren't sure if they did which I

371
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:51,620
thought that was interesting if you

372
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,900
don't know if you have a pan practice

373
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,520
and these were like directors of IT that

374
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,390
were responding and reevaluate their job

375
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,690
role so let's talk about the practice of

376
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,620
privileged access management and like I

377
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,690
said a little bit earlier you can run

378
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,060
the spectrum of how you're doing this at

379
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,370
a smaller company the idea of going out

380
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,650
and buying an expensive product to vault

381
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,720
all your passwords may not be practical

382
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,839
and that's one of the reasons why i call

383
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,900
it the practice of pam because you can

384
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,210
do other things to introduce controls

385
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,060
that aren't real expensive typically

386
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,980
there's manpower which that may be an

387
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,630
issue by itself but you know that's

388
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,070
something you have to manage but

389
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,290
ultimately pam as a practice is designed

390
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,110
to answer basic questions who has this

391
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,330
elevated access to a system when was it

392
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,940
used where was it used from this is

393
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,070
especially useful for companies that

394
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,040
offshore or outsource some of their IT

395
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,920
services which is a very common practice

396
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
you may want to limit the use of that

397
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,280
account only to that organization and so

398
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,830
as part of your controls around that

399
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,900
account you may ensure that those users

400
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,400
are the only people that have access to

401
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,800
that credential and then finally what

402
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,089
was actually done and that's what we

403
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,589
call session logging and I'll talk a

404
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:07,850
little bit more about that when we get

405
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,070
to the use cases the other thing i want

406
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,350
to emphasize and this are a little bit

407
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,440
earlier the technology or the tooling is

408
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,990
only one part of the equation you know

409
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,050
as justin mentioned in the the pen

410
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,180
testing talk you know one of the things

411
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,100
that they're constantly doing is looking

412
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,620
through those nmap logs and adding the

413
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,010
human intelligence to how they're using

414
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,750
those services within that particular

415
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,250
work and that's exactly what a hacker is

416
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,770
going to do so within your enterprise

417
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,510
how you use those accounts are going to

418
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,160
vary and as a result the controls that

419
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,570
you introduce are going to vary as well

420
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,090
and also take into consideration the

421
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,880
fact that people are also part of that

422
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,860
process in fact I saw an article last

423
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,050
night that talked about the human factor

424
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,670
is the one that usually causes most

425
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,320
breaches Pam is most assuredly a

426
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,270
collaborative effort and some of that

427
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,350
may seem obvious because obviously

428
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,180
security has to work with the rest of IT

429
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,630
in the business to do that so while it

430
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,490
is self-evident how you interact with

431
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,430
them is important you know one of the

432
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,960
you know first you know the goal should

433
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,220
be to clean up all of your privileged

434
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,840
accounts but again trying to boil the

435
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,150
ocean can be a bit of a challenge the

436
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,950
other challenge is I got an email last

437
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,390
week that I appreciated his enthusiasm

438
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,620
but he basically asked me if I could

439
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,450
tell him all of the privileged accounts

440
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,280
that were in his division of the company

441
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,020
division had probably about fifteen

442
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,990
thousand users and probably about 800

443
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,770
systems and he was asking me if I could

444
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,089
tell him what all of his privileged

445
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,440
accounts for and you know I wind up

446
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
setting up a meeting with him to deliver

447
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,089
the bad news and that answer was no the

448
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,260
good news was there were other people in

449
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,520
his in his division that we're

450
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,050
collecting that information but one of

451
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,580
the key things that comes out of this is

452
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,849
this is not an IT service where like a

453
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,000
pen tester type service where i'm going

454
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,349
to be doing perimeter security and

455
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,670
seeing if you guys are doing what you're

456
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,910
doing what I'm enabling as a security

457
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,890
professional are controls that I need

458
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,680
you to use and I'm also going to work

459
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,699
with you in a collaborative fashion

460
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,439
because I don't know how you use a lot

461
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,390
of those accounts I don't know how you

462
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,680
use those systems I don't even know a

463
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,119
lot of the applications that you are

464
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,850
using so I'm darn sure not going to know

465
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,170
what the privileged accounts are in that

466
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,580
particular area because it could be at

467
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,230
the application layer it could be at the

468
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,600
web layer it could be at the OS layer it

469
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,970
can be at the hardware layer so an

470
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,590
article the other day this motherboard

471
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,620
manufacturer apparently stored their

472
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,080
default passwords in clear text and all

473
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,120
you had to do to find out what

474
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,710
password was especially if it was the

475
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,110
default password was scanned on this

476
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,640
particular port and pulled this object

477
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,530
and even if they had done the smart

478
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,690
thing and changed their password if this

479
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,920
motherboard hadn't been patched they

480
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,050
could very easily have had hardware

481
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,750
level access to a server and like i said

482
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,370
i think it was about 30,000 servers that

483
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,140
were potentially compromised by that so

484
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,000
like i said earlier you know one of the

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,280
keys with respect to this is to make

486
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,780
privileged access management part of

487
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,400
your security DNA and not just within

488
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
your security organization and that's

489
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,250
where you know i talked about the

490
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,880
evangelical piece most of my time at

491
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,650
work is actually spent talking to the

492
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,740
business and helping them understand how

493
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,240
important privileged access management

494
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,950
is how to enable it within your

495
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,900
organization I'll sit down with them

496
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,220
with a particular system let's take a

497
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,620
look at you know each layer within the

498
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,390
OSI model and potentially how they could

499
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,100
be at risk especially for some of the

500
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,490
more sensitive areas so let's take a

501
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,520
look at some of the use cases for Pam

502
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,480
and these are by no means exhaustive but

503
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,090
these are the two biggest ones that i

504
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,710
would encourage people to use especially

505
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,570
if they have the finances to afford the

506
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,570
tooling the first one looks at password

507
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,160
access and basically what i call this is

508
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,429
the vaulting use case and simply what it

509
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,920
is is you may have a system that you

510
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,460
cannot you know access or record you

511
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,120
know either the RDP or telnet or SSH you

512
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,260
can't record what happens with that

513
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,730
privileged account a good example is

514
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,740
like a web application where you may

515
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,809
have an admin login to the web app and

516
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,990
you can't record what they do ideally

517
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,460
and I think some of the vendors are

518
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,080
moving into this space they are

519
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,700
increasing the capabilities to do that

520
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,280
but let's assume that situation exists

521
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,630
and so this administrator of this

522
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,760
particular application logs into their

523
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,320
privileged access service and this is

524
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,120
designed to be generic there's no

525
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
product specific to this but they're

526
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,690
going to log into that privileged access

527
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,050
server they're going to discover okay I

528
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,600
have 15 accounts that I have access to

529
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,420
he's going to check out that account and

530
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,620
it's going to copy that password into

531
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,510
his keyboard buffer it can then go to

532
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,110
his website in

533
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,549
do what he needs to do from an

534
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,740
administrative function and then when he

535
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,270
closes out that application he goes back

536
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,620
into the Pam system and checks that

537
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,600
password back in what should happen in

538
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,000
that scenario is the Pam system will

539
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,950
then go out and change that password so

540
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,540
while he did have the password and his

541
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,429
keyboard buffer for a period of time

542
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:19,429
that password is no longer valid now you

543
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:20,720
have to be careful with that obviously

544
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
was like system type accounts because

545
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,230
you might wind up breaking something but

546
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,820
if it's specific to an admin user

547
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,530
account that's this is an effective way

548
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,630
of achieving some of those controls what

549
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm not crazy about what this one is you

550
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,809
can't really record what happens you can

551
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,070
look in the background with respect to

552
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,650
the logs but it requires a little bit

553
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,200
more effort the more elegant solution is

554
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,299
the one at the bottom related to session

555
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,480
access or session recording what happens

556
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,220
there like it says you're going to log

557
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,960
into the Pam system again let's say he's

558
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,220
going to you know administer an essay p

559
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,669
account on linux back end of a box he's

560
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:57,440
going to log into pam he's going to

561
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,150
select that system he's going to check

562
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,040
out that system which is going to

563
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,710
initialize in ssh session and that

564
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,600
session as soon as it's initialized

565
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,910
begins recording so you can have every

566
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,169
single keystroke that's taking place

567
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,330
within that system the system will then

568
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,520
record that session it will basically

569
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,890
archive it once it completes and ideally

570
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,270
you keep it for as long as you need to

571
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,490
to sustain regulatory requirements but

572
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,780
the great thing about that system is

573
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,820
it's fully auditable you can know

574
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,770
exactly what's taking place especially

575
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,150
if you're offshoring some of those

576
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,340
capabilities you can know exactly what

577
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,630
they're doing and this isn't necessarily

578
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,490
from a security perspective you also

579
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,870
might find some bad operational

580
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,730
practices about why how they're moving

581
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,220
data and things of that nature that

582
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,809
might assist you in improving up

583
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,549
operationally some of the other Pam use

584
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:49,490
cases that can exist one very common one

585
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,640
is script management and larger

586
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,000
enterprises or shoot even smaller ones

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,830
what happens frequently is you may have

588
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,169
a script that's designed to execute a

589
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:02,270
function and within that script

590
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,770
unfortunately is stored credentials that

591
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,630
probably have not been changed from the

592
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,200
time that they were created some of the

593
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,750
Pam tools out there and I won't name

594
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,410
because this is an offender

595
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,290
recommendation

596
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,360
some of the tools out there can actually

597
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,690
manage those credentials for you and how

598
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,240
they're executed and give you a lot more

599
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,340
control over that area the other thing

600
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,510
that you would typically do in that

601
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,680
script function area is lockdown who has

602
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,720
access to those scripts so again that's

603
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,330
another you know if you tilt the Pam

604
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,400
axis on its head you know that's another

605
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,840
control that you can put in place that

606
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,960
isn't necessarily related to tooling

607
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,510
I've already mentioned local workstation

608
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,710
admin management you know one of the

609
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,630
things that a lot of larger enterprises

610
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,310
are trying to do you know especially

611
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,470
with Windows 7 and Windows 8 is you can

612
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,690
yank local admin access from the users

613
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,130
and one of the things that you can do in

614
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,900
some cases this might be a little

615
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,670
expensive for smaller organizations is

616
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,620
you can put their local admin account on

617
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,080
the Pam tool and yeah if they need to

618
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,910
install software that's great you go to

619
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,380
this service you check out the account

620
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,240
you go in you do what you need to do and

621
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,250
then you come back and check it in and

622
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,630
it changes the password for you that's

623
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,220
another way of securing it Saudi Aramco

624
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,970
would love that service right now

625
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,160
another you know this is one that you

626
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,440
can almost do a talk by itself but with

627
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,720
the move to the cloud and this is a

628
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,130
challenge for some of the vendors in

629
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,930
this space is how do you manage

630
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,490
privileged accounts out in the cloud if

631
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,810
you don't necessarily have direct access

632
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,840
for them from your network there are

633
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,220
some vendors that are specializing in

634
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,500
this space so they might be worthy of

635
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,080
consideration you know in other use

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,210
cases virtualization platforms so it's

637
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,010
not just all of the virtual pcs or

638
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,540
virtual servers that you have on a host

639
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,330
you also have the root admin account on

640
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,520
the ESX devices or whatever

641
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,830
virtualization platform you're using and

642
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,320
as I mentioned at the bottom look at all

643
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,910
the hardware platforms you can look at

644
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,700
the the routers you know if you're a

645
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,620
manufacturing company you've got tons of

646
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,600
skated devices that are probably out

647
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
there a lot of them are still running

648
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,010
with their default passwords as well

649
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,570
hopefully they're air-gapped to prevent

650
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,000
problems but some of them may not be and

651
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,550
so you know like i said this list is not

652
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,020
meant to be exhaustive and one of the

653
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,100
things that i would encourage you to

654
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,140
look at if you are working with anybody

655
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,900
on the this initiative is you know get

656
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,220
creative in terms of where you think

657
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,539
those accounts and controls could be

658
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,070
so with respect to the adoption approach

659
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,679
it's broken out into two components one

660
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,929
is the pre engagement phase and this is

661
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,980
what we encourage I say we within my

662
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,159
operational duties what we try and do is

663
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,380
we try and deliver a lot of information

664
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,520
well crafted for the business owner or

665
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,650
the application owner so that they can

666
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,659
begin to gather that information on

667
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,400
their own so before they even start to

668
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,220
talk to us we may orient them with this

669
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,809
is what a privileged account kind of

670
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,190
looks like but it's a little bit of a

671
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,809
Jabberwock because it depending upon the

672
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:04,559
application it may look different so we

673
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,760
help them understand how you might look

674
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,059
for that do an inventory of those things

675
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,740
then do a prioritization because some of

676
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,029
the systems that you look at depending

677
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,980
upon the data that's being stored it may

678
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,450
not be critical to you right now to

679
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,789
secure that particular system but if

680
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,649
this contains the financial data of your

681
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,330
company that's probably going to be one

682
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,140
of the first ones in line you know if

683
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,419
there is documentation of current access

684
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,190
processes you certainly want to get that

685
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,649
what we have found is a lot of companies

686
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:35,610
the documentation what documentation so

687
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,899
you certainly want to encourage them to

688
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:39,750
do that when possible take that list of

689
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,220
candidate systems you begin to

690
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,100
prioritize them and then hopefully you

691
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,820
know if they already have existing

692
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,010
processes you know look at revising them

693
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,270
because this is the opportunity we're

694
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,399
now delivering the potential of tooling

695
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,480
in the instance where it's going to be

696
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,340
used how can we optimize some of those

697
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,990
processes so that's getting again back

698
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,340
to the idea that this isn't just about

699
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,320
hey we pushed a tool out you can use it

700
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
now and our secure there's an

701
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,980
opportunity to adjust those processes

702
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,809
that hopefully realizes some

703
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,309
efficiencies because one of the

704
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,659
challenges that you're going to get into

705
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,630
with adoption is if you just drop the

706
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,390
tool in and say use this it's going to

707
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,149
make their life harder how many IT

708
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:17,090
people want to make their life harder I

709
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,549
have yet to meet one the second phase is

710
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,419
the engagement our onboarding stage

711
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:26,279
that's where the security organization

712
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,080
will sit down with the customer tell you

713
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,429
take a look at the inventory and the

714
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,590
target systems set up a schedule for

715
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,350
deployment you know because there's a

716
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,899
good chance they manage a lot of

717
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:38,370
Independent Systems and then they'll

718
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,460
start in a test environment

719
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,419
you certainly don't want to throw this

720
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,730
into production because you will run the

721
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,590
risk of breaking systems if you if you

722
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,020
don't do it properly so you know

723
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,149
definitely when you're acquiring a Pam

724
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,970
tool set I would encourage you to

725
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,159
definitely create a test environment and

726
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,350
actually I what I encourage you to do is

727
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,409
don't put all of the dev test and

728
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,909
production systems in your production

729
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,700
environment put your tests and Devon

730
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,470
your test environment that way if what

731
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,330
you're breaking something in test people

732
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,679
don't tend to get is in as much of a

733
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,820
panic and then finally once you've done

734
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,080
all that testing there's a good chance

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,580
you may update some of your processes

736
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,750
based on your experience with the

737
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,830
tooling because this is going to be the

738
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,110
time that the customer is going to get a

739
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,510
chance to use those tools and they may

740
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,669
make some suggestions and you may fire

741
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:26,710
some suggestions back on how do you add

742
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,929
additional controls instead of maybe

743
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:32,020
using a particular tool or other

744
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,760
potential updates to the processes and

745
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,169
then finally you're going to deploy into

746
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,789
production that's when you're going to

747
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,710
get going to want to go into some type

748
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,210
of hyper care mode to make sure

749
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,049
everything's running as you expect so

750
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,779
what are the keys to success on this

751
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,220
first one I mentioned it should be

752
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,419
somewhat obvious because one of the

753
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,340
first questions I get asked when we talk

754
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,470
about privileged account management for

755
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,990
an organization is well where's my you

756
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,149
know break the glass and in case of

757
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:59,919
emergency because if your systems down I

758
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,200
can't get into my system it's the first

759
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,580
question that usually gets asked well

760
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,230
the answer to that is fault tolerance if

761
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,100
my system is always available and when I

762
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,480
say always available I'm not talking

763
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,090
five nines I'm you know if a systems

764
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,649
down for ten seconds they're going to

765
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:18,070
survive because it's just access to that

766
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,710
system that may slow them down but you

767
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,899
must have a highly resilient deployment

768
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:28,000
the second piece and I cannot stress

769
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,029
this enough you must have senior

770
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,500
leadership support within your company

771
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,779
and I know that says for a lot of

772
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,940
different security initiatives but this

773
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,730
one in particular is extremely salient

774
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,330
because if you call up the manager of

775
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,919
your Linux administration team and you

776
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,889
say hey Ted I've got this project I'm

777
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:48,970
rolling out and we're going to be

778
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,980
enrolling all of the Linux systems into

779
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,580
this

780
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,160
and in the interim it's probably going

781
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,600
to make your life a little harder and

782
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,280
it's going to slow you guys down a

783
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,440
little bit he's going to say that's

784
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,890
great Lance I'm really busy with

785
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,480
projects right now so i'll probably get

786
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,100
you get back to you sometime in two

787
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,020
thousand and never in the second

788
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,000
component of this and this is true of a

789
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,620
lot of different areas but particularly

790
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,060
with respect to identity and access

791
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,660
management if you can tie it policy it

792
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,660
gives you that cudgel when you walk into

793
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,190
the meeting if you need to use it

794
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,450
obviously you want to use the carrot

795
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,190
first before you bring the stick if you

796
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,870
can tie it to policy and have the senior

797
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,850
leadership management it will make your

798
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,810
adoption rate go up considerably because

799
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,400
ultimately senior leadership is saying

800
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,130
guess what this is an optional and then

801
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,000
you know I've mentioned this before

802
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,060
focus on the process first have the

803
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,010
tooling in mind as a component within

804
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,470
the process but you know focus on the

805
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,310
process first be creative your

806
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,930
organization is is different from other

807
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,550
organizations obviously you have a lot

808
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,680
of the same pain points but how you use

809
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,750
data how you use accounts is going to

810
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,160
vary within the organization so be

811
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,480
creative in terms of how you create

812
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,600
those controls when you are selecting a

813
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,910
vendor as i mentioned consider the cloud

814
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,680
implications challenge them on how

815
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,100
they're tackling cloud infrastructure to

816
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,570
ensure the church you know the service

817
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,340
that you're acquiring can take that into

818
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,510
account because if it can't and you're

819
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,880
leveraging heavily on the cloud you

820
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,800
might be falling short of the value

821
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,040
realized in the product you select i

822
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,540
also recommend highly eating your own

823
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,700
dog food first that's true of most IT

824
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,830
initiatives but start with your own key

825
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,470
privileged accounts within your team

826
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,430
that's one of the things that we did and

827
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,750
we've got a lot of things we did like

828
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,150
about the tool we bought so we went up

829
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,350
i'm gonna go back to the vendor and go

830
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,820
you know how do we account for this and

831
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,020
it required that we start getting

832
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,630
creative with some of our controls and

833
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,040
that was knowledge that we could pass on

834
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,600
to the business when we engage them and

835
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,910
then finally and i mentioned this a

836
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,460
little bit earlier don't think you're

837
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,680
too small for this you may be at a

838
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,290
company of 50 employees and have you

839
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,050
know a minimal of IT infrastructure

840
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,420
that doesn't mean there are aspects of

841
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,860
privileged access management you can't

842
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,150
be doing today to help protect your

843
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,100
company because I guarantee you there

844
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,930
cost for a hit is it going to be a lot

845
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,730
bigger than the cost that ebay sustains

846
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,460
in terms of its impact ebay may be

847
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,080
saying okay you know we're going to take

848
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,160
a hit for three hundred million dollars

849
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,170
well when there are 12 billion dollar

850
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,870
company that's a drop in the bucket but

851
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,850
for a smaller company that maybe is only

852
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,190
40 million in business you know that's a

853
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,570
much bigger impact that they could be

854
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,860
taking on I kind of blew through the

855
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,170
slides a little bit but I definitely

856
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,370
wanted to leave a lot of time for

857
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,939
questions so

858
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,789
yes sir

859
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,789
technicians that are out

860
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,970
there are tools I mean that that's part

861
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,559
of the vaulting capability that you'll

862
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,300
find pretty much across the spectrum

863
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,370
with any of the Pam products that are

864
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,860
out there and they can automatically

865
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,030
connect as long as they have

866
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,340
connectivity to that device if its local

867
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,630
that's where again you have to get

868
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,700
creative and like one of the things that

869
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,140
I encourage is if they're deploying

870
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,290
servers say for example from a template

871
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,400
obviously it has the same admin account

872
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,750
every time you deploy that template the

873
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,280
first thing in your operational manual

874
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,910
should be all right I updated this local

875
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,520
admin password to you know this 64

876
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,980
character password and you can make it

877
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,840
that long because if you go to the Pam

878
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,309
tool it's just going to copy and paste

879
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,450
it and you don't have to worry about it

880
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,330
that way it's a lot stronger password

881
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,410
but that's one way that you could

882
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,809
achieve that if connectivity isn't

883
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,460
available if it is I would encourage you

884
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,050
know a vaulting solution in that

885
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,480
scenario and then one of the things that

886
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,580
can happen is even without that workers

887
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,440
knowledge that can change that password

888
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,179
periodically and the users none the

889
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:20,090
wiser that makes sense I think the other

890
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,170
thing I wanted I'm sorry you had a

891
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,260
question

892
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,860
absolutely and the other piece that most

893
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,320
of the Pam tools out there will have as

894
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,880
workflow surrounding that so especially

895
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,190
for more sensitive privileged to count

896
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,840
you can put workflow behind it so if you

897
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,210
do want to reset that password even if

898
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,799
the notification because they're not

899
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,120
going to send the password to your email

900
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,620
the good news in that scenario is it

901
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,940
would send you a link to go back to the

902
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,830
Pam tool and say like say for example I

903
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,510
had to go to my boss to get approval to

904
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,730
reset the password on this server once

905
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,918
my boss approved it I would then click

906
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:17,940
on the link that would take me into the

907
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,440
Pam tool I can now check out that

908
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,089
account again so what we're trying to

909
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:22,889
get out of is the business of passwords

910
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,960
really all together we know that's not

911
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,440
realistic so if we can control who knows

912
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,389
what that password is at any given point

913
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,609
in time and you know going back through

914
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,440
the use cases that's where the session

915
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,679
management is so valuable because

916
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,820
they're initiating that session they

917
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,800
have no awareness whatsoever of what

918
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,899
that password is now I'm going to put a

919
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,339
caveat on this because we are at a

920
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,500
hackers conference there are ways to

921
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,839
figure out what that password is yeah

922
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,879
because if you're in an rdp session

923
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,980
where the server is pasting it there's a

924
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,409
good chance your client may see what's

925
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,730
going on if you're paying attention to

926
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,580
the traffic so that's why adding that

927
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,080
additional password control especially

928
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,330
for highly sensitive accounts once the

929
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,859
admin session is done go ahead and

930
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:08,400
change the password you know that way

931
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,830
you know when you're auditing team comes

932
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,400
calling and they will you could say we

933
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,510
have this control and we have this

934
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,530
control and they're going to walk away

935
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,280
satisfied yes sir

936
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:32,680
I think its intrinsic to it especially

937
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,890
given the distributed nature of the

938
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,890
organization if you're you know

939
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,890
outsourcing to you know a company in

940
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,570
Ireland who's going to do a lot of your

941
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,970
remote administration for you having

942
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,890
another factor to get into the Pam

943
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,220
system is extremely valuable and again

944
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,290
most of the tools out there will do that

945
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,120
I wouldn't buy a tool that didn't

946
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,920
support it and you can do that through a

947
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,990
number of functions you could use pki so

948
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,580
that only managed devices are coming

949
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,370
across or you could use tokens things of

950
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,140
that nature but I would recommend it

951
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,130
especially for the more sensitive

952
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,230
accounts yes sir

953
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,680
absolutely I mean any fact I mean here's

954
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,700
the challenge you want to get into and

955
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,530
security is always about you know

956
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,040
convenience versus security right it

957
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,119
depends on what you're doing and the

958
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,190
data that you're protecting you know if

959
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,350
you talk to DoD their use of smart cards

960
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,380
it's been extremely successful for them

961
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,210
if you talk to a small 50-person company

962
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,440
whether they want to do biometrics

963
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,520
they're probably going to say yeah we're

964
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,740
not there yet but they might you know

965
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,050
maybe invest in some RSA tokens you know

966
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,320
something along those lines you know I

967
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,090
think it particularly depends on who

968
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,920
you're collaborating with but you know

969
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,340
to me if passwords are the only way that

970
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,869
you're getting access to a system in

971
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:56,000
most use cases you need to look at

972
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
another factor of authentication and go

973
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,720
with it it's just you can avoid so many

974
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,330
headaches it's not foolproof I have no

975
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:06,110
delusions in that sense but it improves

976
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,470
your chances of surviving a breach

977
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:14,080
exponentially yes sir

978
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:20,029
well I'm going to briefly do a plug for

979
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,429
my friend in the back of the room from

980
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:26,719
wicked systems they they certainly can

981
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,769
help you out in that regard there's a

982
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:29,059
there's a lot of vendors in that space

983
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,619
they have a pretty novel approach to it

984
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,390
that I particularly appreciate

985
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,369
unfortunately my company didn't get

986
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,390
there fast enough but but you know there

987
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,709
was a lot of good players out there and

988
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,929
great opportunity to plug one of our key

989
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,419
sponsors of b-sides so I didn't want to

990
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:47,150
miss that chance and nickel pay you ten

991
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:52,189
dollars later haha yeah you get a free

992
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:58,400
token anybody else I think the one last

993
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,499
comment i want to make was specific to

994
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:02,239
the gds presentation you know they were

995
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,499
talking about when you know when they're

996
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:06,549
doing pen tests and they're looking at

997
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:09,199
servers that have jboss instances or you

998
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,329
find him a wordpress admin module on one

999
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:16,640
of your servers which I wish I didn't

1000
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,309
believe that but I've been in this

1001
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:23,719
business too long that's the critical

1002
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,429
piece you know there's one piece that

1003
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:26,989
has to be remediation and obviously

1004
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:28,419
their job is to find the vulnerabilities

1005
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:32,209
but that gets back to you know the ATM

1006
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,589
vendor who's still using the default

1007
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:37,519
password from 25 years ago that's where

1008
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,650
that piece and I talked about that

1009
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,890
collaborative aspect of it if you're in

1010
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,329
a large enough company that uses a

1011
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,579
methodology for systems deployment

1012
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,519
whether it's sdlc ITIL DevOps whatever

1013
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,909
it is get that aspect into their

1014
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,949
operational profiles so that they're not

1015
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:58,309
only managing it and enrolling it within

1016
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:59,809
the system but it's starting at the very

1017
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,609
beginning of that system development

1018
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,289
life cycle because the more that you can

1019
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,599
achieve at the front end of that and get

1020
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,059
into the beginning of the project it's

1021
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,380
going to make their lives so much easier

1022
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,880
down the road so some of that

1023
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,919
operational overhead that you get by

1024
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,569
remediating with privileged access

1025
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:17,209
management actually diminishes over time

1026
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:18,439
because it's already built into the

1027
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,949
process for deploying that system any

1028
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:24,519
other questions

1029
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,510
well thank you guys very much for your

1030
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,140
time I appreciate it
