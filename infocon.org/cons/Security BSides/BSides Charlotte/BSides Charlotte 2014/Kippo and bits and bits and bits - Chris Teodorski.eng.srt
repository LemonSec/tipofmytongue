1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
alright well first of all thanks

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,000
everybody for coming i will try not to

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,009
wander i tend to wander around the stage

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,309
and i will try not to do that as John

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,410
said my name is Kristy door ski and the

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,460
first talk is on ssh honey potting or as

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,289
I called it Capo's hippo and bits and

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,680
bits and bits so first of all a little

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,300
bit about me as I said my name is

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,910
Christian or ski I'm a dad and a husband

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,939
I just recently started as a security

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,340
analyst for emc Rubicon that is emcs

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,809
cloud offering I'm a full-time geek I am

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,500
at can o beans on Twitter and I'll put

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,750
my little plug in here the cert that I

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,670
have that I'm the most proud of is the

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,280
OS CP which is the offensive security

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,199
hands on pentesting cert and it's very

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,899
inexpensive and it is the cert that I

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,309
have like I said that I'm the most proud

21
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,129
of it's it's a hell of a bargain and

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,500
you'll learn a ton if you take it not

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,480
getting paid for saying this or anything

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,549
I just it's I was really really

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,250
impressed with the class and what they

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,060
offer the other thing I promised my boss

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,159
I would say is we are hiring so we have

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,970
two security positions open on my team

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,710
they are a hundred percent work from

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,990
home positions one of them is a senior

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,400
level position and one is a mid-level

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,220
position so I can't guarantee you a job

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,750
but I can guarantee I can get your

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,159
resume to the right people if you want

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,590
to get it to me and like I said you can

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,689
be anywhere in the country so because it

37
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,299
is one hundred percent work from home so

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,619
I did promise I would put that in and

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,680
that's quite enough about me and let's

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
get down to the talk so let's talk about

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,619
what a honeypot is first of all a

42
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,070
honeypot is a system on your network

43
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,250
that serves no purpose other than to be

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,399
a target for a bad guy right that's

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,939
that's essentially what a honeypot is

46
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,860
and I would break honey pots down into

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,469
two different categories there's an

48
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,500
analysis things like honey d the

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,120
honeynet project these are things where

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,800
you can install your honey pot

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,340
learn about what the attackers are doing

52
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,410
then there's also the delay now these

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,850
are things like the La Brea tar pit

54
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,080
that's a project that's been around

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,330
forever essentially what that does is

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,610
when an attacker hits it they get tar

57
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,830
pit they get stuck in it and you know

58
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,230
scanners and things take a long time to

59
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,670
run through the Tar Pits so it's

60
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,270
designed to slow them down again the

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,910
idea is that this resource exists solely

62
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,700
to be compromised right that's the only

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,170
reason it exists it doesn't offer any

64
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,180
other services and that's important

65
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,670
because the only traffic it should ever

66
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,850
see is a legitimate traffic shouldn't

67
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,200
ever be seeing legitimate traffic so

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,750
when I when I started this talk I

69
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,550
started when I decided to do this talk I

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,370
started doing a lot of research into the

71
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,670
honeypot and what I call the rise and

72
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,450
fall and rise again of the honeypot the

73
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,970
first reference in print anyways to a

74
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,250
honeypot is Cliff's Tolls book the

75
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,580
Cuckoo's egg which was written in 1989

76
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,600
if you haven't read the book I highly

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,690
recommended it's an easy read cliff was

78
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,989
working for Berkeley Lab's and noticed a

79
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,239
discrepancy in the way they were billing

80
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,940
CPU time and then discovered that

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,040
someone had accessed their computers and

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,110
was completely was continually accessing

83
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,420
their computers so he set up a honeypot

84
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,910
to capture these intruders and like I

85
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,770
said it's it's a it's a very it's a very

86
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,790
interesting read in the early 2000s

87
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,000
honey pots were a hot idea when you

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
google honeypot you'll find lots of

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,050
stuff from you know 10 15 years ago that

90
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,970
talks about honey pots there were a lot

91
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,470
of manufacturers there are a lot of

92
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,670
commercial honeypot products out there

93
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,540
symantec was selling a product called

94
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,700
man trap there was Specter net bait KF

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,940
sensor but all these products kind of

96
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,899
were there and then gone and so if you

97
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,399
look at now there there's there's

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,350
there's honey pots out there most of

99
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,240
them are non-commercial and i'll get to

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,130
that in a second so while i was googling

101
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,720
I did run

102
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,330
cross this product and there's an inside

103
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,490
security community joke coming up so

104
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,250
just so you just so you're ready for

105
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,590
that I did come across this product and

106
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,360
and I was very interested in at first

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,650
cuz I was like oh wow look this is a

108
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,680
commercial honey pot and then I started

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,570
reading about it and yeah it kind of is

110
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,250
and then I saw that it hadn't been

111
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,500
updated in a long time and then a lot of

112
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,020
the wording on it just seemed weird like

113
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,420
they were calling it an IDs and I guess

114
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,460
I can see how you would say a honeypot

115
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,590
is an IDs an intrusion detection system

116
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,560
but it's not really exactly the same

117
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,310
thing and then the more I read about it

118
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,450
the more I thought it sounded like

119
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,800
something this guy wrote and so for any

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,090
of you who don't know this is the

121
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,020
world's number one hacker gregory evans

122
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,500
who has is quite infamous for his his

123
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,510
his bravado and his lack of abilities so

124
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,890
we'll just kind of will just kind of

125
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,630
leave it at that so as I was as I was

126
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,390
researching this I started to wonder why

127
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,150
the honeypot had kind of its why there

128
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,470
was all this commercial interest in

129
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,800
honey pot in two thousand and then by

130
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,030
2005-2006 it seemed like everybody had

131
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,979
exited the market you know what what

132
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,560
happened why was it why wyd was the

133
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,169
interest lost so I went to Twitter

134
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,970
because that's what I do and said hey

135
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,250
why is what's what's up with the honey

136
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,110
pot like why is no one interested in the

137
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,620
honey pot anymore and and Nick Harbor

138
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,050
who was at the time malware analyst for

139
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,740
mandiant i'm not sure if he still is

140
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,200
responded to me and he said maybe

141
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,060
because it's a waste of time and never

142
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,090
improved security and i was like geez

143
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,680
that hurts because i think this is a

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,229
pretty cool idea and to say that it was

145
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:17,490
a waste of time and never improved

146
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,030
security I don't know that's just so I

147
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,590
started thinking about it myself and I

148
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,810
started thinking about again after I

149
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,220
after I kind of went through the

150
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,050
exercises that I went through to prepare

151
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,800
for this talk i realized that i think my

152
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,110
theory anyways on why honey pots lost

153
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,479
lost their their their glamour and why

154
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,360
they lost interest is because i don't

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,569
think any of them at the time were kind

156
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,400
of that click click drool tool where you

157
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,289
could just kind of get really easy

158
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,400
intelligence out of them and so that's

159
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,710
my suspicions I don't really know what

160
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,939
what happened I mean it could just be

161
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,259
they weren't selling well right I mean

162
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,120
that that could be what it was but but

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,949
interest was definitely was definitely

164
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:07,990
lost now in 2011 I think it is here

165
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,400
symantec announced that they were going

166
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,280
to start selling a honeypot product

167
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,650
again but only to their large

168
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,250
enterprises and government and I don't

169
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,990
know what the status of this currently

170
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,430
is this offering what I do know is that

171
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,830
all of the all of the AV manufacturers

172
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,349
you know run honey pots honey nets

173
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,180
because they're collecting malware right

174
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,830
so they can they can watch for it and

175
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,710
apparently this basically semantics was

176
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,819
turning around and and taking their you

177
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,259
know what they were using internally and

178
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,969
marketing it to these to these large

179
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,690
customers and and according to the

180
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,629
article both their competitors were

181
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,740
rather surprised that they were doing

182
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,650
this and again you know I think it must

183
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,529
have been a tough sell to to to market

184
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,529
the honeypot so that's kind of all the

185
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:01,789
bad stuff that people have said about

186
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:03,589
honey pots and what why honey pots are

187
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,800
not maybe not in favor as much as they

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,089
as I think they should be but I think

189
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,960
Lenny Seltzer who teaches sands the

190
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,180
forensics the malware analysis class and

191
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,430
you know he's does a lot of malware

192
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,240
analysis and a lot of there's a lot of a

193
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,509
lot of teaching he posted this at one

194
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,050
point about honey pots and I mean you

195
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,520
guys are all very capable of reading but

196
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,190
I think the important part there is he

197
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,570
talks about in this he talks about it

198
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,198
being part of a mature enterprise and I

199
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:44,390
think that's probably one of the big

200
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,649
keys is that honey pot should not be the

201
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,180
first thing you deploy shouldn't be the

202
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,920
second thing you deploy shouldn't even

203
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
be the third thing right you should

204
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,660
really be

205
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,459
mature program before you even consider

206
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,269
deploying honey pots and maybe that's

207
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,639
why they fell out of favor because in my

208
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,470
experience there's not a lot of mature

209
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,470
security programs and that could be why

210
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,759
you know why the interest was was lost

211
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,790
the other thing to remember is that

212
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,680
deploying a honey pot as cool as I think

213
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,850
it is it's not a panacea you know if you

214
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,040
have compliance requirements that you

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,589
have to meet and you have an auditor

216
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,389
come in who finds this intentionally

217
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,180
vulnerable box it may be a tough sell I

218
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,129
think it depends on the auditor you know

219
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,589
if you have an intentionally vulnerable

220
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,899
windows box again that's you know it

221
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,819
doesn't look patched you know that looks

222
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,670
like a big black mark to 2a q SI or to

223
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,160
an auditor so there are there are real

224
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,899
challenges to deploying a honeypot but

225
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,610
for me it's a really fun Friday night

226
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,920
right because this is how I want to

227
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,480
spend my time and this is what I want to

228
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,500
do and I don't have to worry about

229
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,680
auditors or or q SAS or terms of service

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,829
or anything like that so let's talk

231
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,660
about Kip oh that's what I said we'd be

232
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,889
talking about and we're going to start

233
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,149
with Kip oh but we're not going to end

234
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,060
with kippo kippo is defined as a medium

235
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,230
interaction ssh honey pot and so honey

236
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,230
pots are kind of broken down from low

237
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,610
interaction medium interaction high

238
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,199
interaction solo interaction is

239
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:25,439
basically mimics a service so it opens a

240
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:28,560
port and says hey I'm netbios and that's

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,329
it that's as far as it goes right that's

242
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,680
and it's just to see if someone's

243
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,350
probing you then you have the medium

244
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,529
interaction honeypot where kippo kippo

245
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,170
mimics the entire shell so it looks and

246
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,319
feels like SSH it's not but it looks and

247
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,269
feels like it so when you connect to it

248
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,040
it's very hard to tell that you're not

249
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,860
actually on a real SSH connection and

250
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,990
then of course a high interaction would

251
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,370
be something like a full-blown operating

252
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,259
system right that you have that you're

253
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,459
watching what's going on so kippo is a

254
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,370
piece of cake to install it's really

255
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,319
easy to get running those are the

256
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,649
requirements

257
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,120
it's written in Python it's a piece of

258
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
cake it's it's you know basically that

259
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,960
will get you ready for kippo on debian

260
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,180
or good 12 in the case that i used

261
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,339
ubuntu that'll get you ready to go you

262
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,470
download and you extract it and you

263
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,480
execute it that's it I mean it's super

264
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,260
simple sort of now you do want to tweak

265
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,589
the config file there is the ssh port is

266
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,050
set the host name which is what the

267
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,060
system mimics right what it thinks what

268
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,010
you want it to announce its host name as

269
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,100
and the password now the password

270
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,540
obviously if you want to let attackers

271
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,630
in needs to be terrible because you want

272
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,250
them to successfully brute force this

273
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,450
right that's that's kind of the idea so

274
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,940
you set that and you're and you're set

275
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,970
and ready to go this should be obvious

276
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,620
if you care if you care about the box

277
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,270
that you're running this on if you don't

278
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,820
want the the base OS that you're running

279
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,070
this on to get compromised don't run it

280
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,890
as root kippo is well written well

281
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,400
tested but jeez don't do that because if

282
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,589
they manage to escape out of kippo they

283
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,520
are going to be owning your box and so

284
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,230
you know that that could be a very bad

285
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,220
situation now kippo will warn you if you

286
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,779
try to do that it'll say hey dum-dum

287
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,550
what are you doing stop it checks right

288
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,950
but again just putting that out there

289
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,440
don't don't do that now what that's

290
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,180
going to mean is you're going to have to

291
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,339
run on an unprivileged port which is

292
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,860
less than ideal because you want to be

293
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,190
running on 22 so that little IP table

294
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,250
rule the default kippo port is 222 to

295
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,260
that little IP table rule will redirect

296
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,339
anything coming in on 22 22 22 2 which

297
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,500
essentially gets you to appear as though

298
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,140
you have ssh running on the standard ssh

299
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,350
port so once you get this all set up and

300
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:07,140
running you just wait and they'll get

301
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,050
you might the password that i used most

302
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,620
was one two three four five six and it

303
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,990
the box got owned over and over and over

304
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,500
again as one would expect now what

305
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,540
hippo does is these are the folders that

306
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,830
you're going to be interested in kippo

307
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,250
so dl is the download folder so anything

308
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,380
that you're and again this is on your

309
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,000
base OS where you're seeing this not

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,550
inside the not inside the kippo faked

311
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,640
shell anything that your attacker

312
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,010
attempts to download get stored in that

313
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,050
download folder so you can go back and

314
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,000
take a look and see what they downloaded

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
the log will show all of the brute force

316
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,010
attempts so any user name and password

317
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,840
that they attempt gets written to the

318
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,490
log so you'll have all that and then

319
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,980
your TTYL is the coolest directory

320
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,290
because inside there what kippo gives

321
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,720
you is what they call vcr like playback

322
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
of the shell session so you can see

323
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,640
everything the attacker did while they

324
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,470
were interacting with your shell right

325
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,420
so you can play it back in in real time

326
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,010
and watch them interact with your shell

327
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,890
so now this is the live demo god so

328
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,360
we're going to try to watch a kippo a

329
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,430
kippo playback and we're going to see if

330
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,200
this is going to if this is going to

331
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,380
work

332
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,970
okay so

333
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,160
should only be the one file in there yes

334
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,529
so kippo comes with a script called play

335
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:01,040
log that is designed to play the log

336
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,379
sorry about that okay so this is what

337
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,999
you're seeing right here at the bottom

338
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,949
of the screen there is the actual

339
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,649
attacker interacting with my with my

340
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,419
session I called the hostname member i

341
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:17,369
said you could set the host name is

342
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:19,230
called it SSL web server so they're

343
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,819
clearing the history file right to hide

344
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,889
their their tracks and then they start

345
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,049
looking to see exactly what kind of

346
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,879
system they're interacting with now

347
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,809
they're going to set the root password

348
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,899
they're gonna change the password to

349
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,619
something they they know obviously I

350
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:36,209
don't know I don't know but I'll get to

351
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,389
that Pat the password stuff in a second

352
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,739
so you know they take a look to see and

353
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,660
kippo fakes all of this right this is

354
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,589
all this is all this is all fake stuff

355
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:47,970
so they're going to download their their

356
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,220
tools right which is what they're doing

357
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,279
with the W get there so they download

358
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,169
the tool yeah yeah so as you see there

359
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,269
typos right there making mistakes I mean

360
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,309
you can tell this is a person right this

361
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,169
is not an automated script this is a

362
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:08,160
person sitting there so now is when Kip

363
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,009
Oh will will show its some of its

364
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,110
weaknesses right because it's not really

365
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,389
the OS so they're trying to run their

366
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,829
tools and their tools are exploding

367
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:26,120
so so they're running through this and

368
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,379
now they're going to start looking to

369
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,790
see because you know obviously this

370
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,259
created a little confusion because why

371
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:37,759
isn't this tool working oh yeah exactly

372
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,050
that's what I said that's the thing i

373
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,790
love about this is you can actually it's

374
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,500
clearly a person and and my favorite

375
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,269
this is this is old this is probably two

376
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:54,290
years old now so look they're going to

377
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,430
check that you know to see because

378
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,350
they're they're confused what what you

379
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,089
know what kernel is this running who's

380
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,500
logged in so then this is the awesome

381
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,230
thing about Kip oh so they type exit but

382
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,959
kippo won't actually let them out right

383
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,470
so so it says localhost and now and now

384
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,030
we start getting confused right he's run

385
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,299
an nmap and i think he exits again he's

386
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:20,270
like okay what's going on here so all

387
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,130
his commands from his previous session

388
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,990
are still in the history right right it

389
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,340
absolutely should be so I believe so now

390
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,600
he's checking his interfaces right

391
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,659
because he's like where am I so he exits

392
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,159
again and he gets dropped back to the

393
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,000
kippo prompt again

394
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,820
so he exits again right he's a knee back

395
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,610
to the kippo prompt again so like I said

396
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,960
as I imagine this was incredibly

397
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:04,500
confusing to this this individual okay

398
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,180
so that's it so that's so he gets smart

399
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,740
at that point and finally actually

400
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:17,250
disconnects so so despite that last

401
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,230
display here's what I learned from my

402
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,620
kippo is and I say they're smarter than

403
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,280
I thought because there were a bunch of

404
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,590
people who clearly were doing this who

405
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,230
knew how to identify a kippah host right

406
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,120
there were limits to what kippo can do

407
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,190
and there were places they looked so for

408
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,710
example by default hippos etsy password

409
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,810
is empty so some of them would go

410
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,490
immediately in cat etsy password and

411
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,290
then they disappear they knew they'd hit

412
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,230
a honey pot right so so they were

413
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,060
smarter than I thought they had they had

414
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,030
learned ways to identify a honeypot so

415
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,590
what that meant was I had to keep

416
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,110
tweaking so for example because you can

417
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,600
add stuff to Kip OHS file system so I

418
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,120
took a real etsy password from one of my

419
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,590
machines and copied it in there so now I

420
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,270
knew that hurdle but there were other

421
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,400
things that they were checking that like

422
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,110
I said they they realized that this was

423
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,600
that this was a honey pot and I said

424
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,420
they are Chinese because a vast majority

425
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,190
of the IPS that I was collecting were

426
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,520
coming from China and actually at the

427
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,110
time I'm like that's kind of boring

428
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,450
because that's what I expected right

429
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,830
like I don't I don't know why I expected

430
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,110
the the kippah hosts that I were running

431
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,140
these on I was using to VP esas that

432
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,530
were actually not the VPS provider

433
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,770
that's here but I was using to VPS

434
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,800
providers and hosting these out there so

435
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,160
they were both us IPS and they were in

436
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,280
different parts of the country and like

437
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,480
i said i was just kind of disappointed

438
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,430
because I was like oh well they're there

439
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,840
that's that's exactly what I expected

440
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,760
like this is kind of this is kind of

441
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,960
boring

442
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,990
so after doing all this I said okay well

443
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,990
there's a problem in that I can't really

444
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,630
see what they want to do once they

445
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,419
compromise this host right because they

446
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,000
compromise it and they can't run their

447
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,770
tools because their tools don't actually

448
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,600
work because it's a mimicked it's a fake

449
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,940
doe s right so I want to see what

450
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,309
they're gonna do if they were allowed to

451
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,529
fully compromise a host right that's the

452
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:21,270
next that's the next place I want to go

453
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,010
so I'll put this disclaimer out here I

454
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,630
have a very good friend who lives up in

455
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,490
Pittsburgh who's an attorney who after

456
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,200
he saw this was like you need to tell

457
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,970
people not to do this this is a very bad

458
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,880
idea so i'll put the disclaimer out

459
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,970
there the stuff that i did ended up in

460
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,190
with my box getting compromised and my

461
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,830
box being used despite my best efforts

462
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,970
in real attacks I did my best to limit

463
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,210
that possibility but as you'll see my

464
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,919
box was actually used in a real attack

465
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,809
and had that been tracked back it would

466
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,120
have come back to my IP and I would have

467
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,730
I would have had some splainin to do so

468
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,700
so you know doing this could end you up

469
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,899
with a pair of these it could which in

470
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:09,399
turn might end up with some of that but

471
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:11,380
more than likely you're going to end up

472
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,179
with that because you violated your

473
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,789
isp's terms of service because I was

474
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,950
running this at my house and so you're

475
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,590
going to end up with no internet so

476
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,899
that's my disclaimer you know do do with

477
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,510
this information what you will so this

478
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,120
is the way I set up my home network what

479
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,090
I did was I you know this this right

480
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,390
here is my external firewall and then

481
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,390
over here this is actually a single ESX

482
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,480
host vmware ESX host and it is hosting a

483
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,570
pfsense box linux box with a horrible

484
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,510
password snort and a client machine and

485
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,770
i'll explain the client machine in a

486
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,500
moment and then over here was my home

487
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,710
network or where I keep my porn and that

488
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,510
needed to be safe from the attackers

489
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,649
right that was that was key so the Linux

490
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,090
box with a horrible password had the

491
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,639
password of one two three four five six

492
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:03,870
again

493
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,289
and it was done using non persistent

494
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,710
disk in VMware so that allowed me to

495
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,809
reboot the box and wipe out anything the

496
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,549
attackers had done so i could basically

497
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:18,220
kick them out and and start over from

498
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,010
scratch but what that also meant was

499
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,559
that if that box rebooted I lost any

500
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,630
evidence that i had collected right

501
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,190
because it was reset back to where it

502
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,450
was so this Linux box was set up here

503
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,789
with two interfaces so I would power

504
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,010
that box on when I needed to move data

505
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,620
out of that linux that the horrible

506
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,780
linux box the horrible password linux

507
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,059
box so that's what that client was for i

508
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,950
had snort out there watching stuff

509
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,250
honestly I didn't end up using it much

510
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,190
because pfsense has a neat little

511
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,690
feature where it can do full packet

512
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,030
captures all the time so I just turned

513
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,820
that on and relied on my own ability to

514
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,140
go through the packet captures and take

515
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,980
a look at what was going on so that was

516
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,559
my setup that's what I did I then opened

517
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,460
SSH on my you know my consumer it was a

518
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,230
verizon internet connection at the time

519
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,330
and said okay how about it guys so the

520
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,210
way i configure my honey pot was I used

521
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,720
sudo sh which is a shell that allows

522
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,480
that VCR like playback that we got out

523
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,159
of Kip oh I really didn't want to lose

524
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,440
that because that's a really cool thing

525
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,030
to watch what they're actually doing I

526
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,830
really wanted to be able to see what

527
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,039
keystrokes they were entering now sudo

528
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,929
sh when you look at what shell is set

529
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:40,570
for the user shows up as pseudo sh so I

530
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,570
said okay well I'm gonna hide this so I

531
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,020
called it ksh even though it was clearly

532
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,590
bash and they and that that was fine

533
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,270
again I wasn't doing a lot of effort to

534
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,909
really mask what I was doing I said I

535
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,320
didn't try to be very I didn't try very

536
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,530
hard to be secretive I also hacked the

537
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,020
ssh binary that was installed on there

538
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,320
because one of the other things kippo

539
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,059
again I'm kind of trying to mimic kippo

540
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,409
on a live system one of the other things

541
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,049
kippo does is it provides you with a

542
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:15,190
list of all of the IPS the username and

543
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,600
passwords that we're attempted in the

544
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,140
brute force

545
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,170
I still wanted to collect that SSH would

546
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,160
hide that because it would have been

547
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,820
encrypted so I am NOT a sea programmer

548
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,790
so I'll put that out there I hacked this

549
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,670
the the auth password sea and made it

550
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,430
right a log file I'm sure there's more

551
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,740
elegant ways to do this I'm sure there's

552
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,620
just downright better ways to do it

553
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,110
forget elegance just better but it's out

554
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,990
there so if you like it feel free I just

555
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,150
packed it up we compiled it and put it

556
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,220
out there and it writes all of the

557
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,320
username and passwords to a clear text

558
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,020
file so obviously don't use this on a

559
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,570
production machine because it will write

560
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,930
your username and password in clear text

561
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,460
so it's out there help yourselves and

562
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,980
again you know improve it because I'm

563
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,210
sure there's improvements that could be

564
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,850
made but that's that's a little bit of

565
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,530
code I changed it really wasn't a hard

566
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,000
heart hack to get it in so these are the

567
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,530
logs that I started to collect on this

568
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,450
machine so again as you can see this is

569
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,130
what the log looks like it just gets its

570
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,640
time password or username password and

571
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,540
an originating IP so nothing nothing

572
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,750
spectacular so I set it up and I waited

573
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,990
and of course the box gets owned over

574
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,050
and over and over again I'm pulling

575
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,240
stuff off and one of the interesting

576
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,030
things that that I saw and again I saw

577
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,460
this in kippo as well one of the things

578
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,670
they do is they download windows service

579
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,970
packs my guess is that they are using

580
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,000
that as a benchmark for speed that

581
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,290
they're trying to see what kind of

582
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,880
connection they're sitting on that's the

583
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,900
only thing I can come up with because

584
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,030
they clearly know they're on linux boxes

585
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,830
and they're downloading windows service

586
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,990
packs my guess is it's a big file they

587
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,820
know Microsoft has a big pipe so they

588
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,080
just want to get an idea of what kind of

589
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,580
bandwidth they're they're up against or

590
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,240
it's the script other than I mean it

591
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,380
will get into that will get it ya know

592
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,770
we'll get into that so as I said

593
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,240
obviously the box gets owned over and

594
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,150
over and over again it was almost always

595
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,790
the same malware and there was usually a

596
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,830
IRC command and control and that might

597
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,880
be on another slide I might be getting

598
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,059
ahead of myself there was an IRC command

599
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,279
roll it was usually a denial of service

600
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,970
tool there was a another an ssh brute

601
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,950
force scanning tool and password

602
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,690
username and password lists was almost

603
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,730
always the same thing that appeared on

604
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,580
there and they were almost always hidden

605
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,120
in the same places so they didn't vary a

606
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,249
lot in where they and where they hid

607
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,429
these files but this time I had a little

608
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:59,049
more than I had with the capo box

609
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,649
because now I had packet captures so I

610
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:03,909
could see everything they were doing

611
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:09,220
inbound and outbound and how much time

612
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,200
do I have Mike I'm right at 30 minutes

613
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,649
okay so let's whoops so let's go ahead

614
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:21,070
and so this is just to give you an idea

615
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,649
I have a pseudo SH capture here and

616
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:27,879
basically you're going to see the same

617
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,330
thing

618
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,150
okay so i called the box phoenix because

619
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,620
of course it burns in the fire and then

620
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,640
reemerges but basically like i said

621
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,350
you'll see that they it's pretty much

622
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,150
the same stuff you know he's going

623
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,680
through his tools i have this sped up a

624
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
little so if it looks like he's typing

625
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,400
real fast i have it at double speed just

626
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,350
so we get through it quicker so again

627
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,090
this is a live host this is actual you

628
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,280
know he has he has root access to this

629
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,180
box at this point

630
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:32,510
so again downloading tools the couple

631
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,030
rules I put in on my pfsense box while

632
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,059
this is running my suspicion was and

633
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,590
again because I couldn't actually see

634
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,539
what they were doing with Kip oh my

635
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,010
suspicion was that they were using these

636
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,789
boxes to send out spam so I blocked 25

637
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:50,539
outbound and I also blocked SSH well I

638
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,409
black hold SSH so that they scanned and

639
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,510
just got no responses and they did scan

640
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,460
from my box they would use my box as a

641
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,559
pivot point to try to scan to compromise

642
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,900
other hosts so as you can see like I

643
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,070
said you get the idea of what you get

644
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,390
with sudo SH this is not a particularly

645
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,929
you know there's no humor in this one

646
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:16,610
let's put it that way so we'll get out

647
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,080
of that but you get the idea sudo SH

648
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,690
gets you the same kind of playback which

649
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,789
I think might be useful ultimately if

650
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:25,010
you have audit requirements that require

651
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,679
you to see what's going on in a command

652
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,240
line so I think it might have uses

653
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,880
outside of just watching what the bad

654
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,880
guys are doing so like I said these are

655
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,970
the tools that showed up all the time

656
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,010
you had IRC mec bot which was for

657
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,580
command and control the PS scan or some

658
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,380
variant of it which was for ssh

659
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,110
brute-forcing different denial of

660
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,169
services tools lots of them in Perl and

661
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,960
a user and password list now what was

662
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,520
interesting about the user and password

663
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,350
list is they all dropped username and

664
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,159
password lists and I grabbed the largest

665
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,659
of them like i said i was pulling data

666
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:07,520
off of that machine rather regularly and

667
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,870
then rebooting it and starting it over

668
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,610
again and i grabbed the largest of the

669
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,390
of the password list and it was like

670
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,350
230,000 passwords if i remember

671
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,539
correctly and then I unique tit and

672
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,190
there was only like a hundred and thirty

673
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,080
thousand unique passwords so they were

674
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,659
doing all kinds of redundant work which

675
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,600
got me real interested in very curious

676
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,720
about kind of the skill level of these

677
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,669
individuals like it seemed it seem kind

678
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,740
of odd to me that that's what was going

679
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,630
on but

680
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,560
I did have these packet captures now so

681
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,900
you probably can't see that this is them

682
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,090
attempting to ssh brute force something

683
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,210
so I mean they're just blasting away at

684
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,970
SSH again my firewall is you see just

685
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,490
sins because my firewall is pfsense box

686
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,900
is just tossing it away it's just

687
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,560
ignoring it not responding the other

688
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,710
thing you have here this is so this was

689
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,500
actually my box being used in a denial

690
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,620
of service attack I had blocked outbound

691
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,360
ports that I thought they would use

692
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,360
right the obvious stuff this was when I

693
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,640
had thought of and so they were

694
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,770
attacking somebody they were doing a UDP

695
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,380
denial of service which was successful

696
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,600
because I didn't block that so that that

697
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,820
went out and i participated but then the

698
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,120
other thing was I said they had dropped

699
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,770
IRC command and control so I had I RC

700
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,150
being in clear text they weren't using

701
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,220
SSL so everything was in clear text so I

702
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,760
could actually see what was going on so

703
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,030
this is them connecting to their their

704
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,460
owned box connecting back to IRC for a

705
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,190
command and control and I apologize that

706
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,340
that's that's so small so when I looked

707
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,370
at the when I was going through all the

708
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,570
packet captures and I was kind of

709
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,940
looking at what the packet capture

710
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,880
contained and looked at the IRC stuff

711
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,430
you can't I am I apologize that's so

712
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,770
small one of the channels they joined

713
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,080
was i'm going to call i'm gonna say it's

714
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,130
peccole OPIC oll oh and that's

715
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,500
significant because i started thinking

716
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,810
well i'm going to join this IRC channel

717
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,870
and see what what the deal is right like

718
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,500
what's going on here so i put pocholo

719
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,880
into google and google said do you mean

720
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,840
piccola which apparently is a dragon

721
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,550
ball z character nothing i'm familiar

722
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,600
with but I said ok so there's my cover

723
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,480
again it's a silly stupid cover but I'm

724
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,220
going to go in and I'm going to create a

725
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,410
fake identity for myself and I'm going

726
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,130
to say that I am a 16 year old kid

727
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,230
although clearly not 16 but I'm a 16

728
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,280
year old kid

729
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,200
and I'm really interested in Dragon Ball

730
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,300
Z and I'm going to join the channel and

731
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,390
see and see how it goes so I did I

732
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,260
joined the channel and this is what i

733
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,720
was first greeted with so as I joined

734
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,070
the channel there was no password on it

735
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,660
there was nothing protecting it I just

736
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,880
joined and I see all these names and

737
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,650
then I see someone saying say a and then

738
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,770
all the bots are spawned a now one of

739
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,770
the things I will tell you is i

740
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,340
sanitized all of this so that those are

741
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,710
not real IRC names and I will explain

742
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,040
that as we get to the end why I did that

743
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,420
so those are not those are not real

744
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,650
names so say a so one of the first

745
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,900
things I did was I said we'll say a

746
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,410
right when he said say a and then I said

747
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,690
well why isn't it doing what I want it

748
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,670
to do and let me see which slides next

749
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,290
okay so actually here it is so I said

750
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,850
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna become friends

751
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,590
with these guys right like I'm gonna see

752
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,330
if I can get them to start talking to me

753
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,500
so I said as you can see there so my

754
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,080
name that I came in was fava bean which

755
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,050
again my handles canna beans so it

756
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,730
wasn't very far from actually who I

757
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,469
wasn't doing a lot to really protect my

758
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,409
to protect who I was so I came in his

759
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:17,418
fava bean and he says fava bean and I

760
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:20,418
said say a and he says a right the bots

761
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:21,830
don't respond because they're not

762
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,949
supposed to respond to me and I said how

763
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,480
come it doesn't work for me and then I

764
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,949
start with my whole dragon ball z thing

765
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,469
I'm a big fan of Dragon Ball Z and he

766
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,350
asked me how old I am and I said 16 how

767
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,409
old are you 24 and I said oh you're not

768
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,090
too old for Dragon Ball Z and he said

769
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,060
well I've seen cartoons once and I said

770
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,699
once and I said I thought this was a

771
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,340
dragon ball z channel and he said

772
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,960
evenings we've seen and I said are you

773
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,380
in Japan or us and he said Europa and I

774
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,730
was like well this is not what I

775
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,199
expected right like I thought I was

776
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,850
dealing I was honestly expecting to see

777
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,230
a lot of chinese language flying back

778
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,740
and forth well i hung out in the channel

779
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,869
a lot and what I watched was

780
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,269
a language going back and forth that I

781
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:08,700
didn't recognize and I started copying

782
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,630
and pasting it into google translate and

783
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,200
all of it was what I discovered was our

784
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,640
PT or Romanian persistent threat all of

785
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,289
the language that was being spoken was

786
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,509
Romanian which was clear which was not

787
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:30,960
at all what I expected and so it was it

788
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,519
was a daunting task because i don't

789
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,839
speak Romanian so I'm sitting there

790
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,690
trying to copy and paste in out of IRC

791
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,190
to at least get an idea of what they're

792
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,759
talking about in you know into google

793
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,589
translate well unfortunately and I

794
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:45,630
assume it would be the same going from

795
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,299
English to if you took an English IRC

796
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,950
channel there was a ton of slang being

797
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,539
thrown around which Google had no idea

798
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,999
what to do with so so there was a lot of

799
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,529
stuff that was being said that I didn't

800
00:35:55,529 --> 00:36:00,769
understand so once I realized that I

801
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,619
started asking lots of questions because

802
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,359
some of them started some of them would

803
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,249
talk to me now clearly some of them were

804
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,369
saying don't talk to him right I mean I

805
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,200
caught some of that in Romanian it was

806
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,489
we don't know who this is don't talk to

807
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:19,410
him so you know I started asking you

808
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,660
know what's what's at you see as I

809
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,339
joined the channel the first thing it's

810
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,920
say a and I say a right and then because

811
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,539
he thinks i'ma bought at this point and

812
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:29,819
then he you know he tries to get me to

813
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:31,829
change my neck and I say Nick and then I

814
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:33,239
said why are you saying these things and

815
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,069
it's that point he realizes that I'm a

816
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,309
real person right and I said you know

817
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:39,569
why are you guys doing with all this say

818
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,369
a stuff I see you do it all the time and

819
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,529
then I asked so this was the command

820
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:46,920
that they issue the bang SSH that's the

821
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,630
command that they were issuing to their

822
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,099
to ping their bought to see if it was

823
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,499
alive and you know I said what does it

824
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:56,430
do and he said it pings la server and I

825
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,700
said why are there so many servers being

826
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,999
pinged and he says excuse me and

827
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,430
disappears like I don't know if I if he

828
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,099
got nervous but he just he never talked

829
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,269
to me again he was done with me so I

830
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:14,400
quickly dropped the dragon ball z thing

831
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,470
because obviously they had no idea what

832
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,869
I was talking about

833
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,400
so I asked them where they're from and

834
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,680
he said I one of the other one said I'm

835
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,980
Romanian and so then I was like okay now

836
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,170
I'm going to appeal to a sense of

837
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,810
nationalism I'm going to give that a try

838
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,800
so I started talking a lot about Romania

839
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,600
and asking lots of questions and I'm

840
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,080
really interested in in Romania and so

841
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,520
I'm you know I said I'm reading

842
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,560
Wikipedia on it now and he says good and

843
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,840
that actually worked like that got they

844
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,850
were interested that I was interested in

845
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,350
in Romania and then it got very

846
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,740
interesting because when I said I said

847
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,410
how old are you he said 23 and I said do

848
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,150
you work or go to school and he said I'm

849
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,070
stealing in other countries I mean he

850
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,080
just came right out and said I'm

851
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,230
stealing in other countries and I said

852
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,150
what and he said to survive and I said I

853
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,550
don't understand you know what what are

854
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,380
you stealing and he said all of it we

855
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,840
steal all of it how was like okay all

856
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,780
right well this is interesting now the

857
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,890
other interesting thing that I

858
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,750
discovered is there is in fact honor

859
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,330
amongst thieves I spent a lot of time in

860
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,480
this channel just lurking chatting as

861
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,000
much as I could again translating a lot

862
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,180
of what was going back and forth and so

863
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,510
i'm going to call this person raluca

864
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:42,810
again name changed so raluca became my

865
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,660
buddy raluca like to talk to me a lot

866
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,040
and raluca wanted to help seem to want

867
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,590
to help me out and I think part of it

868
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,940
was because raluca was close in age to

869
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,690
the character that I had created now

870
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,910
what this conversation is between raluca

871
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:07,260
and I again I'm after the whole you know

872
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,790
I want to learn about Romania I started

873
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,020
that I want to learn what you guys do

874
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,720
like I want to learn how you how you're

875
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,220
doing this I'm really curious to know

876
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,369
what you're doing and so someone on the

877
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:21,510
IRC channel said i'll sell you a route

878
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,220
if you want to buy a route that was that

879
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,540
was the terminology they used they refer

880
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,710
to them as routes that's what they were

881
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,880
selling and i said okay at the time I

882
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,200
said okay

883
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,700
do I get the money to you because he

884
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,869
said he would sell it to me for a dollar

885
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,730
and I so how do I get the money to you

886
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,230
and again I'm playing that I'm a

887
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,420
sixteen-year-old kid and I said I gotta

888
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,270
get my mom's paypal account and so I

889
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,589
said hold on i'm gonna get my mom's

890
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,089
paypal account so i can pay you and then

891
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:46,500
I said well do I need Romanian paypal

892
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,540
like I don't know how this works and as

893
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,530
soon as I was chatting with this

894
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,420
individual I got a private message from

895
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,030
raluca and as you see with Lucas says

896
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,190
man stay chill don't buy roots like a

897
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,770
dollar they're not roots and I said I

898
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,089
don't understand and he said those are

899
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:02,550
 you send him money he give you

900
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,760
nothing and or he gives you root and

901
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,430
takes it back so I'm like wow this guy's

902
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,920
talking to me and he's protecting me so

903
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,540
this is the guy I want to ask questions

904
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,849
of so I asked him I said well how much

905
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:17,609
should a good route cost and he said 10

906
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:21,480
to 20 euro which was way more than I

907
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,300
expected it to be and he said for a good

908
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,320
route it's you know he said one dollar

909
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,660
roots are and I said well is that

910
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,970
US or euro and he said euro so again

911
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,859
continue the conversation is it really a

912
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:40,560
bad idea to use my mom's paypal he tells

913
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,040
me I need to ask her before I do it okay

914
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,770
so I mean like I said they're there are

915
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,980
honor there is honor amongst thieves and

916
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,560
I said you know i'll tell her i'm buying

917
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,569
dragon ball z stuff from ebay like that

918
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,089
was my excuse and so he starts

919
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:59,099
explaining to me that he's scanning for

920
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,930
more roots like he shows me what he's

921
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,150
doing and he's telling me that he's

922
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,720
scanning 3,500 IPS and he said from

923
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,109
those he'll get 10 to 20 roots so I'm

924
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:14,010
putting myself in his shoes at 16 if I

925
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,829
had two hundred bucks coming in and

926
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:18,660
that's you know in the u.s. I would

927
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,609
imagine 200 euro in Romania goes a

928
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:23,160
little bit further that's I'd do a lot

929
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,000
of stupid things with that money so he

930
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,720
said you know it's a lot of money and he

931
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,339
said sometimes he gets no money it all

932
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,540
depends so again we continued this

933
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,369
conversation he and I talked a lot and

934
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,890
he actually went as far as to tell me

935
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,349
where he lived and what street he lived

936
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,990
on

937
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:49,480
um so now we'll get into why I changed

938
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,900
names um like I said he told me where he

939
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,780
lived he told me what street he told me

940
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,090
like he was excited that I was googling

941
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,070
that I was looking up what street he

942
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,190
lived on and so there it is that's

943
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:10,330
that's where he lives now one of the

944
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,110
reasons that I changed his the names is

945
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,260
because the more I got into this the

946
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,420
more I started realizing that I wasn't

947
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,400
sure exactly who I was dealing with

948
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,150
right now my assumption is that this was

949
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,340
a kid who was just supplementing his

950
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,040
income but I don't know right i don't

951
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,570
know he could be doing this under duress

952
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,970
right i don't i don't know the situation

953
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,520
and I suddenly started getting concerned

954
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,590
that is I give this talk somebody

955
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,710
recognizes those names and you know and

956
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,710
we have we have trouble on our hands he

957
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,180
has trouble on his hands I don't because

958
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,890
I'm far removed from it so that's why I

959
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,400
went ahead and changed all the names and

960
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,850
and everything is you know has been

961
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,600
sanitized so he goes on to explain how

962
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,770
to do what he's doing right he says you

963
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,480
know he'd out I asked if I can download

964
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,340
a tool and he says you have to have root

965
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,900
if you want to use it it's a scanner and

966
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,880
he says you scan eye peas and brute

967
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,760
force and he says it tries 1000 to 2000

968
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,440
user to password at an IP if it matches

969
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,430
bingo you got root in 20 bucks and I

970
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,960
said do you ever get in trouble and he

971
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,100
says no I'm under 18 and he said if he

972
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,690
was over 18 he could go to jail for this

973
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,210
but because he's under 18 his plan was

974
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,130
to do it until he hit 18 and then he

975
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:35,440
would stop so what's funny was I started

976
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,090
explaining to him I asked him I said

977
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,980
well because I was surprised that he was

978
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,450
like I can get off scot-free if I'm

979
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,000
under 18 and so I said well don't you

980
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,590
guys have juvie like don't you have the

981
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,150
equivalent of that and he's like what's

982
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,310
that and I started explaining to it and

983
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,660
when you explain it to someone and

984
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,250
you're like well it's a prison for kids

985
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,150
it just it just it starts not not

986
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,740
sounding very good right I was like

987
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,550
let's let's

988
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,980
let's not talk about that so you know I

989
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,570
said so what do you guys do with all

990
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,190
these like I see you getting them what

991
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,320
do you do with them and I said to use

992
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,120
him to play games right like what do you

993
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,100
do and he says we scanned for other

994
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,260
routes we can flood we can spam we can

995
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,910
make money so what I asked him was I

996
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,030
said you know who was buying these which

997
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,830
was the one question he wouldn't answer

998
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,890
his answer every single time was hahaha

999
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,500
people like you that was his only answer

1000
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,660
so I still don't know who they're

1001
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,030
actually selling these to my suspicion

1002
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,280
is still it's used for spam that's my

1003
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,900
suspicions because I can't figure out

1004
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,900
what else I mean botnet I guess but I

1005
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,970
just it seems like an awful lot of money

1006
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,090
to be paying to have route to get root

1007
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:52,030
access to it now the next the next slide

1008
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,250
that i'm going to show was something

1009
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,900
that was dumped into the IRC channel

1010
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,660
this to me looked like an accidental

1011
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,660
copy and paste because it was followed

1012
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,630
by nothing else other than this this

1013
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,490
appears to be someone's complete

1014
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,570
identity and again i sanitized all of

1015
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,170
this i don't know how legitimate it is

1016
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,690
but if you look here the thing that

1017
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,120
really made me think it was right was

1018
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,840
the ATM PIN matches the birth date so

1019
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,730
that made me go oh this is really

1020
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,190
somebody's ID and that's really when i

1021
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,750
started when this happened was when I

1022
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,150
really started going whoa I don't know

1023
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,500
who I'm messing with here like I don't

1024
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,750
know you know it could be Eastern

1025
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,280
European organized crime I mean I have

1026
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,740
no idea who I'm messing with and that

1027
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,270
was when I said okay I got to sanitize

1028
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,650
all this stuff and I got to be careful

1029
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,500
because again it's interesting this is

1030
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,420
as this is to me I don't want somebody

1031
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,550
getting hurt because of my stupid

1032
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:56,020
presentation here so so that was kind of

1033
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,460
the end of my my activities I stopped

1034
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,840
following the channel stop participating

1035
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,239
in it

1036
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,639
and so the question is so all of this

1037
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,559
after all of this you know what does

1038
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:09,729
this all mean like what's the takeaway

1039
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:11,229
for us this is all really interesting

1040
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,089
and it's it's an interesting story but

1041
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:15,519
what's the takeaway so the things that I

1042
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,729
learned were first of all that these

1043
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:21,459
guys were really script kiddies for hire

1044
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:23,619
and to the person who commented about

1045
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:26,319
following a script these guys did not

1046
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,839
consider themselves hackers I asked them

1047
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:30,429
I said oh you guys are hackers and he's

1048
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,379
like no you have to know sequel

1049
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:33,609
injection if you want to be a hacker

1050
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:36,249
that was that was the bar for them and

1051
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:38,949
they said you know were we're just

1052
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,449
following we're following a script

1053
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,399
essentially where we have a you know we

1054
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,959
have it steps that we walk through and

1055
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:45,939
that seemed to be the extent of what

1056
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:48,639
they knew so these were not you know

1057
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,169
these were not technical Wizards they

1058
00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:52,539
were just kind of following and I think

1059
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:54,099
the password with all of the you know

1060
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:55,959
how hard is it to unique a username and

1061
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,789
password file right i mean it's really

1062
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:01,029
easy but so i think that kind of speaks

1063
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,629
to their to their technical prowess so

1064
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:07,269
the other things that I learned use

1065
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:11,589
strong passwords obviously so those were

1066
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:13,119
what the passwords look like that we're

1067
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,099
in their file route 123 password 123

1068
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:19,349
Beavis but soul selection 123 and

1069
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:21,729
whatever that is was also in that list

1070
00:47:21,729 --> 00:47:24,069
so they did have some long ugly

1071
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:25,989
passwords in there where that came from

1072
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:28,839
no idea but the one thing that I noticed

1073
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:30,609
is not a single one of their passwords

1074
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:33,459
out of space in it not a single one so

1075
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:36,489
at least the list that I saw if you had

1076
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:37,839
a space in your password even if you had

1077
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,819
password space 1 2 3 they wouldn't get

1078
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:43,059
you so you know feel free to use a

1079
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,009
special characters use spaces make those

1080
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:49,119
passwords long and ugly all of the tools

1081
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,439
they were running we're on port 22

1082
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,359
everything was looking for standard ssh

1083
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:55,959
port so not a fan of security through

1084
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,149
obscurity however it will lower the

1085
00:47:58,149 --> 00:48:00,009
noise that you have to look at not

1086
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:01,539
saying you can ignore it and not look at

1087
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,429
the activity on that port if you move it

1088
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:06,459
but again you'llyou'll you know these

1089
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:09,039
guys will you know you will swell CH

1090
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,129
them pretty significantly also failed to

1091
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:14,019
ban failed demands awesome if you don't

1092
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,760
have it deployed really look at it

1093
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,320
will automatically add an IP table

1094
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,690
blacklist to a machine that is trying to

1095
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,370
an IP that is trying to brute force you

1096
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,230
so you can figure that and you can say

1097
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,820
you know what you get six failed

1098
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,730
attempts as an example and then I put an

1099
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,980
IP table block in for you for 15 minutes

1100
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,930
so that would essentially kill these

1101
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,550
guys like they'd be done at that point

1102
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,750
so and it's not just for ssh you can do

1103
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:45,920
it for ftp and other services so that's

1104
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,170
it there any questions I don't know how

1105
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,350
much time I have like we still got on

1106
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,000
time you don't know okay we're good on

1107
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,530
time then I have 10 minutes to there any

1108
00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:05,990
questions absolutely nothing so that was

1109
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,880
a nice lob up there tom because tom

1110
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,540
knows that I did nothing I so the one

1111
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,240
thing that I did was when I was

1112
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,460
connecting to IRC I didn't use my home

1113
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,820
IP address for that because I knew my

1114
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,350
home IP address was showing up in there

1115
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,060
bought list all the time right as a

1116
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,890
compromise host and I didn't want to

1117
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,420
show up because I wanted that them to be

1118
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,340
separate they weren't doing any kind of

1119
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,420
analytics I don't think they would have

1120
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,030
noticed but I just wanted to be on the

1121
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,000
safe side so I used a verizon air card

1122
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,620
anytime I connected so it was a separate

1123
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,170
IP address that was the only thing I did

1124
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,890
as far as any kind of obscurity goes you

1125
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,150
know when I was running it at my house

1126
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,450
it was running on my my isp provided IP

1127
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,830
address like I said which could have

1128
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,410
probably got me into some trouble

1129
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,840
depending on what they were doing so but

1130
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,580
other than that I didn't do anything to

1131
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,430
to obscure the one thing that I did do

1132
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,890
was I knew that my verizon aircard IP if

1133
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,680
they did any kind of geo location of the

1134
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,110
IP would come back to at the time i was

1135
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,470
living outside of pittsburgh so my my

1136
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,480
identity that i created i said i was

1137
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,220
from around Pittsburgh because I just

1138
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,810
wanted those two matchup that if they

1139
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,000
started looking that they wouldn't get

1140
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,609
curious because that IP didn't match

1141
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:28,560
so anything else yeah

1142
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:49,160
well yeah so they so I don't the way

1143
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,229
they operated I don't think they weren't

1144
00:50:51,229 --> 00:50:53,450
scanning internal IP addresses I never

1145
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,869
saw them look at RFC 1918 addresses so

1146
00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:00,170
even if they were and my box had one

1147
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,869
right because it was inside my it was

1148
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:04,069
inside my network who's behind the

1149
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:06,469
pfsense box so I never saw them probe

1150
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:09,739
outside of outside of that box they

1151
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:11,180
always went to the internet again I

1152
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,789
don't think these guys are they're

1153
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:15,499
following a script right there they're

1154
00:51:15,499 --> 00:51:17,499
they're just there they're trying to get

1155
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:20,839
the most boxes in the least amount of

1156
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,729
time right that's that's really seems to

1157
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:26,059
be what they're after I didn't do I mean

1158
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:28,519
they were allowed out on my network out

1159
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,950
80 and ftp right those those those

1160
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,059
weren't blocked I don't recall seeing a

1161
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,799
lot of traffic that way I mean they seem

1162
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:38,690
to be the traffic that I saw going out

1163
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,219
80 was the W gets they were fetching

1164
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:43,099
files to see you know their files that

1165
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,299
and then testing the speed of the

1166
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:52,279
network ya know so so I didn't write

1167
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,559
right I didn't let it run that long I

1168
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,599
would I would reboot the box and wipe it

1169
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,630
out so yeah that would be interesting to

1170
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,180
see to see I don't know how I would know

1171
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,219
when they when they sold it right that's

1172
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:05,779
that would be the only problem of but

1173
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:06,979
yeah it would be interesting to see

1174
00:52:06,979 --> 00:52:11,239
where they what happens once it's sold

1175
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:14,049
again my suspicion is it's it's spam

1176
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,039
because that seems like that would be

1177
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,559
the biggest bang for the buck you know

1178
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,599
and you can blast away a ton of spam and

1179
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,219
then it gets blacklisted and you don't

1180
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:24,289
care because you know because it's not

1181
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:25,579
your box you just move on to the next

1182
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:30,609
the next compromise toast yeah

1183
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,789
so no they were almost always smart

1184
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,289
enough there were some Romanian IPS that

1185
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:39,200
so that the UDP dos attack that I showed

1186
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,240
you that was one of them attacking

1187
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,690
another one of them so and I did see

1188
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,549
some of that there was kind of there was

1189
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:48,160
some drawing back and forth and you

1190
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,019
would see people get blasted off IRC so

1191
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:53,089
they were attacking each other but they

1192
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:57,619
almost always used a jump host to to

1193
00:52:57,619 --> 00:52:59,089
attack you know again well as soon as

1194
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:00,529
they compromised my box they started

1195
00:53:00,529 --> 00:53:02,240
using it to scan for other things so

1196
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,250
they seemed smart enough to not have it

1197
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,529
tracked back to where they to where they

1198
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:11,690
were and again a lot of Chinese IPS and

1199
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,779
I can't I can't really explain why

1200
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:16,849
because when I did it in my house I

1201
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:18,440
didn't see it was there were a lot of

1202
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,029
Chinese ip's but it wasn't exclusively

1203
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:21,829
Chinese IPS but when I was looking at

1204
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:23,690
the other boxes it was so heavily

1205
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,450
towards Chinese IPS that I can't really

1206
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,200
explain why why the difference unless

1207
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,609
it's a different group right I mean

1208
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:34,400
because I don't know on those kippo

1209
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,130
boxes where they were really coming from

1210
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,380
because I didn't have the same the same

1211
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,359
kind of packet capture so it is possible

1212
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:47,259
that it was a different group yeah

1213
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:50,630
oh they get come with a bad password

1214
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,239
like that it within hours it was

1215
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:57,410
compromised I mean within hours so I

1216
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,999
mean I don't know if you if you run I

1217
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:00,259
mean all you have to do if you run any

1218
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:02,329
Linux box on the internet with an open

1219
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:04,039
ssh port if you look at your logs

1220
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,319
they're hitting you all the time all the

1221
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,660
time if you if you look at that log

1222
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,729
they're just banging away constantly on

1223
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:16,009
ssh so I mean it doesn't take long with

1224
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:18,499
a bad password I'm sure it you know I

1225
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:19,880
don't know where one two three four five

1226
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,269
sixes and their list but you know I'm

1227
00:54:23,269 --> 00:54:24,410
sure if you put password it would be

1228
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,640
even quicker right because they would

1229
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,140
just would just cut it down a little bit

1230
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:31,150
on how long it took them to get there I

1231
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:34,670
don't know one two three four five six

1232
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,940
is such a horrible password but it but I

1233
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,920
don't know but but again with the Linux

1234
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,259
box it was a full on linux box like they

1235
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:44,390
could they could compile they could

1236
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,410
you know they could do whatever they

1237
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,049
wanted to do on that box so it wasn't

1238
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:49,579
like the capo box where they could where

1239
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:51,229
they could where they had easy ways to

1240
00:54:51,229 --> 00:54:55,190
tell that it was a honeypot anything

1241
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:04,729
else so I have tried to get some

1242
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:07,369
interest in different employers in honey

1243
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:12,109
pots at a previous employer we had a

1244
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:15,019
proof of concept that might still be

1245
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:23,390
running I don't know it the suspicion

1246
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,099
was that we would see more than we

1247
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:29,299
actually did so the bad thing about that

1248
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:31,339
is they people kind of lose interest in

1249
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:32,210
it because they're like well why are we

1250
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,229
doing this if we're not really seeing

1251
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:36,950
anything off of it right so and again

1252
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,839
it's a you know deploying an

1253
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,640
intentionally vulnerable box so in that

1254
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,519
case I actually used I used honey d and

1255
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,660
had it mimic an XP box and now in that

1256
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,309
case all I did was offer XP like

1257
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:50,749
services it does that kind of low

1258
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:53,690
interaction where it looks like XP but

1259
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,039
once they actually try to do something

1260
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,510
to it it won't let them go any further

1261
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:03,520
and but we didn't see a lot of we didn't

1262
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,400
see a lot of traffic the most of the

1263
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,900
traffic we saw was legitimate it was

1264
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,750
some asset inventory stuff like sweeping

1265
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,210
every IP address and it would trip the

1266
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,830
honey pot in honey powder I got a hit

1267
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,020
and it was just asset inventory looking

1268
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,670
for stuff so but I haven't given up on

1269
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,640
that idea so I'm hoping that there's an

1270
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,730
opportunity in my new position to kind

1271
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:35,710
of revisit that with time no that's what

1272
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,780
I'm they weren't they were command and

1273
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,260
control mech bot they were completely

1274
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,850
again I think these guys were just

1275
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,980
following a script they had a set of

1276
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,360
tools they didn't really think about

1277
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,190
what they were doing that because they

1278
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,010
were just kids 16 years old I mean I

1279
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,390
take him at his word he seemed to be

1280
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:57,430
honest they were just yeah true your

1281
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,800
true you're right you're right it could

1282
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,180
be I mean your abs you're absolutely

1283
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:07,480
right and so yeah so they just seem like
