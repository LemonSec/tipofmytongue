1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,799
hi everyone and thank you for joining me

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,120
in the missing piece of cloud security

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
now to be honest with you it actually

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,599
took me a moment to come up with what

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,120
picture i was going to use for this

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
because if you look at it right it's

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,359
this beautiful you know just day and

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,720
you're gonna go out and you're like wow

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,680
blue skies and how many of you would go

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920
wait a minute like what happened to the

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,960
clouds

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
yeah that's how dorky i am and that's

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,080
just how dorky this is going to be so i

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,079
hope you enjoy this ride i guess i

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,600
should go ahead and introduce myself

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,840
though my name is el marquez and i am

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
the linux and security advocate at

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,680
innozure now i know that's a bit of a

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
weird title people are always like you

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
do what now and maybe it's unique but i

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,559
love my position because what i do is i

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,320
work with our research team and my

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
friends who are researchers and

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
companies which we collaborate with

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,760
basically any researcher who's willing

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
to sit down with me and i dig into their

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,280
findings what are you working on what

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
did you find and then i just keep asking

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,359
questions what does that actually mean

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,879
how does it relate to what we're doing

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
how does it relate to and more and more

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,960
questions until i'm able to refine it

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,439
into information that's easy to share

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,159
but actually has actionable steps that

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
you can take and implement into your

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,439
environments implement into your

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,600
companies to increase your security

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,720
posture it's a lot of fun and along with

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
that i am an advocate for hacking is not

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
a crime so you always hear me say cyber

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
criminal not hacker we're all hackers

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,759
we're all having fun with this and

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,280
inventing new things

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
and one thing that i'm very proud of is

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
that i'm an advocate for operation safe

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
escape we're a 501c3 helping victims of

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
domestic violence who are being targeted

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
by their abusers with the use of tech so

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
if you or someone you know is in this

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
situation please reach out and know that

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
you're not alone

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
okay let's take a deep breath after that

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
and go on to our agenda

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
okay so our agenda today is going to be

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,399
a bit long but you know what all of this

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,159
is important and so first we're going to

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
start out with cloud compute security

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
challenges then we're going to talk

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
about security challenges when it comes

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,318
to the cloud providers themselves then

61
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,840
we're going to go beyond the abstract

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
you're not really here to hear a lot of

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
theoretical and it could be and it has

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
been you're here to find out like what

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
is happening now then of course we'll

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
have the big reveal i mean that's why

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
you're all here for right then like i

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,160
said i'm gonna finish off with actual

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
actionable security suggestions for you

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,160
and suggestions i mean go and do this

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
then i'll wrap up with questions and

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
please feel free to ask them i am

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400
cramming in what could be four hours

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
worth of information trying to condense

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
it down and don't be afraid of asking

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,239
anything that's a technical deep dive

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,920
like i said before i work with

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
researchers if i don't know the answer i

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,920
can get them for you

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
let's get this party started with cloud

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,640
compute security challenges this is a

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,760
critical part of cloud security because

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
what is it that you're trying to protect

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
and if you tell me your environment i

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
can tell you you're already doing it

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,040
wrong it's like taking your car in for

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
maintenance because something isn't

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,239
working and the mechanic says okay what

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
are we working on today and you save the

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
car

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
and walk off that just leads to more

92
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,280
investigation more work and honestly

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
more than we can probably have time to

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
do so i ask you what is it that you're

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
protecting you're protecting your

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
workloads yeah you have firewalls and

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,599
you've got your environments that are

98
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,799
built out with you know different

99
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,400
availability zones of different if

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,319
you're worrying about protecting those

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
things then you're losing sight of the

102
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,720
big picture you're there to protect your

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,480
workloads your applications and your

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
customers data and these all happen

105
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
within your compute resources

106
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
but in order to understand what the

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
critical issues are here we actually

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,799
have to go back in time and we're going

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,200
back in time quite a ways we're going to

110
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,959
1985 and if we're one of the newbies in

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
tech you're going wow that might be

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,879
before i was born but okay 36 years ago

113
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040
we had the advent the release of windows

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,519
right windows was it was

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,799
what is the word i'm looking for it was

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,560
kind of just uh lord it was

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
groundbreaking right it brought

118
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
computing it brought computers to anyone

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,799
who really wanted to use them as it kind

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
of you know evolved it made it easier

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
for anyone to be able to use computing

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
powers it was put into schools it was

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,759
put into companies and so it became the

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
operating system that everyone was

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
familiar with

126
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
makes sense that now it's actually 85

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
percent of the market share you know in

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
2020.

129
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
let's go to linux though linux kernel

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
version 1 was released as a side project

131
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
in 1991. now i'm not talking linux the

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
operating system i'm talking linus wrote

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
a bunch of code threw it together met

134
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,120
his needs sent it out to a mailing list

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
and was like i don't know if this is

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
going to help anyone else but it's here

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
for you to use feel free to change it

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
feel free to do whatever you want with

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
it turns out people could use it and it

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
continued to grow but we didn't actually

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,039
get the first linux distribution until

142
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,400
slackware in 1993.

143
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,039
there is a big gap so when it comes to

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
computing and what people are familiar

145
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,120
with you know windows has this heavy

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
history where linux is still seen as the

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
little baby in the industry many people

148
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,320
aren't familiar working with it just a

149
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
side note though on how cool linux is

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
yeah i'm a linux user if you can't tell

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
you know yoda yeah yoda and all the new

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
movies he was created using linux just

153
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,520
throwing that out there

154
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,680
linux though really kind of got on

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
steroids to be honest and grew up and

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
really became a contender in the

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
operating system world when it came to

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
the cloud

159
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,560
oh i love this image if you ever meet me

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
in person ask me to see my tattoo it's

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
about this big and this wide and it's

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
this exact same image so i know if

163
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
you're hearing my dog bark i'm sorry

164
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
welcome to the pandemic now when it

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,919
comes to

166
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
linux in the cloud now in 2021 it makes

167
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,560
up

168
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,600
96.3 percent of the world's 1 million

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,800
top servers and 90 of cloud

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,120
infrastructure now i'm willing to go out

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
there and say you know what linux is the

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,759
cloud the cloud is linux when i heard

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,280
that over 50

174
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
of azure that's right windows

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
microsoft's cloud is actually running

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
linux we got to the point where we know

177
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,360
it's going to be hard to beat in fact uh

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
microsoft ceo steve ballmer and i'm

179
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
really hoping i'm saying that right is

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
said in 2001 linux is a cancer that

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
attaches itself to intellectual property

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,440
sense and everything that it touches

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
and no hard feelings there right

184
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
however as linux grew in popularity they

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,280
had to do

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
a bit of backtracking now this was

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
released in 2014

188
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
with microsoft's new ceo saying

189
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
microsoft loves linux

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
what does this have to do with compute

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
security there it is linux security is

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,520
cloud compute security without becoming

193
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
familiar with the linux operating system

194
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,880
it's going to become extremely difficult

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
to become comfortable in the cloud and

196
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
with people having more experience

197
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
within the windows environments that

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
transition is a stark one and with

199
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,360
companies going all in and just saying

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
all right workloads are now in cloud

201
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,400
we're doing this deployment now we're

202
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
doing this move now who's taking the

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
time to give the security teams the

204
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,120
developers teams their ops teams the

205
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
training that they need in order to be

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
able to secure these environments better

207
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
there's a lot of visibility missing when

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
it comes to the actual planning of it

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
we're just kind of thrown into the deep

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
end and said hey secure it

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,240
there's

212
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
big issues here big holes that really

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
need to be addressed but that's not even

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
i guess the biggest hole that i'm seeing

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
uh kind of the biggest issue but not the

216
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
biggest hole because

217
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
what do we think about cloud provider

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
security challenges like when is the

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
last time you invited your cloud

220
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,759
provider to have a nice cup of tea sit

221
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,919
down and talk about their security

222
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
posture what is it that they're doing to

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
keep you safe hey have you been breached

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
recently what did you do about that

225
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
breach you know azure what did you do

226
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
about that reach google cloud i'm gonna

227
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
pick on the top three just because it's

228
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,319
easier than going after the small you

229
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,240
know cloud companies we're hoping that

230
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
you know they take off well so i'm not

231
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
gonna pick on them too much

232
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
the issue is that the cloud itself is

233
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
ephemeral by nature and so it's

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,599
constantly changing they're constantly

235
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,759
new servers and new providers out there

236
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
they've got their own release cycles

237
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,519
they've got you know oh this is the new

238
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,559
hotness you know we're going to

239
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
introduce this and it's going to take

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
this service away from here and once

241
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
again you're losing the insight to

242
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,200
what's actually occurring and without

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,040
having these conversations without

244
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
understanding what the cloud provider is

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
actually offering you how can you even

246
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
say that you have security posture and

247
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
the one thing i always get is they're

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
like oh you're making too big of a deal

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
with this this is a really simple answer

250
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,800
i mean they even make a chart for it who

251
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,200
hasn't heard of the cloud responsibility

252
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
model

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
simple right aws google cloud whatever

254
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
picking on them because they made this

255
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,080
image aws protects is responsible for

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
the actual protection of the cloud and

257
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
you're responsible for everything in the

258
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,680
cloud

259
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
that's it right it's really easy to

260
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
understand i mean when it comes to the

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,279
operating system well that's obviously

262
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,360
like in the cloud right so that's me but

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
if it comes to storage and databases

264
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
that makes up the cloud so that's them

265
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
but what if i'm running my yep hold on

266
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,959
it actually does get confusing and what

267
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,519
i end up referring to this if this is

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,240
how you believe that your security is

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
your security agreement is with your

270
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
cloud provider i end up calling this the

271
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
cloud irresponsibility model because

272
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,760
it's an extremely irresponsible stance

273
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,399
to have i want to know i did not coin

274
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,720
this term and if you know who did

275
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
if you know who coined it there you go

276
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
please let me know like i would love to

277
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
give proper attribution the reason that

278
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,200
it gets confusing is hey then we have

279
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,519
all our as models right um there's a

280
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,880
joke to be made there that i hope that

281
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,079
you all got

282
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,600
there's you know infrastructure as a

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
service which tends to line up more with

284
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
that right we've got our virtualization

285
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,760
and then we're in charge of our os and

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
our middleware but wait there's also a

287
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
platform as a service which means they

288
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,560
then have the operating system in the

289
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
runtime but but i thought i controlled

290
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
what was in the cloud and then they have

291
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,240
software as a service where they just

292
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
own everything and what if my i'm going

293
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,120
to pick on marketing i pick on a lot of

294
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,560
different teams hopefully everybody just

295
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,399
has fun with it but big on marketing

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
marketing is using all software as a

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
services you know they're using google

298
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
they're using or yeah they're using

299
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
gmail they're using dropbox they're

300
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,000
using asana and then our developers are

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
really doing quick deployments and

302
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
they're using a lot of platform as a

303
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
service and we also have a lot of our

304
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
infrastructure as a service running you

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
know some of our antiquated or

306
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
older applications

307
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
yo security team what are you protecting

308
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
like do you know exactly where all of

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
your assets are what teams are using

310
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
what what you should be monitoring

311
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,399
what's the most important thing to be

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,680
monitoring you know hey we've got

313
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
security campaigns that are running for

314
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
marketing but at the same time we need

315
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,959
to do security checks for our developers

316
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
as they have their deployment cycles and

317
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
who's still using this old server that

318
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
we have set up over here that we paid

319
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,839
for should we even be monitoring it

320
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
i'm running out of breath and probably

321
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
speaking too loudly because it does get

322
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,240
very overwhelming when it comes to

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
actual practice of it i've spoken to a

324
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,560
lot of different companies i've done a

325
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,600
lot of lunch and learns and

326
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
presentations like this where i ask the

327
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,720
question

328
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,760
do you actually know every single thing

329
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
that's on your system every single thing

330
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
that's in your environment in your cloud

331
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
in your hybrid cloud and i get a lot of

332
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
just smiles and nods and no i have one

333
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
guy that told me that he did and then he

334
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
also told me that they're only running

335
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
about three servers so you know what

336
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,279
fair

337
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,560
if you have a much wider environment out

338
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,320
there and you can tell me that you know

339
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
every single thing that's there every

340
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
single thing that's running in it

341
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
i'd really challenge you to go back and

342
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,560
take a second look in a second thought

343
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,399
about this

344
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,279
okay

345
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
so we also need to remember that relying

346
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
on the cloud security model or relying

347
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,639
on the cloud providers really isn't

348
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
enough but with everything that i just

349
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
said we have 78 of organizations saying

350
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
that they're really unsure where their

351
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
security responsibilities fall

352
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,160
most importantly and you know if you're

353
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,000
off doing something else like listen to

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,120
the spot

355
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
the buck stops with you if i am trusting

356
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,079
you with my information and you're

357
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,560
breached and it's out there i don't care

358
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,399
what cloud provider you were using i

359
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
don't care that it was their fault i

360
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,120
care that i trusted you with my

361
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
information and now because of what you

362
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,920
did it's out there this is a lot of

363
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
responsibility for security teams i mean

364
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
if an application gets breached really

365
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
where does the buck stop do they go

366
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
developers how could you have let this

367
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,519
happen or they do they say security what

368
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
happened why did you allow this attack

369
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
to occur why did you allow allow this

370
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
attack to be successful

371
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,600
then like i said we have the hybrid

372
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
cloud deployments

373
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
security products when it comes to the

374
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,839
cloud are constantly shifting so if you

375
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,440
have you know a little bit like i don't

376
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
know your containers inside of gks and

377
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
google because that would be the

378
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
simplest and i have my aws ec2 web

379
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,480
servers running and i've got my cloud

380
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
you know um actual databases on-prem and

381
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
you're doing something else with azure

382
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
you know i don't really use azure often

383
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
how are you matching up your security

384
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,480
services like if google offers one

385
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
service with a b and c are you sure that

386
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,519
the other two providers do as well or

387
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,600
are there two services that you need to

388
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
be relying with and have you configured

389
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,199
those correctly have you had the

390
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,720
conversations

391
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
there's a lot of just darkness a lot of

392
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
unknowns when it comes to having uh your

393
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
reply you're only relying on the cloud

394
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
providers and i've already spoken about

395
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,199
some of these right you have your rapid

396
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
deployments that are we actually keeping

397
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
up with the tools as quickly as our

398
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
developers are needing to change

399
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
environments developers i love you i'm

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
not picking on you i understand that

401
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
there is a lot of this that's just being

402
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,720
put on you

403
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,040
and then we hit containers all right now

404
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
we've gone from rapid deployments of

405
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
every few minutes to every few seconds

406
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
inside of the environments that are

407
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
deploying every few minutes

408
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,880
i don't know about you but honestly i

409
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
don't know how most people do it because

410
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
i end up feeling or ended up feeling

411
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
when i was doing all this insanely

412
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
overworked like i was just under a

413
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,680
mountain that i'd never get past

414
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
one thing that people do not think about

415
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
and you seriously need to know this and

416
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,440
think about it and put it in your plans

417
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
is the fact that cloud providers they're

418
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
being targeted as well the department of

419
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
homeland security cissa i forget all the

420
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,399
acronyms basically big security um big

421
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,160
security organizations within the u.s

422
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
government as well as some within the

423
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,839
australian government and all right i'm

424
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
not going to dig into every country

425
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
governments are letting you know

426
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,839
starting in 2014

427
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,920
that they are seeing advanced persistent

428
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,199
threats specifically target msps

429
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,160
it's gone as far as in 2021 september

430
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,079
3rd and i'm going to have a resource

431
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,680
page up i'll share this with the

432
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
organizers put it on my slides it's lo

433
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,519
punk slash b-sides you know uh lord i

434
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
forgot for a minute slash b-side to

435
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
charlotte i don't know where i am these

436
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,880
days uh we'll get it to the organizers

437
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,600
anyways i will have links to the actual

438
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,079
product to the actual um

439
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,639
documents that are out there sorry okay

440
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,759
so they're putting out all this

441
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,720
documentation and all of these notices

442
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
that say right september 3rd hey it's

443
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,720
not they are targeting it's they have

444
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
targeted they have been successful this

445
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
is what you need to do we're going to

446
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
see the growth of this one thing that

447
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
has changed because of this is now we're

448
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
seeing advanced persistent threats

449
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
becoming less specific like i am

450
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,959
targeting only company a they get into

451
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,680
the msp they get company a but hey you

452
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
know what here's a crime of opportunity

453
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,079
because i have company b company c so

454
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,440
even if you don't think you are a

455
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
company that would become that target

456
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,480
you could just become a you know

457
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
a target of just availability of

458
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,639
opportunity so you need to have that in

459
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,600
mind

460
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,920
all right we're about 15 minutes in at

461
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
this point if my

462
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
ability to rehearse this accounts for

463
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,000
anything you're probably going okay a

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,360
lot of theoretical hopefully you're

465
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
saying some good information but back

466
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,079
this up like what are you actually

467
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
seeing when it comes to research and you

468
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,680
know attacks

469
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,160
so let's go into the attacks

470
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
one of the attacks that's currently

471
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,560
really in the news and really making

472
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,279
headlines right now is cloud snooper now

473
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,360
cloud snooper was actually detected by

474
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
sofo so great work on their researchers

475
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,760
and they did it while they were

476
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
investigating malware that had you know

477
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
basically a malwa infestation i'm gonna

478
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,720
go with that on um cloud infrastructure

479
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
that was hosted on aws like this is not

480
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
aws specific though i need you to

481
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
understand this it could happen on any

482
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
cloud it could happen on your openstack

483
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,160
build that's on prem so don't tune me

484
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
out if you're just you know going like

485
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
oh i don't use aws

486
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
this was an extremely sophisticated

487
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,679
attack that was employing unique

488
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
combinations of techniques that like

489
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
they hadn't seen before it enabled them

490
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,039
to evade detection and really provided

491
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,640
the ability for the malware on the

492
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
system to be able to communicate freely

493
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,880
the issue here is that the servers that

494
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
it was able to compromise and was

495
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,039
working within were properly secured the

496
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
firewall rules were great the uh

497
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,000
security groups around them were great

498
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,960
and i love how sophos explains all of

499
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
this because they explain it to me

500
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
literally like i'm five

501
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,760
all right so

502
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
i'm not gonna walk through all of this

503
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,200
i'll make it you know available for you

504
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
but it's entertaining enough that i'd

505
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
like to spend a little time on it so

506
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,400
we've got our castle right our castle is

507
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
our environment it's fortified it's all

508
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
around our web server the image is over

509
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
here if you see me looking at it every

510
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
once in a while

511
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
and we have both of our nights there

512
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
right and their nights are going to be

513
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
our firewall rules they're configured

514
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,120
they're ready you see the closed ports

515
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
the gates they are ensuring that only

516
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,520
the sheep the http packets are coming in

517
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
but there's something scary here right

518
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,039
look there is a wolf in sheep's clothing

519
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,440
like this isn't going well and inside

520
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,840
the castle there's already a root kit

521
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,000
installed there's already a back door

522
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
that has been taken advantage of goes to

523
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
the concept that you should always

524
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,600
assume breach we can build all of the

525
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,240
walls that we want to but at times we're

526
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
just building a wall around the attacker

527
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
that has already gone into our system

528
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,720
then you know what the c2 traffic is

529
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
able to

530
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
throw off its wolf you know its clothing

531
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,360
show its actual face of being a wolf and

532
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
run away with our sensitive data and you

533
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,559
see that at the bottom with the little

534
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
wolf that says exfiltration running away

535
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,280
with his uh with his two chickens

536
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,039
i love learning like this hopefully you

537
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
look at this and can just kind of go

538
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
through it and you know becomes granular

539
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
away from my comics i enjoy this way too

540
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,679
much

541
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,640
let's go into the actual code itself now

542
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,480
when i started looking at the cloud

543
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,720
snooper malware and believe it or not my

544
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
company actually trusts me to play with

545
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,320
real malware i don't know what's wrong

546
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
with them um i was able to see two

547
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
different variants that i had abilities

548
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,200
to look into one was detected and found

549
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,240
and uploaded in february 26th and if you

550
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,679
look at the very end of it i should have

551
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,679
highlighted these you see that when it

552
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,120
was run through virustotal only 17 out

553
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
of the 58 search engines were actually

554
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
able to detect it now this was after it

555
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
already been made public this was after

556
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,559
you know we'd already had news story

557
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,480
yara rules were released like this

558
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
should have been something that we were

559
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
prepared for however that traditional

560
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,720
endpoint protection those traditional

561
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
anti-virus programs that we've been used

562
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,840
to using on-prem are not transitioning

563
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,559
well when it comes to cloud environments

564
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,039
and then we go up to april 4th right

565
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,440
that's a bit of time well you know what

566
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
if you look a little closer the shot has

567
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
changed and that's because you know like

568
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
attackers they know what they're doing

569
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,559
they know when something has been

570
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,080
released that we're going to start

571
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
looking for it specifically so they

572
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
start manipulating their code they start

573
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
changing things in order to be able to

574
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,799
bypass our abnorma abnormally or

575
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,799
signature based detection so i'm going

576
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
to dig in a little bit deeper and you

577
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
see my first one that i looked at was

578
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,679
cloud snooper and malicious libraries

579
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,360
okay i mean it's what you would expect

580
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
like 97 of the code was written to do

581
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,000
what we expect in cloud snooper and

582
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
obviously they're going to implement

583
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,799
malicious libraries i mean they're not

584
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
going to write every single thing from

585
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
scratch like developers i love you all

586
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
but we're lazy right they're our friend

587
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
developers back-end developers and stack

588
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,919
overflow developers as corey quinn likes

589
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,559
to say we reuse code whenever we can

590
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
then i went in and looked a little bit

591
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,880
deeper into the next piece of malware

592
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
that i had access to we start saying new

593
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,080
things implemented like recovey i never

594
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,679
say any of these things right

595
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,080
functionalities from the code that had

596
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,120
made recovery successful were being

597
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,080
brought into the cloud snooper code this

598
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,600
is something that they're able to do in

599
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,120
order to make their malware more

600
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
effective

601
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,480
make it be able to target a specific

602
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
target in the way that they want to so

603
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
it's not just prey and spray it's this

604
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
is the angle that i want with target a

605
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
therefore i'm going to bring in specific

606
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
attributions and specific abilities that

607
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
i want to

608
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,120
okay

609
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
so there is a brand new thing that we

610
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,960
need to be aware of right custom made

611
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,559
even with a little bit of

612
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,679
code borrowed um malware specifically

613
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,159
designed for the cloud but we don't even

614
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,240
have to go that advanced it doesn't have

615
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
to be that unique because one of the

616
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,200
biggest issues if not the biggest issues

617
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
when it comes to compromise is it

618
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,840
happens because of misconfigurations to

619
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,520
the point where and i believe this was

620
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
gartner i will look up the source and

621
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,039
ensure that i cite it correctly on our

622
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,640
resource page that 99 of s cloud

623
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,679
security failures through 2025

624
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,960
will be because of the customer's

625
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,640
mis-configuration like we we're human we

626
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,080
are fallible we make mistakes and yes

627
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,400
even security professionals you're high

628
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,039
level you're insanely well paid you're

629
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,600
like you know gurus of security they

630
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,640
make mistakes too i we had what i would

631
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
hope is to be some very strong very able

632
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,640
very intelligent cloud security and

633
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
security professionals that worked for

634
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
the pentagon

635
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,559
release a hundred gigabytes of data now

636
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,799
this data was compiled from a joint

637
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
intelligence program between the

638
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,640
us army and the national security agency

639
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,159
might have been some important things

640
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,400
there to protect and you might say okay

641
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,159
mistakes were made it was available for

642
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,520
one an hour a day a week yeah it was

643
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,400
several years that this was available on

644
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
a way that we're seeing

645
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
attacks kind of change because of this

646
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,600
really targeting that misconfiguration

647
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,840
is one of the malware that's actually my

648
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
favorite to show because it's

649
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
actually not that difficult for the

650
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,720
attacker to do see this malware was

651
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,919
called docking

652
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,200
and docky is specifically targeting

653
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
docker containers or

654
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
lord is targeting docker containers in

655
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,400
environments that have open docker api

656
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
ports now when it was discovered it

657
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,120
actually had zero percent detection on

658
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,760
virus total and at this point having

659
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,279
worked in this field long enough and

660
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,520
talking to researchers like that doesn't

661
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,919
even make me blink at that point one

662
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,679
percent zero percent

663
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,440
to me that's the norm that's what i'm

664
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
seeing all the time and that should

665
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
scare you so much if you're relying on

666
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
those you know endpoint protection the

667
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,799
traditional anti-virus and i keep

668
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
telling you that it has zero detection

669
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
or 32 out of 58 after months that it's

670
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
been out there

671
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,120
that's a wake-up call for you when it

672
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
comes to your cloud environments

673
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,080
now

674
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
one of the cooler things that docky did

675
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
i keep i mean like okay look it's bad

676
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
that they're compromising it's bad what

677
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
they do but if you're looking at the

678
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,919
code in the abilities it's pretty cool

679
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,480
and that's because it was able to bypass

680
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,880
all pre-run time scans right all your

681
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
container scans all your image scans

682
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,080
because there was

683
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,840
absolutely nothing malicious with the

684
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,640
image itself it was all perfectly well

685
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
and good what it did though is once it

686
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,760
was launched onto a victim server it was

687
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,039
able to use the curl command now look as

688
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,640
an admin i can tell you curl was

689
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,559
probably used daily in order to help

690
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,400
troubleshoot so it's going to be on a

691
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
majority of servers and it called out to

692
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,480
its

693
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,200
c2 servers and it pulled down the

694
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,279
malicious content the malicious packages

695
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
that were enabling it to actually break

696
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
out of the container and own the host

697
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,159
all of this happened in the matter of

698
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,400
seconds can you actually say that you as

699
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,159
a security team would have the

700
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,640
visibility in the moment to see that one

701
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
container go up go down and

702
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,240
be gone like we are so overwhelmed with

703
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
the amount of environments that we have

704
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
with the amount of deployments that are

705
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,039
happening and changing because of this

706
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,760
new cloud infrastructure that

707
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,400
we have some protection for containers

708
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
like we know what's going into them we

709
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
have our pre-run scans we're looking at

710
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,039
the code

711
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,960
but it's not enough it's not enough

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
visibility into what's occurring for us

713
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,559
to be able to do our jobs properly now

714
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
because you know we found dakia i had a

715
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
few more samples that i was able to play

716
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
with and like let's take a look at this

717
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,760
one right it's from january 14th this is

718
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
the best detection rate that we could

719
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,120
have gotten if you look at the others

720
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,200
right we're at 32 out of 58 of these now

721
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,919
i re-ran this scan two days ago i'm

722
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,200
recording this on the 14th two days ago

723
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
and

724
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
okay and we got better like we have a

725
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
few more

726
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,400
that was over a year ago this

727
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
information has been out there we

728
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
haven't kept it you know secret we've

729
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
sent out the our rules and you know

730
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
signatures and indicators of compromise

731
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,559
to everyone that we can and we're still

732
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,120
looking at this low detection rate

733
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
once again i mean am i setting off the

734
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,240
alarms for you on how security needs to

735
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
change when it comes to the cloud

736
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,360
environments if not let's look at things

737
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,039
by the numbers

738
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,600
in 2020 we saw an increase of 40 percent

739
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
new linux malware variants new linux

740
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,039
malware i apologize for using 2020

741
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,679
statistics we have yet to release 2021

742
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,440
and most organizations that i know of

743
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,279
haven't either so i can't even quote

744
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,880
other research teams

745
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,520
and between 2010 to 2020 we saw a

746
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,240
500

747
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
growth in linux malware

748
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,240
you'll be saying you know what like i

749
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
keep my systems up to date don't worry

750
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
every time there's a signature out there

751
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
i'm not one of those i've implemented it

752
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
our databases are as best as they can

753
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
get

754
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,120
really because there's about 560

755
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,080
000 new pieces of malware that are being

756
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,640
seen every day and you know what maybe

757
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,039
some malware is some days are more bad

758
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,039
some days are better some days are worse

759
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,880
some days the malware developers are you

760
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,279
know having a bit too much coffee but it

761
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,880
averages out to about 17 million new

762
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,279
pieces of malware each month

763
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,159
are you really updating all of your

764
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
security posture all your security

765
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
devices really your signatures and your

766
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,760
abnormally based detection to actually

767
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
look for all 17 million of these every

768
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,200
single month

769
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,080
i

770
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,919
really don't think so even if you told

771
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,320
me you were i'd still be hesitant to

772
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,840
believe it

773
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
we're about halfway through this i think

774
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,520
and so

775
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,000
it's time for the big reveal

776
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,279
yay all right

777
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,799
okay maybe i didn't need to go with this

778
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
ugly pink on blue i mean it's it's not a

779
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,640
gender reveal party

780
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,480
but on the plus side we are not going to

781
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,960
catch an entire forest on fire or any of

782
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,399
the other fun things we've seen on

783
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,039
youtube so i ask you

784
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,159
are you ready are you really ready

785
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,480
what is this missing piece

786
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
that to our cloud security i feel like i

787
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,039
should have a drum roll or something

788
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,080
but okay

789
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
i'm guessing if you were listening you

790
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,880
probably hopefully already know

791
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,200
and the missing piece is simply

792
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,120
visibility

793
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,760
hopefully you're not let down it really

794
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
that that's what's missing if you've

795
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,000
heard me go through all of this the

796
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,039
issues with visibility is we don't know

797
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,799
and to a certain degree sometimes we

798
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,120
don't even know what we should know and

799
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,320
it's extremely difficult to protect

800
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
something that's abstract you know i'm

801
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,559
going to protect myself from i'm going

802
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,240
to protect what's in the darkness even

803
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,200
though i don't know what i'm protecting

804
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
let's go into the concept of visibility

805
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
the big questions that you need to be

806
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,279
able to answer is first of all

807
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,880
what's in your cloud environment now

808
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
i've gone through that several times and

809
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,520
kind of made out a list but truly sit

810
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,399
down

811
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,640
find some time because this is extremely

812
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,960
important find you know whatever

813
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
application if that's what helps you

814
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,159
know obviously like i'm not going to

815
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,760
pitch my company but it's one of the

816
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,480
reasons that i know about this

817
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,279
is

818
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,679
you need to know not only what resources

819
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,679
that you have on it but you need to know

820
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,760
what is actually running on those

821
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,640
servers you know like hey i've got 2 000

822
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,600
ec2 instances are they all needed are

823
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
they all running code that we actively

824
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
need or did somebody just forget to

825
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,399
delete something

826
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
we have multiple cloud deployments for

827
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
an application that we used to run two

828
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,720
years ago that we deprecated and nobody

829
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,880
remembered because that developer or

830
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
that person left

831
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
then where is it running it was quite

832
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,720
interesting to talk to people and you

833
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,919
know say okay okay what are you

834
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,159
protecting whoever customers data law

835
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,640
where is it located it's located in

836
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,159
databases.l

837
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,760
okay but where is it located like where

838
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,279
do your databases reside it seems like

839
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,600
an obvious question but a lot of

840
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
security teams don't actually know they

841
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,399
rely on ops they rely on other sides of

842
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,159
the house to keep track of that they

843
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,039
just say i'm protecting our dbs

844
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,559
what if we had something that was

845
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,520
specific to a vendor that occurred for

846
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
example you know we recently hacked

847
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,760
azure functions if you didn't know that

848
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,720
your teams were using azure functions

849
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,480
maybe you wouldn't have been as

850
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,200
concerned about that and then you know

851
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,559
where is it being stored like um and

852
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,919
kind of that is you know where is it

853
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,840
running as well so just pull that in

854
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,760
together sorry and

855
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,159
who has access to it and who should have

856
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,760
access to it

857
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,919
once again these seem you know what

858
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,919
really help if i was pushing the button

859
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,080
so that you all could see this

860
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,039
so

861
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,880
this seems like an obvious statement

862
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,360
like yeah we know that that's obvious

863
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,279
but we're not doing it correctly i can

864
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,039
tell you that i worked for a major cloud

865
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,600
provider and i i was really lucky

866
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
hopefully i was doing well i was getting

867
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
promoted and moving around to teams

868
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,880
teams and i always got the permissions

869
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
that i needed to be able to do my job

870
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,840
i don't think i ever had any other

871
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
permissions taken away so even though i

872
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,159
was working perhaps on a completely

873
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,159
different side of the house i could

874
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,559
still log on to all my old accounts and

875
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,600
actually was

876
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,159
quite often asked to help other teams

877
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
you know it might have been helpful but

878
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,919
this is something that should not have

879
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,120
occurred

880
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,760
on top of that when i left the company

881
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
um i left on good terms you know

882
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,159
everything was good i hadn't signed out

883
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,320
of my company email and stuff on my

884
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
phone i still had access to it like

885
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,279
three days after i left

886
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,960
i'm the one that actually took it off my

887
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,799
phone so i don't know how long it you

888
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,720
know took for them to realize that i

889
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
still had access to something

890
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
what if i had been a disgruntled

891
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
employee what if i believed and just

892
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,640
kind of acted like i'd left on good

893
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840
terms yet still had access to everything

894
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,120
not only that but you know what

895
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
accidents happen it doesn't need to just

896
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
be a malicious actor that's having

897
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
access to it

898
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,519
um one thing that we saw and i don't

899
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,880
have it in my notes but i actually think

900
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,519
it's very interesting is uh malware by

901
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,159
the name of evil gnome and people kind

902
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,679
of get annoyed with me when i talk about

903
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,120
it because they're like it's not about

904
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,200
the cloud that is like completely

905
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,399
desktop based but as a linux admin and a

906
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,080
lot of the security people that i know

907
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,519
we run linux as part of our day-to-day

908
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,679
what if my system after i left because

909
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,519
i'm not you know working on best

910
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,600
practices but i did happen to use my

911
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,519
personal advice to get a device to get

912
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,480
into systems was compromised

913
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,360
like what if all of the information they

914
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,200
have because now they have the ability

915
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,000
to look at my screen to use my camera to

916
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,519
record things

917
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,320
all of this could be used in order for

918
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,640
somebody to take that information and

919
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
you know access

920
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
access the company later because my

921
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,960
device still has access to it hopefully

922
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
that made sense

923
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,679
and finally

924
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,679
what code is running on your system we

925
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,120
keep talking about you know what

926
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,519
applications and what are we doing

927
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,240
but

928
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,440
one thing that all you know effective

929
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,880
cyber attacks that are able to

930
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
compromise our environments and you know

931
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,440
exfiltrate data turn it into you know a

932
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,760
bot you know turn it into a crypto miner

933
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,960
share

934
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,480
they have to execute code like i know

935
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,279
that it's maybe an unpopular thing to

936
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,320
say

937
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,200
but you could have all of the back doors

938
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,079
that

939
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,359
you wanted and probably don't want it

940
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,879
but all the back doors in the world your

941
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,280
system could be you know just a cheese

942
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,399
grater at this point and if nobody ever

943
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,199
went into your system and executed any

944
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,800
code

945
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,879
does it really matter now i'm not

946
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,040
telling you to do this but we have to

947
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,520
understand what code is running on there

948
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,679
so we can understand is there actually

949
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
malicious code occurring like with cloud

950
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,800
snooper everything looked fine but

951
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
in the end things were happening that

952
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,879
shouldn't have and that was code within

953
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,480
the system

954
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,079
oh okay so let's go with it's all about

955
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,679
i couldn't help myself all right i wish

956
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,800
i could sing i really do because that's

957
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,119
what i want you to understand is it

958
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,359
doesn't even always have to be malicious

959
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,918
code it can be unauthorized code you

960
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,680
know we talking about living off the

961
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,119
land attacks

962
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,280
a lot of times people speak to these as

963
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,880
well that's what we're looking at when

964
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,200
we have things like abnormally abnormal

965
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,119
oh abnormally sorry

966
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,839
anomaly based detection which i guess

967
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,680
technically fits with that you know

968
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,920
we're looking for patterns that

969
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,480
are things happening that shouldn't be

970
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,000
yes but

971
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,079
what if it might look right but then it

972
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,400
is it that's exactly what you saw when

973
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,599
it came to a cloud snooper and as i'm

974
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,359
talking i'm remembering new examples so

975
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,119
y'all just run with me but there was a

976
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,640
recent new piece of malware that was

977
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,680
found that was called red xor rexorb was

978
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,920
very successful because it was able to

979
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,359
hide itself as the polk kd demon

980
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,240
and

981
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
it was doing everything that you would

982
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,599
expect right it's running in the

983
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,000
background it has privileges it's

984
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
communicating out as one would expect

985
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,200
except it's also bringing in code that

986
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,760
it probably shouldn't it's executing

987
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,480
that code but it's behaving exactly the

988
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
way that you would expect that system to

989
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,599
look like

990
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,839
and so you need to understand you know

991
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,200
what if you see something that's a

992
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,119
living off the land attack

993
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,720
is it actually something that can be

994
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,040
trusted and you know what like

995
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,359
attackers aren't going to name things

996
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,119
like hey this is a minor this is

997
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,320
whatever

998
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
i just did this because it's easier for

999
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
me to show you but you need to see

1000
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,680
what's actually running on the system at

1001
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,640
that time if you do have an attack uh

1002
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,000
one of the biggest issues that we're

1003
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,079
having right now is things like fileless

1004
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,480
malware there is nothing on disk for us

1005
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,720
to be able to investigate what happens

1006
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,079
in the cloud you know we either windows

1007
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,680
the issue turn the server on turn it

1008
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,280
back off again and then we wipe

1009
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
everything out

1010
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
or in the cloud we have automation set

1011
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,119
up to you know what

1012
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
that server really isn't acting the way

1013
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,640
we want to just delete one and put it in

1014
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,560
its new place and this is even decision

1015
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,960
that we're making we're completely

1016
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
automating this process which makes it

1017
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,839
take even longer for us to actually see

1018
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,760
for us to have that visibility to

1019
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,680
there's actually an issue it's not until

1020
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
we've seen maybe the hundredth alert

1021
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,359
within a team or somebody's going like

1022
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,000
why do we keep getting these i know that

1023
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,680
at my i'm making the company i used to

1024
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,920
work at look horrible but i promise like

1025
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,760
it's across the board it's not just this

1026
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,839
one but we would get alerts like oh my

1027
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,680
god you know high cpu usage high

1028
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,320
procedure usage and it would clear out

1029
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
and we'd be like eh it's cleared

1030
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
whatever and we just move on it was

1031
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,800
until about like the 50th time you start

1032
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,040
going you start recognizing that server

1033
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,240
that you're going you know it cleared

1034
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,960
but i should probably look into this

1035
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,560
if they're hiding their

1036
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,480
attack correctly how long could that

1037
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,839
actually take how long could they

1038
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,200
already be in that system and have

1039
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,680
pivoted into other systems before you

1040
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
even realize that it's occurred

1041
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,640
okay

1042
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
i want to make sure to leave question

1043
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,599
time for questions so

1044
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,240
let's go to my actionable suggestions

1045
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,440
okay

1046
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,880
pat your systems

1047
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,760
yeah you know uh yeah patch your servers

1048
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,119
and some of you may be laughing going

1049
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,800
like really that's the advice we're

1050
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
gonna give you everybody gives that we

1051
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,200
know that

1052
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
if you know it and you've been told it

1053
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,160
before then why are we still being

1054
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,200
compromised almost on a daily basis for

1055
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,599
servers and environments that weren't

1056
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,240
patched it is not the cloud's

1057
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,960
responsibility to patch your stuff i

1058
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
wanted to say another word there you

1059
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,720
might have the agreement that is you

1060
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,040
might think that it is the buck stops

1061
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,119
with you make sure that those servers

1062
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,640
are patched make sure that they're up to

1063
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,560
date if they're not then you your

1064
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
developers your company

1065
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,480
need to have a serious conversation

1066
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
about this issue because i've heard oh

1067
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,240
well it can't be patched because it'll

1068
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
break this application and this is

1069
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,599
mission critical what i hear when you

1070
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,320
tell me that is this vulnerability is

1071
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,640
mission critical for our company to work

1072
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
when you phrase it like that do you see

1073
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,119
what the issue is there has to have

1074
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,359
serious conversations that occur not

1075
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,520
only on how we can mitigate this by you

1076
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,119
know updating the application in this

1077
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,880
long term what is our plan right now if

1078
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
we assume that there's already an

1079
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,000
attacker there or there's already an

1080
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,839
attacker specifically going for that

1081
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,040
resource

1082
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,240
patch your stuff

1083
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,800
that's where i'm going patch it patch it

1084
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,520
and patch all the things have i said

1085
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
that enough times

1086
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,119
uh when we spin up thing you know

1087
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,520
servers on in the cloud we're like okay

1088
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
hey it's a brand new image i just spun

1089
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,760
it up their image is obviously up to

1090
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,520
date because this is what they do for a

1091
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
living

1092
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
i spun up a web server and then i went

1093
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,800
looking for

1094
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,119
what the problems with it was yeah i had

1095
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,960
quite a few libraries that had critical

1096
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,760
cves and a lot of them on highs and i

1097
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,280
literally ran the scan within minutes of

1098
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,400
the server being up

1099
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
breathal

1100
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,040
all right here are your actual steps you

1101
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,960
need to assume breach

1102
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
the wolf is already in the castle you

1103
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,440
can build all the walls that you want

1104
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,079
and that's currently our strategy

1105
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,800
you need to go hunting you need to know

1106
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
what resources you are where are you

1107
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,880
hunting at you need to know what code is

1108
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
being used you know where are those

1109
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,319
wolves going what are their intents who

1110
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,319
are they hunting after you know are we

1111
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,000
are they hunting after i don't know deer

1112
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,560
or chicken whatever it's going to impact

1113
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,440
the way that you approach things and

1114
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,920
know your configurations it's not just

1115
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,640
all about the deployments it's not all

1116
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,880
on the developers we need to work

1117
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,839
together this fallacy of devsec ops

1118
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,000
needs to become reality

1119
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,720
i've sat down with teams before that

1120
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,119
have told me the decision is eventually

1121
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,599
made that either it's

1122
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,359
come to mark because we've said hey

1123
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,440
we're going to release this function on

1124
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,000
april 3rd april 2nd comes the code isn't

1125
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,119
quite there

1126
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,920
are we going to lose more money if we

1127
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,760
don't put out this function and fix it

1128
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,640
later in production than we would if we

1129
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,960
were compromised like these are

1130
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,599
budgetary decisions that are being made

1131
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,560
that should never have to be made

1132
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,319
i'm not saying not to do your pre-run

1133
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,000
time scanning i'm not saying don't do

1134
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
your firewalls i'm not saying do you use

1135
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,720
any version of you know antivirus i'm

1136
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,680
i'm not telling you to stop the good

1137
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,520
things that you're doing but i'm telling

1138
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,480
you to take a big look into those and

1139
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,800
see what else is missing

1140
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,760
but you don't have visibility into

1141
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,240
and finally my last suggestion and this

1142
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,079
might be the one that all of you love

1143
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,359
the most

1144
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,359
what's missing

1145
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,480
is really

1146
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,119
our abilities to keep up with what the

1147
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,520
company is looking for for us too and

1148
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,720
you're tired of hearing this but you're

1149
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,240
going to remember it for us to have

1150
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,800
visibility into what excuse my language

1151
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,400
i must go with hell what the hell we're

1152

1153
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,480

1154
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,319
we need to train our security

1155
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,240

1156

only the oh we have these resources

1160
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,280

1161
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,599
time to learning what it is that we're

1162
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,839
working with and at the same time to

1163
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,839
have the tools that we need to be

1164
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,200
