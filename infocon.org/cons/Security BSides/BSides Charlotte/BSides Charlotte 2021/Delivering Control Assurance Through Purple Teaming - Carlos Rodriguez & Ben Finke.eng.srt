Charlotte

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,800
uh today Saturday

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,540
uh and on track three of the conference

today we're going to talk about uh

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,260
attack simulation and purple teaming and

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,740
how you can use these techniques to

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,480
deliver control Assurance to your

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,939
management team

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,239
my name is Carlos Rodriguez I am the CEO

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,380
and founder of fractional ciso of ca2

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,440

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,079
security firm I have some products and

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,379
with me today I have a great partner uh

16

Ben thinker with uh on the fence I will

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
let Ben who by the way I forgot to put

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
here he is the founder of besides

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,260
Jacksonville

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,440
uh as well so very experienced in this

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,079
uh type of conferences so Ben what you

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,780
introduce yourself yeah go besides uh so

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,580
my name is Ben Fink I'm the co-founder

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,979
of a company called on defend and I uh

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,659
run development for a tool we call blind

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,400
spot that doesn't help a lot helps a lot

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,080
with the purple team Automation and some

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,520
of the other preaching attack simulation

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,560
that we'll be talking about today really

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,540
excited to be here

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
yeah and so man is more of the offensive

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,580
guys I call him he doesn't like that

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,000
when I call him that but I'm more yeah

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,520
is one of the nicest guys I've met but

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,580
I'm on the on the other side of my in my

36
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,259
background I've been more on the on the

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,020
sock managing sock delivering uh

38
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,720
security uh operation centers and

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,460
leading those and doing investigations

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,680
and instant response so

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
here we're coming together to become

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
purple

43
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,479
so real quick we'll start with one topic

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,520
that I run into a lot and

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,020
uh purple team exercises does run into

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,200
this as well which is all of these

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,579
different type of

48
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,239
cyber security test that all the

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,819
organizations have to deal with

50
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,580
um and they're all different and as are

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,319
the organizations so we have

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
vulnerability management which is

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,580
as you know basically

54
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,180
uh running scans to figure out what

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,860
exploits are available within your

56
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,500
environment without taking any action

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,560
just that understanding what you have

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,780
then you have the red team

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,599
side of the house which is more on the

60
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,160
offensive side it's more on the

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,040
attacking and using the ttp's uh

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
to

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,480
deliver payloads or or not payloads but

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,420
deliver simulated attacks and see what

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,120
they can they can do and you have blue

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,980
team which is under protection the the

67
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,319
instant response uh side of the house

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,440
they are the first respondent

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,300
for an incident

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,459
and then we're going to talk about

71
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,920
today's purple teaming is coming

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,400
together as a team to

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,560
work together and understand how to get

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,640
better

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,500
then we also have Rich and attack

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,319
simulation which are certain tools that

77
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,800
can be used to

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,440
simulate attacks without really dropping

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,980
any malware or payload

80
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,340
anything you want to add on this then

81
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,319
yeah I you know I'll say one of the

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,760
great things about purple team is it

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
brings into uh sharp relief the value of

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
a red team which is making the blue team

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,959
better

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,900
and that's it right and so by being able

87
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,700
to do that we get a chance for both of

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,620
those teams to work together with the

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,360
same objective of making the the

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,360
environment uh a little more resilient a

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,000
little easier to detect attackers and uh

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,440
I think what's great about purple team

93
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,940
is you can really scale it up or scale

94
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,980
it down uh to be what you mean it seems

95
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,840
like a really complicated subject and I

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,920
hope well part of what we're going to do

97
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,239
today is simplify

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,099
but it really can scale to meet a lot of

99
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,140
different needs and uh so I think people

100
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,580
get a lot of value at it they weren't

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,019
expecting

102
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,780
yeah and by the way there are many more

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,399
type of tests that we have to deal with

104
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,500
right we have application security

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,180
testing you know tabletops audits which

106
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,780
are some uh kind of tests too a

107
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,759
different type of tests but they are and

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,300
so you know we understand that uh there

109
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,220
is a lot going on here

110
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,460
um in in that world but I think our goal

111
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,639
like Ben said is how can we come

112
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,500
together and make each other better

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,340
right uh by by doing these exercises so

114
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,199
we'll start with a little bit of a

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,259
definition of what a purple team is and

116
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,639
according to

117
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,440
um

118
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,900
uh there's actually definition was on

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,540
sites uh purple team exercise framework

120
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,880
and it's an open engagement where the

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,639
tag activities is exposed and explained

122
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,220
to the blue team as it occurs

123
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,560
Oracle team exercises are Hands-On

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
keyboard exercises where red and blue

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,940
teams work together with an open

126
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,820
discussion about each attack technique

127
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,060
and defense expectation to improve

128
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,340
people process and technology in real

129
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,660
time so

130
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,620
all of this to me what it means is

131
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,320
collaboration that is that right Ben

132
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,720
yeah I mean it's really critical right

133
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,759
and and what what really makes it fun is

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,860
you know and other types of engagements

135
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,300
the red team does their work and then

136
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,680
it's like the blue team side and they

137
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
don't really communicate and that is

138
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,100
where we lose a lot of the fundamental

139
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,440
value that you gain by doing this kind

140
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
of exercise

141
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,000
yeah so the the red team in increment if

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm wrong Ben but the rip team rep team

143
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,919
is gonna use ttp's techniques uh uh

144
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,300
sorry Ben it escapes my mind the acronym

145
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,280
uh tactics techniques and procedure by

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,520
in for example miter uh attack framework

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,620
to

148
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,360
based on what they know about the

149
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,440
environment

150
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,880
deliver the the attack right while the

151
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,699
blue team is does need to understand

152
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,139
those ttps to protect to to hunt to

153
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,020
monitor to detect and that's kind of

154
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,080
that collaboration happening so some of

155
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,319
the things that uh differentiate from

156
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,740
other type of techniques and and testing

157
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,460
is

158
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,460
it is in red uh purple teaming more

159
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,800
strategic than than a pen test for

160
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,440
example then and why is that

161
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,539
I think that I would say that it what it

162
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,340
really helps you do is understand both

163
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,680
the capabilities of the security tools

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
that you're using that the blue team is

165
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,520
using to defend and the ability of that

166
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,500
team to use those tools right so often

167
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,900
you show up with a organization they

168
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,819
have a lot of really fancy expensive

169
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,319
tools and the team spends all day

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,120
getting pushed around by the tools as

171
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,819
opposed to using them uh to to you know

172
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,500
achieve the outcome they're looking for

173
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
and so I think one of the great outcomes

174
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,580
from a purple team is that you can stop

175
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,780
letting that happen you can start

176
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,979
figuring out like are these things

177
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,620
valuable to us or not and like really

178
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,940
figuring out like because the reason we

179
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,099
have these is to stop attackers in our

180
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,720
environment right that's it that's the

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,460
reason and so now we can see do they

182
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,620
actually do the job

183
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,220
yeah and and again that collaboration is

184
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,460
critical to understand what each other

185
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,440
is doing and have a dialogue during the

186
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,340
the engagement right I mentioned earlier

187
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,500
TDP is the same TDP that you agree upon

188
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,780
on during the planning phase which we're

189
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,060
gonna see later you're gonna use both

190
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,880
from a different angle right

191
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,620
um

192
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,419
the attackers or the red team are going

193
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,039
to try to exploit while the uh blue team

194
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,380
is going to try to

195
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,440
um defend and protect but during that

196
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,060
conversation

197
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,940
you know you are engaged in what are you

198
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,520
seeing what's happening in the at this

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,139
moment in time are you seeing anything

200
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,460
right at all so

201
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,900
to then like uh mention a few times that

202
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,879
the goal is that we all get better and

203
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,699
and we it's it's a training opportunity

204
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,000
to understand how we can get better in

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,820
our security depository yeah

206
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,539
yep so what are some of the benefits

207
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,580
again I'm gonna we're gonna talk about

208
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,140
sharing and dialogue and collaboration

209
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,180
throughout the exercise

210
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,279
um because that's what we're supposed to

211
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,740
be doing is sharing that knowledge

212
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,540
sharing the thread Intel

213
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,920
so that we can get better uh Ben want to

214
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,860
talk through this I do yeah yeah

215
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,380
um you know I think one of the the great

216
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,700
ideas here is like a lot of

217
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,140
organizations receive some type of

218
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,399
threat intelligence and I don't mean

219
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,320
lists of domains and IPS that are bad I

220
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,540
mean behavior-based things like we know

221
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,240
for example Conti ransomware likes their

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
initial payload does this activity right

223
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,040
it drops the dll and and you know

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,420
executes it and does a whole bunch of

225
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,279
other things like let's see what that

226
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,500
looks like right and um one of the great

227
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,060
things about a purple team exercise here

228
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,860
is we can take an individual element of

229
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,620
like a threat Intel report like say the

230
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,420
fact that a threat actor uses a

231
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,399
technique called kerberosting which is

232
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,720
something that happens all the time on

233
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,399
pen tests that organizations are

234
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,320
probably not well suited unless they

235
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,540
know how to do this themselves to figure

236
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,880
out can we detect this and how bad is it

237
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
for us and that is a great purpose of a

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,779
purple team exercise because you can see

239
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,399
it happening and then all these log

240
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,500
events get generated you're like oh all

241
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,940
of that because you did this one command

242
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,060
over here really valuable to know I also

243
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,060
like the idea of us being able to use

244
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,100
that as we develop detection

245
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,480
capabilities for more sophisticated

246
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,459
attacks when we run a purple team

247
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,080
exercise if it's with an organization

248
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
that's never done this before we almost

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,040
always end up having to turn on two or

250
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,540
three more data sources that we weren't

251
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,060
collecting before and the really great

252
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,200
news is now they've got a lot of

253
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
telemetry coming in we can work with and

254
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,680
even if it does even if an alert that we

255
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,260
build does it specifically it's you know

256
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,360
we don't specifically run that same

257
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,100
procedure that the real threat actor

258
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,720
does there's a good chance that they've

259
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,940
got the data available that they can

260
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,940
build behavior-based signatures from now

261
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,339
um and so that's that's a really great

262
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,899
um benefit of the purple teaming for

263
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,220
sure

264
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,839
yeah and that's uh the trading tell uh

265
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,860
we usually as part of that initial phase

266
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,320
correct uh Ben we're going to touch on

267
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,899
that later where really starting to tell

268
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,700
us specific to your environment correct

269
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,740
absolutely you know it doesn't do us any

270
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,540
good to practice a whole bunch of

271
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,180
Internet of Things Mirai botnet activity

272
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,740
if you don't have any Internet of things

273
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,560
you know on your network so it's really

274
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
important to take a look at what is

275
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,220
important for the organization that's

276
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,720
doing the purple team that's hat that

277
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,040
has the blue team

278
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,899
what is important to them what systems

279
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,760
do they use uh you know what industry

280
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,140
they're in what what are the likely

281
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,720
attackers they're going to deal with uh

282
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,180
and then let's simulate that or emulate

283
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,700
that yeah there is a lot of uh

284
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,240
preparation leading into the exercise

285
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,680
and what I've seen

286
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,180
um I'm going to kind of tell a story

287
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,180
also from the receipt from the Cecil

288
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,480
point of view when I I did this as a

289
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,339
customer one time

290
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,200
um but but at the end all this

291
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,540
collaboration one of one of the key

292
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,519
benefits is that

293
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,420
is that healthier environment in that

294
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,279
I'm not trying to beat you and show you

295
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,220
up all the time right yeah or not only

296
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,800
that but another key I think is

297
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,740
you know

298
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,480
red team sometimes comes in with a

299
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,720
report gives it to The Blue Team hey do

300
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,600
you guys have this capsicle fix it talk

301
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,920
to you later

302
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,380
where that's not what we do here right

303
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,300
that's not what we do here yeah in the

304
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,680
Consulting world we call that seagull

305
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,319
and Carlos yeah yeah exactly so buddy

306
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,220
yeah and and that you know from the

307
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,660
Cecil point of view from management

308
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,040
point of view

309
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,300
so I can once we have results and we

310
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,399
identify you know those gaps and work

311
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
together in into remediation I can also

312
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,360
provide Assurance to management on the

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
effectiveness of our controls and why

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,760
we're doing what we're doing and uh you

315
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,779
know continue to get better so we we

316
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,480
provide value the value of our

317
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,760
investments and that's that's key

318
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,060
because many times most of the time you

319
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,260
know Senior Management may not

320
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,540
understand why you're doing this well

321
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,060
again it's a big part of it is

322
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,940
delivering that assurance that controls

323
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,880
are are working the way they are

324
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
supposed to and when they are not we're

325
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
gonna get to it and fix them yeah I I

326
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,740
think that you hit on a major major

327
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,200
value of this right the outcome of the

328
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,820
purple team should be expressed in a way

329
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,920
that makes sense to people who are at

330
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,180
the stakeholder level where they really

331
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,120
are more interested in the money in

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,339
terms of either cost or risk avoidance

333
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,399
uh if you can do that then you've made a

334
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,380
monster Improvement in your ability to

335
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,300
get them to react the way you want them

336
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,220
to and either sign off on some

337
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,600
investment you're recommending whether

338
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,820
that's money or time or whatever if you

339
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,320
can convert that into this million

340
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,639
dollars we spent on this awesome thing

341
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,279
we found a black hat really only stops a

342
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,720
couple of things and so it's only worth

343
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,200
like 150 000 that is a bad Roi and that

344
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,940
will help you either get rid of it

345
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,560
or figure out how to make the full use

346
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,300
of that tool

347
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,560
right and that's a that was the message

348
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,920
I sent when we decided to do this so I

349
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,160
want to mention also here

350
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
purple teaming may not be for everybody

351
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,320
right uh Ben I mean it may be that

352
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,079
you're not mature enough or your red

353
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,940
team and blue teams are working just

354
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,139
fine and doing great so it's not

355
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,820
something that that you always have to

356
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,040
do right I I think that's right I think

357
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,839
I think if you have a healthy mature

358
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,459
blue team it's probably because you have

359
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,839
a healthy mature red team who does this

360
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,760
kind of activity I think what's more

361
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,740
likely is if you don't even do

362
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,940
vulnerability scanning on your

363
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,139
environment yet and you don't have a

364
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,160
good inventory

365
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,139
those are some foundational things you

366
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,579
probably want to work on first and then

367
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,899
we'll get to this as soon as you got

368
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,060
those things lined up right

369
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,920
um I think the I think the other side of

370
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,959
that uh you know to your point Carlos is

371
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,060
that some of these can get really big

372
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,160
and be like whole attack chain scenarios

373
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,279
which are fun to do having gotten a

374
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,320
chance to do a bunch of those uh but

375
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,500
those can take a long time to plan and

376
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,699
like it requires a lot of people it

377
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,199
requires a lot of time you can you can

378
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,120
do them in much smaller Snippets but I

379
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,060
do agree the there's probably like uh

380
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,040
people who try to go to purple team and

381
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,300
skip a lot of the foundational things

382
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,040
that well you're really going to need to

383
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,019
take advantage of these anyways

384
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,480
yeah and and in my case when I was a

385
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,899
corporate ciso internal C so in an

386
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,600
insurance company you know we had the

387
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,880
conversation and we'll touch on that in

388
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,720
the next slide in that

389
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,399
uh one of my security managers told me

390
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,620
well why why do we do this why do we

391
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,120
need to do this we have other things

392
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,240
areas that we need to improve first and

393
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,639
I said okay that's cool uh so we got

394
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,500
better in other areas when the time came

395
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,139
it was still overwhelming because we

396
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,820
were not a big team so the message is

397
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,139
here

398
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,720
you may be in that area where you're not

399
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,600
mature or you have a small team well you

400
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,279
don't have to do it all yourself either

401
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,500
there are consultant there are teams out

402
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,959
there that can help you with this and be

403
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,399
effective and that's what we did

404
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,019
actually when we saw the the cost and

405
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,880
the return that we will get

406
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,600
in the the rapid and the speed of the

407
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,240
improvements that we will be making it

408
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
was a no-brainer for us and so we went

409
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,860
uh with it we we had a good exercise

410
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,760
with one of our partners and uh that was

411
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,279
a one-time uh because that's what we

412
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,100
budgeted for for that year but then

413
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,980
guess what for the next year we budgeted

414
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,259
for like less of these more often

415
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,699
because that's one of the things that

416
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,060
you want to do right uh Ben is have some

417
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,720
frequency in how you do ideally yeah

418
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,420
when you do these exercises

419
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,680
I think we should definitely talk about

420
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,019
some of the best practices for purple TV

421
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,000
Carlos do you think that's a good topic

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
we should talk about uh absolutely so

423
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,040
what what will be some of those

424
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,139
so I really like the first one you have

425
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,399
here you definitely want to have

426
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,619
somebody who functions as like the

427
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,020
organizer of the Activity one of the

428
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,459
things that we see a lot of folks get

429
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,679
wrong about purple team is not having

430
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,299
enough of either red or blue on there

431
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,280
right we need enough of the red team

432
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,059
side to simulate or emulate the attacker

433
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,699
activity we're interested in we also

434
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,679
need the blue team folks who can

435
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,199
actually go log into the security tools

436
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
that potentially can monitor for that

437
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,460
stuff right and get that data we also

438
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,620
need to make sure that we are falling

439
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,660
into a useful scope and practice and

440
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,980
like going through some sort of a

441
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,720
Cadence of either how often do we repeat

442
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,700
it or what exactly we're going to cover

443
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,500
in this right what what is what is

444
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,720
interesting that we want to make sure we

445
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,100
talk about today is it is it making sure

446
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,380
that like the process we have for

447
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,020
responding to malware Works do we want

448
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,700
to make sure that we are set in case

449
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,380
somebody rolls in and decides to use a

450
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,240
whole bunch of Powershell techniques do

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,520
we want to know um you know that that we

452
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,520
have a uh working maybe managed security

453
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,320
service provider who we pay a lot of

454
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,240
money to every month to make sure that

455
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,340
if these alarms trip that they let us

456
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,620
know super super helpful to know how

457
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,760
long would it take for those things to

458
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,480
go

459
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,179
I think you also something that gets

460
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,760
lost a lot is what is the outcome of

461
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,080
this need to be right does it need to be

462
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,700
tracked as and this gets back to the

463
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,320
project manager they need to get tracked

464
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,660
as like things to fix is this a report

465
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,100
that's going to a stakeholder what are

466
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,179
they going to care about all that stuff

467
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,460
is super duper important

468
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,140
um in the planning which your third

469
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,059
bullet there is super super critical

470
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,200
right

471
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,340
um

472
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,140
I wouldn't get too nuts like everybody

473
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,179
again wants to dive into like ttps and

474
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,580
and targets and things uh I I would I

475
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,620
would say like those uh are important

476
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,059
but like unless you have everything else

477
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,380
ready you're not really ready to set

478
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,660
those up yet right one thing about ttps

479
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,039
is like there's so much great threat

480
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,600
Intel out there now that you can use to

481
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,039
pick things up

482
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,419
um and that's something that the red

483
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,400
team should really like once they

484
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,960
understand the concerns that the

485
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,100
organization have if they're a third

486
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,960
party red team that's really a lot of

487
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,220
value they can bring us here's the

488
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,140
things you should be worried about

489
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,280
um and so hopefully that's something if

490
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,320
you do engage in third party that that I

491
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,419
would expect them to be not just like oh

492
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,559
yeah here's things we know how to do

493
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,120
really well they should be like here's

494
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,059
threats that match your concern that

495
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,240
here's what we think you should do

496
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,860
right and and uh

497
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,660
you hit a good point there and not not

498
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
getting too waiting into the ttps and

499
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,039
whatnot

500
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,380
know that there are some Frameworks and

501
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,419
excuse me so hopefully some of you do

502
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,460
know that that you can use as your

503
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,320
guidance like miter attack I mentioned

504
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,660
earlier or uh there's another one that

505
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,179
and I remember the name of the the

506
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,160
guy that came up with it but it's like

507
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,220
the unify cyber kill change where he

508
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,320
kind of brought

509
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,980
the the miter and the Cyber kill change

510
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,380
and other Frameworks together to

511
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,660
simplify communication really to me

512
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,720
that's what it does for us uh so use

513
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,600
those guides to help you and don't go

514
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
too crazy I mean you can start very

515
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,039
basic with things that you have even

516
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,200
seen before in your environment and

517
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
started there I think one of the main

518
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,299
things here is that feedback continuous

519
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,179
feedback as you are looking into and

520
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,580
we'll see an example of that later as

521
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,059
you're looking into uh the results that

522
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,160
you're getting you have to have that

523
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,280
dialogue right uh to to Norm basically

524
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,160
normalize the data if you would then is

525
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,059
that correct

526
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,280
oh absolutely right and I think what's

527
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,900
really important is

528
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,039
um we're going to talk about probably

529
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,539
some things not to do here in just a

530
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,660
second but but I will say that uh that

531
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,940
transparency is super clear here like if

532
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,960
we're not

533
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,520
um being very helpful and actually

534
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,960
sharing this information like the

535
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,299
attacker showing the red team showing

536
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,460
their screen showing their work and the

537
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,080
same on The Blue Team side being willing

538
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,940
to pull up you know your sim dashboard

539
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,400
or your EDR console and be like I mean

540
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,260
this is the data I have

541
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,120
then then a lot of this doesn't work

542
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,919
yeah let's talk about those bad

543
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,419
practices though because well before

544
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,760
before before we get there I do have a

545
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,679
question for you and that is regarding

546
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,200
the would you touch early on on the

547
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,299
roles and responsibilities and and

548
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,200
having enough blue and red but there is

549
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,500
one area gray area I guess or purple

550
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,260
maybe where you're working with this

551
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,960
small team where they may not even have

552
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,200
uh security team to begin with sure so

553
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,900
the I.T or or it's just a one team

554
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,840
insecurity mostly focus on on Blue

555
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,720
that's I see that a lot so how how do

556
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,280
you manage that how do you work with

557
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,600
those type of environments because

558
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,880
that's basically most about the

559
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,880
environments right yeah yeah so if if

560
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,380
the constraint is that we don't have a

561
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,240
lot of team members so they can't be on

562
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,860
like a meeting all day long to do this

563
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,679
and I think the way you plan to do the

564
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,659
purple team exercise is let the project

565
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,600
manager assign stages and times so for

566
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,980
example if it's going to take the red

567
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,440
team let's say two hours to work through

568
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,760
the checklist of activity whether

569
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,539
they're going to actually get it

570
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,400
manually or whatever then you schedule

571
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,500
them in the morning or whatever to do

572
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,780
the activity and schedule the blue team

573
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,159
in the afternoon to do the initial

574
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,480
threat hunts and then maybe the next day

575
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,159
is the collaboration session so you can

576
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,659
block it out and do it different ways

577
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,039
you don't want to wait a couple of weeks

578
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,360
because then a lot of the useful logs

579
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,980
probably will have rolled off you want

580
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,960
to do it pretty close to the window if

581
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,640
you can

582
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,620
um and it is especially important if

583
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,179
you're going to bring non-security folks

584
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,860
like like one of the things we see a lot

585
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,600
when people want to test uh their

586
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,179
capabilities to execute their incident

587
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,280
response plan frequently there will be a

588
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
network engineer representative whatever

589
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,179
they call it because one of the things

590
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,740
they'll have in there is if they are

591
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,799
failing to prevent you know the spread

592
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,539
of some kind of malware

593
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,340
what one thing you can do is just start

594
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,260
turning off network connectivity to

595
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,880
other segments to keep those from being

596
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,260
impacted while you're dealing with the

597
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,179
initial spread so it's important to make

598
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,320
sure that you are if you're going to

599
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,460
bring that person in that you have a

600
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,080
thing for them to do something you're

601
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,100
going to simulate and then a way for

602
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,140
them to you know action their whatever

603
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,880
their part of the checklist is so really

604
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,320
important that the project manager lets

605
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,700
the red team know here are the

606
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,960
participants here are the things we want

607
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,580
to make sure we cover all goes back to

608
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,380
those objectives

609
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,720
right and how important in terms of

610
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,799
targets is it to in your opinion an

611
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,860
experience to try to do as much as you

612
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,740
can with simulations for example uh on a

613
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,179
on life environment like production

614
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,919
environments uh with the right image of

615
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,700
your uh production uh servers and

616
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,679
laptops and whatnot how important is

617
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,559
that super great question Carlos that is

618
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,559
uh probably one of the most important

619
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,880
things is when you pick a Target you

620
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,620
pick a representative Target that is

621
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,000
actually in your production environment

622
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,280
it can be technically speaking a lab

623
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,679
system but it needs to be using the same

624
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,780
tools you use to do all of the other

625
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
incident response right I mean you're

626
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,659
essentially doing a CTF in production

627
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,000
when you do a purple team right now

628
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,220
there's value in learning

629
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,440
like the individual folks in this

630
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,760
exercise learning if you're doing it

631
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,520
like in a cloud range but to actually

632
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,620
make the most use of this you have to

633
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,179
use your environment with your security

634
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,539
tools on your in your constraints right

635
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,940
um and I think what we represent what we

636
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,820
normally recommend to folks is that

637
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,080
um the gold image thing is is

638
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,520
interesting to us like if you have a

639
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,380
typical like laptop that somebody in the

640
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,780
finance team gets that's a great one to

641
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,520
start with right the only reason we

642
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,380
would say get us a different machine is

643
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,179
let's say that you have a wildly

644
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,940
different EDR policy for Developers

645
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,919
versus like accountants that that would

646
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,120
be interesting and we probably want one

647
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,740
of each the other thing would be is if

648
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,020
you have like your organization is one

649
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,299
that has either acquired others or

650
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,740
whatever and you have like well this

651
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,480
group still runs this EDR the other

652
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,860
group that we acquired last year still

653
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,419
on their other EDR well that those are

654
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,580
two totally different things let's do

655
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,260
probably at some point whether we do it

656
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,880
both in the same exercises Up For Debate

657
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
but both should be tested right yeah so

658
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,340
we think of that as like if you're going

659
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,600
to have one you need to know that this

660
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,299
is probably a prize applies broadly to

661
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,919
your Fleet now eventually you do want to

662
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,500
test other systems uh but yeah to get

663
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,360
started but that's what I would say

664
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,880
yeah very important

665
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,000
and we'll talk more about that that how

666
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,760
to do that safely later yeah so but

667
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,740
there are some bad practices too then

668
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,840
walk us through some of those yeah well

669
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
I did mention this one just do it

670
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,279
because yes because it's it's cool it's

671
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,600
what everybody's talking about now is

672
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,279
definitely a bad reason to basically do

673
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,080
anything in life actually

674
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,559
um if you don't share information Then I

675
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,940
then you're not purple to me I don't

676
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,779
know what you're doing but it's not

677
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,460
purple teaming

678
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,720
um I think the importance here

679
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,740
is that when we execute activity the

680
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,799
whole point is you are correlating this

681
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,980
activity equals these logs

682
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,600
right some of them you may already have

683
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,820
alerts for great some of it you may

684
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,559
already block great but the whole point

685
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,900
is when attackers actually do the things

686
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,940
that they try to do how does our

687
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,200
environment handle it right how do the

688
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,640
tools that we're relying on handle it

689
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,960
and so if you're not sharing it then

690
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,980
like I said I don't know what you're

691
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,820
doing

692
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,260
um I do think this is important you

693
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,360
definitely like if we're gonna think any

694
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,159
team is better it's the blue team which

695
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,260
is not how this normally rolls out I

696
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,240
think the other thing that we'll see uh

697
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,679
is understanding that the purpose of

698
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,480
this exercise is for the organization to

699
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,440
get better

700
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
which is either both of these teams or

701
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,740
one team that has been hired by the

702
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,779
organization right so flat out either

703
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,059
way we're doing it

704
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,640
I think if you want to stay on target

705
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,140
like there might be other juicy things

706
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,700
you see I think you should note those

707
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,260
and either and you know put those into

708
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,840
another engagement something that is

709
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,580
kind of along the same lines of this

710
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,740
that we see sometimes is that folks want

711
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,140
to treat the miter attack Matrix as a

712
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,600
like a bingo or like a checklist and

713
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,179
that is not what that is like the mega

714
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,039
attack project is an attempt to

715
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,860
categorize things that attackers do it

716
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,080
is not a comprehensive list of

717
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,299
everything an attacker can do right and

718
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,679
even if you open up an individual

719
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,000
technique

720
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,080
there are dozens of ways to execute that

721
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,659
thing so to say that you are like good

722
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,220
on one of those

723
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,080
uh it's like there's an infinite number

724
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,279
of test cases how could you ever

725
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,140
accomplish yeah the point is that you

726
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,400
test against those and you're

727
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,440
understanding that you do collect data

728
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,700
that allows your team to hunt those

729
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,559
things down but to say that you're good

730
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,820
on one of those I mean you could say

731
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,919
you're good on a test case

732
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,539
but you're not good at a minor attack

733
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,760
technique right I mean that's that's

734
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,140
like saying I'm good on science

735
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,679
and sharing information

736
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,059
starts very early in the process not

737
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,700
just as you're doing the exercise like

738
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,700
yes once it goes together you gotta

739
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,220
Define your targets your take the piece

740
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,419
whatever what is it the goals together

741
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,600
and share with each other such that you

742
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,820
have that collaboration as you navigate

743
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,100
through the through the exercise but it

744
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,159
starts starts way before uh during that

745
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,600
planning session and even the

746
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,659
preparation and especially if you are if

747
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:07,799
you have an internal red team they

748
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,240
probably know what your security tool

749
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,500
set is but if you have an external

750
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,700
renting that you're bringing in to help

751
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,440
do this purple team and they ask you

752
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,000
like what security tools do you use

753
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,679
don't don't not want to give them that

754
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,480
information it's very valuable when we

755
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,700
come into run purple team exercises we

756
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,340
know based on the EDR you're using what

757
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,659
what test cases we're going to use that

758
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:25,919
we know will get caught and what test

759
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,659
cases we we can use that we think will

760
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,340
bypass it that is valuable information

761
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,860
for your team to know right and if you

762
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,059
don't tell us that then that's just less

763
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,980
prep operation we can do to be prepared

764
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,440
for the day of the exercise to give you

765
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,480
the maximum value so yeah sharing

766
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,820
information totally agree both ways blue

767
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,559
show that the the right see everything

768
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,419
and the red should absolutely make sure

769
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,039
blue sees everything they get all the

770
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,539
artifacts they get any scripts you're

771
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,340
going to use all of that stuff has to go

772
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,500
in they need to see all that stuff

773
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,020
yeah so now let's walk through being

774
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,940
bringing this together and walk through

775
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,760
the uh

776
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,220
uh how the process will go from a

777
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,500
practical point of view I'm running a

778
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,080
purple team exercise so it starts with

779
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,299
planning we mentioned that we mentioned

780
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:13,679
all of these but here is also uh to

781
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,539
band's last point

782
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,559
you know have your uh security stack

783
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,080
inventory right well what is it what are

784
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
the tools that you have have those

785
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,600
available

786
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,500
um

787
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,559
the project coordinator project manager

788
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,620
exercise coordinator should be leading

789
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,760
here uh assigning roles responsibilities

790
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,320
and then

791
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,260
um selecting that what tools are you

792
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,840
going to use right that's critical as

793
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,500
well Ben correct

794
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,380
for actually going at it let's perform

795
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,200
the attack quote unquote or or the

796
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,659
simulation so Douglas uh we're gonna get

797
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,039
more into that in a little bit but talk

798
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,380
us through that as well yeah you know so

799
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,760
one of the things about picking the the

800
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,080
way that the red team is going to

801
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,640
operate really like once you've figured

802
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,039
out what you want to test and the types

803
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,140
of the objective of the of the uh game

804
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,600
you know it's really important that that

805
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,039
you're bringing the right thing so for

806
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,000
example

807
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,059
we see the use of cobalt strike in a lot

808
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:16,620
of data breach reports right where

809
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,080
threat actors think Cobalt strike is so

810
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,539
great that they use it themselves if the

811
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,460
customer's concern is they want to sell

812
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,380
could we detect Cobalt strike beacons

813
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,700
running our environment and you roll in

814
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,679
and you've got like you know other great

815
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,779
C2 Frameworks that are not Cobalt strike

816
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:31,740
that's not going to be very very

817
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,539
successful the other thing I'll say is

818
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,380
that there is Super Value in the ability

819
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,899
to run this test over and over again in

820
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,299
the exact same way so that as you make

821
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,159
changes and improvements you can track

822
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,799
it identically so there's all there when

823
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,299
we talk about how we get into some of

824
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,640
these later stages there's a phase for

825
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,200
manual red teaming and there's also a

826
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,200
phase for like highly repeatable very

827
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,779
rapidly generated activity so that you

828
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,520
can sort of build a Baseline and that

829
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,020
you can rerun that Baseline frequently

830
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,640
so if you're in the middle of tuning it

831
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,200
doesn't take long to reruns like oh yep

832
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,179
got the alert now great that tuning that

833
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,520
works that's the right config or you

834
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,500
know we tuned these three months ago in

835
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,299
a purple team workshop that we did let's

836
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,980
make sure this still works right because

837
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,539
now we want to work on new stuff we

838
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,740
don't want to always keep going back to

839
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,020
the same so you can do that if you have

840
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,179
an automation platform available uh that

841
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,159
will help like really raise the floor of

842
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,779
what you can execute in a purple team

843
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,299
for sure

844
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:30,720
yeah and and then planning

845
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,559
goes almost alongside with preparation

846
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
and preparation is more of the again

847
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,080
what tools we're using what uh trade

848
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,600
intelligence what do we know about our

849
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,200
industry our environment that that we

850
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
may be at risk what are our

851
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,240
vulnerabilities our security controls

852
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,820
and the agreement on what it is that

853
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,039
we're gonna try to run and attack

854
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,020
anything else in the preparation

855
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
foreign

856
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,260
then you go and you want to again this

857
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,460
is a collaborative conversation

858
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,260
Ben mentioned some of these do we have

859
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,020
the proper Telemetry for what we want to

860
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,980
test

861
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,760
right that's critical correct

862
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,159
big time and I I really like that third

863
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,919
bullet there Carlos the discuss expected

864
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,960
results

865
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,399
there's a lot of times when you'll work

866
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,980
with somebody who's a as a like a red

867
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,020
team consultant and they are they're

868
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,299
they're like we want to test

869
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,640
our EDR implementation to make sure that

870
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,960
it picks up things like great well what

871
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,340
do you expect it to pick up and that's

872
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,080
where like all of a sudden you realize

873
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,399
I've never thought about that like I

874
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,020
just knew I had to have an EDR I didn't

875
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,299
actually think about why like what I

876
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,760
expected to do I expect it to log that

877
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,100
or alert or block that I don't I guess I

878
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,080
expect it to block that super duper

879
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,120
helpful to know that now that's that EDR

880
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
is kind of a big topic there may be

881
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,899
really specific things like if you get

882
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:01,860
into

883
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,299
cases where you're talking about data

884
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,460
exfiltration and the customer believes

885
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,779
they have spent a lot of time and money

886
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,399
on some sort of a data loss prevention

887
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,039
solution and they're like I believe that

888
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,659
if you were to pick any of these

889
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:13,980
documents that are watermarked or

890
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,419
whatever they call DLP things these days

891
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,580
that you would not be able to exfiltrate

892
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,220
them out of this network that is an

893
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,919
awesome expectation right now we have a

894
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,899
lot of ground we can figure out okay so

895
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,299
any getting these documents out of this

896
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,519
network constitutes like that's an edge

897
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,960
case they didn't have a chance to look

898
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,460
at yet and that is valuable information

899
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,279
form or they can validate that yeah that

900
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,539
totally works the way we thought it did

901
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,100
they tried all these different cloud

902
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,779
services that didn't work they tried all

903
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:40,860
these other things that didn't work they

904
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,240
couldn't send it directly via mail what

905
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,860
whatever the solutions are right and

906
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,000
that's where the red team needs to get

907
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,659
creative uh and take that tactic or that

908
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,000
technique data exfiltration via you know

909
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,340
standard services and be like okay let's

910
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,100
go get to get to work on that right

911
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,799
yeah and then you get to the day the big

912
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,679
day is here so walk us through that day

913
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
uh and I want to point out that we are

914
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,799
like halfway through this chart and we

915
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,740
are just now actually at the exercise

916
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,659
yeah exactly so there's a lot more stuff

917
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,940
we planned before yeah yeah so the

918
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,619
executing is actually the fun part I

919
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,659
mean that is like literally the CTF in

920
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,339
production that is where the red team

921
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,679
who has been working on all of the

922
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,820
things that we came up with all these

923
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,560
objectives all these things we wanted to

924
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,399
test

925
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,199
and they have built out their test cases

926
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,879
they built out their plan they've come

927
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,699
in the team who is going to provide the

928
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,260
blue team side of this is all logged

929
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,460
into the tools they're looking they're

930
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,300
ready

931
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,099
and off we go right

932
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,300
um and I think

933
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,918
what's going to happen here is going to

934
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,540
be uh some things will go exactly the

935
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,980
way we expect them to and a bunch are

936
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,719
going to go wrong

937
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,879
yeah one way or the other I think that

938
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,739
the red team didn't expect to to fail

939
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,540
will fail and I think the blue team

940
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,000
didn't expect to fail will fail right of

941
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,040
course which brings us to the next one

942
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,418
right which we keep working our way

943
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,280
through the different ttps recording the

944
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,700
outcome right right and right and then

945
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,500
you continue to monitor throughout the

946
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,260
exercise right yep yep and then the the

947
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,900
real thing is we document the things

948
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,880
that we learned where there were gaps in

949
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,260
our ability to detect or mitigate

950
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,020
something really important also uh one

951
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,119
thing that that shows up a lot in these

952
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,800
these plans is making sure that you

953
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,300
document

954
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,000
um the exact conditions under which the

955
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,460
tests were executed like on what system

956
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,800
as what user where their payloads

957
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,780
involved um all those other things that

958
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,339
you need to know so when you go back

959
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,260
like well you know you ran as a local

960
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,060
admin all these other things so we now

961
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,500
know like that's dangerous but if we go

962
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,880
back and we rerun this as a standard

963
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,339
user maybe none of that stuff works and

964
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,780
that's not to say that that admin test

965
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,660
isn't valuable it's definitely is and

966
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,220
now you have additional things you can

967
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,960
leverage when you go back later to be

968
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,579
like how can we build better alerts on

969
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,380
this you'll be like I know if we bring

970
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,300
in the data that the user account is an

971
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,880
admin that is an alert and this other

972
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,420
one isn't right super valuable data

973
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,880
yeah yeah and then of course you go and

974
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,920
remediate uh or start your remediation

975
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,079
activities and then really you start all

976
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,660
over the next hopefully in the next

977
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,260
quarter or or with some frequency and

978
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,800
and one thing there that Ben mentioned a

979
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,240
few minutes ago is

980
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,119
do a quick check on one of the of the

981
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,579
ones that you just did completed again

982
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,440
just to make sure that nothing has

983
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,200
changed so yeah yeah this is continues

984
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,720
yeah and as a follow-up like once you've

985
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,460
do that implementation the next purple

986
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,079
team can include a little section of

987
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,880
like let's make sure that implementation

988
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,740
worked you can also have a section up

989
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,119
here stuff we fixed three months ago

990
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
let's make sure that still works and now

991
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,540
let's get to the new fun stuff

992
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,780
yeah so now we've talked a lot about uh

993
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,760
purple teaming let's talk about you know

994
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
the one of the tools that can be used

995
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,660
for that which is

996
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,000
known as bass bridge and attack

997
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,940
simulation which is really

998
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,540
um

999
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,960
tools that you can use to simulate the

1000
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,940
attack vectors do it in an automated

1001
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,640
basis and so

1002
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,700
it becomes that pane of glass right

1003
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,440
during the exercise can you talk us

1004
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,400
through this

1005
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,380
sure absolutely so the first thing let's

1006
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,520
talk about there's the idea of

1007
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,560
simulating an attack and emulating an

1008
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,480
attack emulation is what you normally

1009
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,820
get in an automation platform but we've

1010
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,320
got a list of things that we frequently

1011
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,119
see attackers do we're going to run

1012
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,859
through those and that is the that is

1013
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,780
the part that I was saying like a blue

1014
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,099
team person

1015
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,260
uh who does who maybe doesn't know a lot

1016
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,660
about creating the threat actor activity

1017
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,220
like they're not a red teamer but they

1018
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,960
they work in the sock

1019
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,500
should be able to kick off a emulated uh

1020
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,300
campaign that looks like an attacker to

1021
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,040
validate that that their tools are still

1022
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,000
working

1023
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,320
so that should be a definite part of it

1024
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,420
simulation is really the manual red team

1025
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,280
side like you the red team comes in

1026
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,240
they've done their research they know

1027
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,560
what industry in and the things you're

1028
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,119
worried about the tools you have and

1029
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,480
they they bring the same level of

1030
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,920
inventiveness that a real threat actor

1031
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,619
would right to to the to the Sim

1032
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,260
situation a lot of times you'll see in

1033
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,099
the marketing they'll talk about

1034
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,720
continuous security assessments what it

1035
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,820
really means is you can run it a lot

1036
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,560
right so it's not like a pen test where

1037
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
we ran it back in April and we're still

1038
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,280
working off of remediating 700 pounds in

1039
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,380
April even though it's September we we

1040
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,300
want this to be more up-to-date and all

1041
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,980
the time because obviously things are

1042
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,020
changing and you know just because your

1043
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,060
EDR worked a week ago does not guarantee

1044
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,700
that it works today uh so anyways the

1045
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,260
ability to run this thing in an

1046
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,420
automated manner is super important

1047
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,680
um especially if you can like schedule

1048
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,520
it

1049
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,020
and if it's a baseline activity where

1050
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,220
it's going to run stuff and you know

1051
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,839
that it's going to be doing those things

1052
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,700
super helpful and again to the point of

1053
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,740
the the blue teamer who might not know

1054
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,420
how to execute a process injection

1055
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,920
attack but they sure know how to build

1056
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,140
alerts looking for it that is super

1057
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,400
duper helpful now they don't have to

1058
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,020
know how to do it they just know how to

1059
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,380
go in and run the automated campaign

1060
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,240
I think it is important

1061
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,800
um if you're going to use some type of

1062
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,660
automation one of the values of that is

1063
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,160
when you expand your scope of what

1064
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,839
you're sampling that goes from being

1065
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,099
something and now like a rate you know a

1066
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,060
red team or doesn't need to take another

1067
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,380
two hours to figure out how to connect

1068
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,480
to this machine in the Pittsburgh office

1069
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,640
right they can just you can use the any

1070
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,380
type of automation you've got to do the

1071
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,720
attack emulation run on that and now you

1072
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,060
can see like do we get the same outcome

1073
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,579
there that we do like in the main Center

1074
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,720
where we've been running a lot of this

1075
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,040
testing

1076
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,320
um if it's automated the chances are

1077
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,520
that you'll get through it a lot faster

1078
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,800
so as an example if we were to manually

1079
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,320
run through the activity we do in a

1080
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,400
campaign would probably take anywhere

1081
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,780
from 30 minutes to two hours and we

1082
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,040
could typically do it in about 20

1083
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,380
minutes with our automation right and so

1084
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,780
that gives you all that extra time now

1085
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,119
that you've gained back is collaboration

1086
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,119
time how do we make the defenses better

1087
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,980
um and I want to be very clear here when

1088
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,079
we talk about ttps we just mean threat

1089
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,060
actor activity and so hopefully by being

1090
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,400
able to test a larger set of that you

1091
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,780
are really testing like lots of

1092
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,400
different ways of Express expressing

1093
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,940
those ttps so like an example I use I

1094
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,099
use a lot and um

1095
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:02,040
there are several different ways to

1096
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,140
create a local account right a local

1097
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,940
user account right you can use a regular

1098
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,800
command line you can do a Powershell

1099
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,720
command there's other things like apis

1100
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,940
calls you can do super important if you

1101
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,320
can script all those up and have them in

1102
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,760
your automation platform now you can

1103
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,740
test all those different ways so if you

1104
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,880
have an organization that is just

1105
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,400
monitoring for the like net user ad

1106
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,420
stuff

1107
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,800
like that'll text that but it won't

1108
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,119
detect any of the others right and so

1109
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,560
it's really valuable to do that so

1110
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,599
that's a super important differentiator

1111
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,859
there

1112
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,500
um I think the you know the the ability

1113
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,660
to validate that your controls work the

1114
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,760
way you think they do is really one of

1115
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,339
the main features of having any kind of

1116
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,260
automation right that you're going to

1117
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,440
put together a suite of actions that you

1118
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,240
expect every one of these to be blocked

1119
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,440
or every one of these to generate an

1120
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,480
alert and that way you go sit down you

1121
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,560
run it

1122
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,540
it does its thing and you go look in

1123
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,280
your spunk console wherever you got

1124
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,839
there and you get like alert alert alert

1125
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,280
alert you just kind of work through the

1126
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,480
checklist and like yep everything's

1127
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,560
working today

1128
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,300
way better finding it out that way that

1129
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,400
something's not working than having a

1130
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,839
real breach and be like how come the

1131
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,280
thing didn't work that stops the bad

1132
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,720
stuff and you realize it hasn't worked

1133
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,800
for three weeks

1134
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,140
yeah I agree and that's that's again

1135
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,720
from a management point of view that's

1136
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,740
that's the duel there if I can uh

1137
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,220
instill confidence in management that we

1138
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,900
are investing in the right things and

1139
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,140
working you know effectively then I'll

1140
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,380
make a lot of friends as a season Carlos

1141
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,820
you help a lot of organizations that

1142
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,260
have had some kind of security incident

1143
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,220
in the past

1144
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,380
my guess is that if you had to like put

1145
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,900
a number on it it is about 75 or maybe

1146
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,740
more

1147
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,720
of those organizations that had like a

1148
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,700
technical security event thought they

1149
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,160
had a thing that would detect an alert

1150
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,440
or block the thing that happened

1151
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,000
and they were super surprised when it

1152
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,560
didn't right would you say that number

1153
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,640
is about right

1154
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,200
yeah I would say so it is incredibly uh

1155
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,040
is inside we see it all the time and and

1156
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,619
we will talk about some of the use cases

1157
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,980
soon but even when you do a like a

1158
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,980
tabletop exercise and start seeing

1159
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,900
yeah like you know the combination of

1160
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,640
the tabletop with a tool like this and

1161
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,079
start seeing what could really happen

1162
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,480
then it doesn't eye opening for many

1163
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,820
yeah absolutely

1164
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,020
so here are some use cases right uh so

1165
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,780
using of course these tools for your

1166
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,180
exercise we've talked extensively about

1167
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,599
that uh we talk about making sure that

1168
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,619
you're running in production

1169
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,140
environments because of what Ben just

1170
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,300
mentioned because it's the rate of

1171
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,880
failure is high and that's why also you

1172
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,420
you have a you know defensive depth or

1173
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,420
call it whatever you want to call it uh

1174
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,220
but that's why you have different layers

1175
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,420
of controls and then you know you you

1176
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,780
have that real time uh conversation

1177
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,420
right man I think that's one of the most

1178
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,260
important things here yep

1179
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,099
the real time

1180
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:07,500
like the delay between I just ran this

1181
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,420
attack thing

1182
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,220
and then the alert doesn't show up for

1183
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,480
20 minutes right I think a lot of people

1184
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,920
without doing this type of testing

1185
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,200
assume that that is instantaneous

1186
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,060
right but there's like there's delivery

1187
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,339
of the log events to wherever the alerts

1188
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,260
get generated and then a lot of the

1189
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,520
places where the alerts get generated

1190
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,500
there's not real time they like batch

1191
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,000
them up and like every 10 minutes this

1192
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,980
search runs and if something shows up in

1193
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,780
the search there it goes but it's

1194
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,920
important to know how much lead time

1195
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,480
does an attacker have once that alert

1196
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,400
pops so you know like oh man they've

1197
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,079
already been doing this for 15 minutes I

1198
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,119
got to get after it

1199
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,220
um yeah yeah and or even you know when

1200
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,579
we get alert uh fatigue we do get the

1201
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,980
Lord but we don't take action on it

1202
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,599
because oh my God it's another one

1203
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,079
constantly so now you can see that the

1204
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,140
which ones are the ones that you need to

1205
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,299
pay closer attention to right yeah

1206
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,720
go ahead oh yeah go ahead Carlos yeah

1207
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,220
this is an important one

1208
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,500
no well I just mentioned that when you

1209
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,319
when you do that uh with the tabletop

1210
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,780
exercises and depending on the level of

1211
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,400
the table top but you couldn't even have

1212
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,260
some Senior Management around and see

1213
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,599
what happens and that's a big one

1214
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,000
I think it's really valuable to use some

1215
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,740
automation to do this in the middle of a

1216
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,839
tabletop exercise because most of the

1217
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,060
time in my experience especially if you

1218
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,160
have like a senior uh executive

1219
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,500
management team who's there they if they

1220
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,599
have ever observed any kind of like I.T

1221
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,520
outage it's almost always been like an

1222
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,500
accidental like they pushed a new patch

1223
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,119
and it brought things down very rarely

1224
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,560
do they get to observe the way that like

1225
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,940
threat hunting works and it is a little

1226
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,079
bit different

1227
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,460
um and when you go to those if you don't

1228
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,900
have like something for the threat team

1229
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,240
representative who's there to actually

1230
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,460
go do they just make Grand statements

1231
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,380
like oh yeah we would identify all of

1232
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,880
the command and control channels and use

1233
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,220
isolate all those computers and stop the

1234
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,240
spread of you know whatever the

1235
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,680
ransomware is and you're looking on your

1236
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,300
on your script you're like well I know

1237
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,380
that's not the case because the next

1238
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,000
step is it's about to get worse so you

1239
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,680
would you have not done that so rather

1240
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,300
than be the jerk and be like okay I get

1241
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,380
that that's what you think you would do

1242
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,819
but it doesn't really work that way be

1243
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,500
like fantastic there are currently three

1244
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,700
or more

1245
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,980
executing action activities here are the

1246
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,319
iocs for it but see if you don't see you

1247
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,240
find it right it's and I find that they

1248
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,220
actually enjoy that too and even though

1249
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,660
they want to look good in front of their

1250
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,819
bosses and their bosses bosses uh by

1251
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,560
maybe like struggling and showing the

1252
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,359
lack of ability for them to like very

1253
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,280
quickly get to the answer it kind of

1254
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,079
reinforces probably a message they've

1255
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:32,339
been sending before anyways about

1256
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:35,160
needing better teams or something

1257
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,260
um I do want to go back to the first

1258
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,579
item there the running purple team

1259
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,220
exercise is using baz I will say this uh

1260
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,920
they can be a like accelerator but I

1261
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,540
don't think that you can get the

1262
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,640
advantage of a red team exclusively

1263
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,140
using a breach and attack simulation

1264
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,060
tool I think it allows you to again

1265
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,680
Elevate the floor you're going to run a

1266
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,300
lot of activity that you've either the

1267
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,740
red team has already gone through and

1268
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,599
validated is important and that you've

1269
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,940
tuned to uh but I don't think if you're

1270
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,680
planning on just using like buying an

1271
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,060
expensive basketball and that being your

1272
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,740
red team you're probably not planning on

1273
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,660
having a very good red team component in

1274
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,700
your purple team exercise so what we

1275
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,380
like to focus on is the ability of like

1276
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,359
automation so we can get through a lot

1277
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,040
of like the stuff we know we want to get

1278
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,900
through and then being able to augment

1279
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,760
with some manual activity and some new

1280
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,280
activity uh that we kind of like keep

1281
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,579
you know keep moving uh a little more to

1282
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,859
like expanding the capabilities of what

1283
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,839
the team is is able to detect and block

1284
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,700
but I do think it really raises the

1285
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,839
floor of what you can get out of a

1286
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,880
purple team exercise by having some kind

1287
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,740
of Automation in there

1288
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,260
yeah and on to close these on the other

1289
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,540
side of that tabletop exercise

1290
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,040
when I run them without a tool like this

1291
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,240
then I 80 of the time 70 of the time at

1292
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,180
least I get that it or security team

1293
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,560
telling me that's not going to happen

1294
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,319
here because we have cross strike or

1295
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,540
Sentinel one or whatever whatever we

1296
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,400
have and so it's not going to happen I'm

1297
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,180
like well yeah so do they they have it

1298
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,480
so it gives you that other piece right

1299
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,020
but um so we want to play real quick we

1300
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,579
had a few minutes left

1301
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,040
um a quick video on

1302
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,220
one example right a use case uh in this

1303
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,859
case uh Ben is going to run us through a

1304
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,839
process injection

1305
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,740
um example so I'm hoping that it uh does

1306
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,160
play I'll give a few seconds of quiet

1307
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,078
time just in case we need to edit

1308
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
um

1309
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,420
hey everybody today we're going to talk

1310
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,880
about kicking off a simulation in the

1311
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,619
blind spot platform what we call a

1312
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:02,520
campaign

1313
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,980
and today we're going to do it using a

1314
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,720
process injection technique something

1315
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,240
that you've probably heard about and one

1316
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,220
of our goals is to make it very easy for

1317
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,859
you to replicate that well no matter

1318
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:15,540
what simulation type you want to run

1319
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,060
inside a blind spot kicking that off

1320
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,079
via a process injection method so we're

1321
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,700
going to scroll down here we've picked

1322
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,440
the maze ransomware simulation that we

1323
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,960
want to run and we'll find our 64-bit

1324
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,859
for Windows process injection

1325
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:35,520
simulation execution type

1326
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,160
now a couple of things in previous years

1327
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,900
we talked about some of the different

1328
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,359
execution methods involving us putting

1329
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,280
part of the payload on disk before we

1330
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,140
can run it one of the main differences

1331
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,300
with this one is that this payload this

1332
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,520
Shell Code payload that we have here is

1333
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,200
never going to touch disk it's only

1334
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,300
going to live in memory when we kick

1335
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,740
this campaign off it's going to happen

1336
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,260
the blind spot agent will download this

1337
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,720
Shell Code that we have here that

1338
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,700
represents the beginning stages of this

1339
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,460
simulation we'll inject it into the

1340
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,200
process Target that we're about to

1341
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,420
select for it and all of that will run

1342
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,240
in memory we do publish the hash values

1343
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,220
of the Shell Code but it's hard to say

1344
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,900
that you'll actually see these in memory

1345
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,440
but the C2 domain is the correct domain

1346
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,200
and is the indicator that your team can

1347
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,640
use to find out

1348
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,220
what is going on or at this simulation

1349
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,619
where the simulation May exists so if

1350
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:29,700
you've seen some of our previous

1351
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,440
campaign videos you'd know that there

1352
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,940
weren't a lot of questions to answer we

1353
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,760
have a couple more on this one so let's

1354
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,300
go ahead and get this one started so

1355
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,740
we're going to name this something in

1356
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,079
this case I'm going to name it May's Pi

1357
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,420
demo for process injection again the

1358
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,160
payload and execution options already

1359
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,599
selected for us so we don't have to do

1360
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,700
anything there we do have to make a

1361
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,200
couple decisions though about what

1362
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,819
method we want to use for process

1363
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,020
injection

1364
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,300
hey what Target we want to go for

1365
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,520
the agent currently has five different

1366
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,079
methods using the windows apis of

1367
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:07,200
creating the process injection execution

1368
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,440
method essentially requesting access to

1369
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,020
another processes memory space putting

1370
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,400
our Shell Code in there and then running

1371
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,800
it all of these work and I would

1372
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,420
encourage you to go through them and

1373
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,520
take equal turns running using different

1374
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,920
methods just to see if your tools on

1375
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,619
your endpoints react differently one of

1376
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,180
the things that we have the ability to

1377
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,420
do inside of the commit the tool here is

1378
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,060
to specify the Target that we are going

1379
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,339
to inject our Shell Code into now

1380
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:37,380
because when we built the blind spot

1381
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,900
tool we had no idea what systems we may

1382
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,339
end up running some of our simulations

1383
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,859
on we always want to keep an eye towards

1384
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:46,920
safe and reliable execution of our

1385
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,559
simulations without impacting the

1386
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,180
production workloads that that system

1387
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,400
may be running so whether this is a

1388
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,680
laptop of one of your colleagues or a

1389
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,240
domain controller somewhere in your

1390
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,400
environment we don't want to cause a

1391
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,260
problem with a process that is in turn

1392
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,180
used by something that other people are

1393
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,440
relying on

1394
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,420
so we're actually going to start a new

1395
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,000
instance of the security health assist

1396
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,940
tray app and then we will inject our

1397
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,420
payload Shell Code into that now the

1398
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,119
security health Assist tray.exe app if

1399
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,160
you're not familiar with it is the

1400
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,260
little app that Microsoft makes that

1401
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,940
goes into your system tray and tells you

1402
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,720
if your Windows Defender is turned on or

1403
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,359
not which we see that ours definitely is

1404
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,400
so we've got everything in here that we

1405
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,260
need now we gave it a name we picked

1406
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,540
that process injection method we picked

1407
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,099
that process ejection Target we are

1408
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,599
going to submit this

1409
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,980
and now this

1410
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,619
Pro this campaign is going to sit and

1411
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,960
wait for our blind spot agent to check

1412
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,059
in with it and be ready to run it so

1413
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,160
we'll give that just a second while that

1414
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,720
is queuing up we're going to pull up our

1415
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,960
task manager so that we can see as new

1416
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,059
uh processes are created so we're going

1417
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,520
to scroll down here into the S's and

1418
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,200
we're going to look and we see the

1419
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,440
security health

1420
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,839
systrade.exe right here this 8760 that's

1421
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,520
the one that's actually running that

1422
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,500
should be on our machine we're going to

1423
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,359
let this run for just a second and we

1424
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:13,920
will wait and see

1425
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,440
when the new security health assist

1426
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,900
trade out XC app pops up we'll notice

1427
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,700
some big differences about it well we're

1428
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,140
waiting you notice this one which is the

1429
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,819
real one the one that's the windows

1430
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,819
started when it started up this has 1.88

1431
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:29,460
megabytes in use in the memory space

1432
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,040
which is pretty good it uses basically

1433
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,540
no CPU you're not going to see that

1434
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,000
really uh spiky numbers here in the

1435
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,800
process hacker we're going to give this

1436
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,660
just a minute and we'll notice oh look

1437
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,920
there it is another one has already

1438
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,900
popped up the security health assist Ray

1439
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,619
app it says 11 584 is the thread you'll

1440
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,240
notice this is already bigger than the

1441
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,220
other one let's take a look at our

1442
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,319
points about Asia can we see sure enough

1443
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,319
stimulation injected using the creative

1444
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,460
method running a process ID

1445
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,200
11584 so there it is

1446
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,380
I think Windows Defender turned on we've

1447
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,880
got our app here and it's already

1448
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,800
continuing to grow in size if we go back

1449
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,500
to our blind spot interface and refresh

1450
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,940
the page we'll see that this is running

1451
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,339
and we can open up our campaign status

1452
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,380
model and we can see as things are

1453
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,960
beginning to run on the campaign

1454
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,880
that's it for this video come back for

1455
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,440
the next one we'll talk about how to

1456
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,420
score one of these campaigns once it's

1457
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,440
done thanks

1458
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,940
all right so

1459
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,740
can you hear me again

1460
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,720
yep we can hear you

1461
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,079
okay so let me go back so we had another

1462
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,200
video but I think we've uh God now

1463
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,440
we're running our time so the next video

1464
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,480
will be a score in that campaign how you

1465
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,900
will manipulate your result your results

1466
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,200
so go and take a look at it uh we'll

1467
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,380
post the the

1468
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,079
a link to that in Discord

1469
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,359
so you can grab it but it's also

1470
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:02,460
available in the presentation and and

1471
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,940
then our last uh item here is some

1472
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,059
resources that we're adding to the uh

1473
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,300
for you to to have and continue to learn

1474
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,220
