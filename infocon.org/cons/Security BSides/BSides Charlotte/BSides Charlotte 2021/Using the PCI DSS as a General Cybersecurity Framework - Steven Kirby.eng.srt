1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,800
good morning or good afternoon or good

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,279
evening depending on where you are in

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,640
the world

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,720
my name is steve kirby and i'm going to

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,599
be talking today about using the pci

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,240
dss as a general cyber security

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,599
framework

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,119
uh it's something that we've been doing

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,039
in my current employer for a few months

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,920
now

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
and i thought it was an interesting way

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,359
to approach

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,279
uh the issue of

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,080
security frameworks

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,359
give you a little bit of information

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,119
about me i have

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,760
over 30 years of experience in it i

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,719
started

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,920
in the late 1980s uh worked through

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
novell netware

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
more flavors of unix and i can shake the

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,800
sticky at i've done windows

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,760
i've gravitated to security issues very

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,079
early on because

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
there was a need for it

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,160
back in the day

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
security was almost an afterthought in a

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,399
lot of cases and

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
i was running some projects was

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
associated with some projects that

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
had considerable visibility would have

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,159
been a bad thing if

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,119
we had any kind of security issues

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,439
i do hold multiple security

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,320
certifications so you you know i'm an a

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
you know i'm an expert

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
uh if you believe in those things

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,920
i'm currently working as a systems

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
engineer for rns solutions we are a

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,759
third-party logistics company servicing

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,079
the pharmaceutical industry

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,479
located in jackson tennessee

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,799
it's a small company we only have about

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
a hundred employees

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
and one of the things that we discovered

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,360
when we started to try to develop

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,000
a security program

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
is that a lot of the a lot of the

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
frameworks and other documentation are

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
really geared towards

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
at least medium size and probably larger

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
organizations so

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
we're either going to have to do a lot

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
of rolling of our own

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,799
or

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,320
find and i'll find some sort of

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,200
alternative and i stumbled across

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,639
using pci dss for this purpose when i

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,560
was studying for uh the cissp

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
kevin henry who

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
teaches the course that i was taking on

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,360
that mentioned in the course of that

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,879
of the class at one of the class

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,040
sessions that someone i think in canada

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,959
had done exactly this they did they

66
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,000
simply

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,599
uh adapted pci dss as a general purpose

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,440
framework and so i decided to

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
investigate it and see what we could do

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
with it

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
we're going to talk about

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
uh four basic uh

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
concepts here the first thing i want to

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
do for just in case anybody is

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
unaware of what a security framework is

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
i want to talk about that for a little

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,000
bit

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
we want to talk about what some of the

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
most popular frameworks are and why why

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
in the world we need yet another one

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
i'll talk a little bit about how we've

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,080
chosen to adapt pci dss at rns solutions

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
and see if i can prevent some key

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
takeaways that might be useful

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,760
for people who might want to reproduce

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
this down the road

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
security frameworks are

88
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
well the security framework is a high

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
level strategy for protecting

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
information assets

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
it's usually a collection of guidelines

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
and best practices

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,400
frameworks provide guidance on what to

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
do but they don't necessarily provide

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,959
detailed instructions on how to do it it

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,080
may say

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
you need to encrypt data at rest but

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
it's not going to tell you

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,400
what ciphers to use or how what the key

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
link needs to be or any of those other

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120
factors that you would need to decide

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
for yourself

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
there are a number of popular general

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
security frameworks

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,159
i'm going to mention three but there are

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,640
plenty of others uh iso 27001

107
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
uh is very popular

108
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,239
in a lot of places not so much in the us

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,720
in the us we're very fond of the cyber

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,680
security framework or csf

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
and then the cis critical security

112
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,439
controls uh formerly known as the

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
uh sans top 20 controls

114
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,560
iso

115
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,440
27001

116
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,320
is part of a suite of

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
standards produced by the international

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,560
standards organization

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
uh

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
it's a very thorough

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
program

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
but it has some disadvantages

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,800
particularly for small shops who don't

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
necessarily have a

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
huge security budget uh for starters

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
if you want to find out anything about

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
how the program is structured

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
the official standards documents have to

129
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,759
be purchased and they are not cheap

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
i think most of the

131
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
standard asset starts at about or some

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,199
of the document sets start at about 350

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,560
dollars

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
uh and you're going to need several of

135
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,000
them and we just didn't have the budget

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,680
for that

137
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,080
uh iso

138
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,080
27001 is a very structured formal

139
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
process

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
uh it seems that you have an information

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
security management system or isms

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
already in place

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
so starting from scratch really requires

144
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,880
considerable overhead

145
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
uh the main benefit comes if you can

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,880
become certified be an approved

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
third-party examiner and that's very

148
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,479
very expensive

149
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
um

150
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,560
the there are other standards in that in

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
a series that go with the twenty seven

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
thousand series that go along with this

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
twenty seven thousand one is basically

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,400
is the building block

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
it tells you what you need to do and

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
other standards will tell you

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
for example

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,560
give you some guidance on how to do it

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,759
uh or how to assess risk and that sort

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,039
of thing

161
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,560
the iso series are quite popular

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,479
overseas uh they're not as popular in

163
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,880
the us as elsewhere as i mentioned there

164
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,440
on the slide uh you can also see soccer

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,919
or formula one motor racing

166
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,759
uh this started as a british set of

167
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,560
standards and has been adopted by

168
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,800
international organizations and you will

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
find some organizations in the us that

170
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,160
the following

171
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
but it doesn't quite have the uh

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,759
following here in the united states what

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,039
you have elsewhere

174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
probably more commonly used here in the

175
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
united states and again especially for

176
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
larger organizations

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
is the cybersecurity security framework

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
this is the national institute for

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
standards and technology

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
uh it's a division of the united states

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
government

182
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
and it produces

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
standards and guidance

184
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
uh in some cases they are obligatory for

185
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
united states government agencies or us

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
government contractors but they also

187
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
produce documents that can be

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,280
an industry

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,680
uh in this case sp

190
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,919
uh special publication

191
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,479
800-171

192
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,759
r2

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,360
is the short form designed for

194
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
non-governmental agencies this short

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
form is still 113 pages with multiple

196
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
links to external documents so it's

197
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,440
quite an ambitious undertaking

198
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,680
it was most most recently revised in

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,639
february of this year so it is a living

200
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
document

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
uh nist doesn't wait or prior to

202
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
prioritize individual controls and

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
allows a lot of room for interpretation

204
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,120
so if you don't have a large security

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,039
staff and our security staff basically

206
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,280
consists of part of me and

207
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
maybe a hand from one or two other

208
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,919
admins as needed and as possible

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,160
but we don't have a a large security

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,120
staff

211
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,759
and taking on something as ambitious as

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
this was just more than we felt like we

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
were up to

214
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
the third uh

215
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,720
framework that i mentioned will be the

216
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
cis top controls

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,639
uh formerly the sans top 20 and it's now

218
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,759
the cis top 18 controls

219
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
uh as of may of this year version 8 was

220
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
released and they were they reduced the

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,599
number of controls

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,919
from 20 to 18.

223
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,199
it does help

224
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,919
prioritize individual controls because

225
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
there are three implementation groups

226
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,479
where

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
implementation group one is really aimed

228
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
at small organizations like us

229
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,159
it's easy to overlook at the cis top

230
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,200
controls as a security framework because

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,679
18 to 120 controls doesn't sound like

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,560
much

233
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
it's actually

234
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
more detailed than it sounds

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,080
and

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,279
we might have considered this

237
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
uh for our framework but

238
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,480
there aren't a lot of supporting tools

239
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
associated with with the cis controls

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
you can get you can get the documents

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
that's no problem and find out what what

242
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
the requirements are

243
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
we're going to look at some tools that

244
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
are available for pci

245
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
that uh we just couldn't find

246
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
counterparts for for cis and we decided

247
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
we'd rather go that route than trying to

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,080
develop our own

249
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
and to quote walt disney the way to get

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
started is to quit talking and begin

251
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
doing

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
and their main reason that we

253
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
decided to

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
go with pci and use the sort of

255
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
a net adaptation

256
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
as a general purpose control or

257
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240
framework

258
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
is that we wanted to get hit hit the

259
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
ground running we are

260
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
in the middle of a major business

261
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
expansion we're going to be

262
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
uh

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
rebranding ourselves

264
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,279
in the near future probably in the next

265
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,440
10 to 12 months

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
and we wanted we wanted to wrap up our

267
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
first kind a security program before

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
that happens so we really needed to get

269
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
get more done

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
in as little time as we possibly could

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
pci dss or the payment card industry

272
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,240
data security standard

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
is a very widely used

274
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
uh

275
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
framework but it's typically only used

276
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,760
by companies that have to process

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
payment cards credits credit cards and

278
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
debit cards

279
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
it's not intended for use as a general

280
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
purpose security framework we found that

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
can be adapted for that use very easily

282
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,120
in a nutshell you just you find a global

283
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
finder in place

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,959
find cardholder data and replace with

285
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,560
sensitive data

286
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
and

287
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
all of a sudden you have a general

288
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
purpose control that works very well

289
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,320
we've been pleased with it

290
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
one of the most helpful things about uh

291
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
the pci framework

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
is they produce a spreadsheet called the

293
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,120
prioritized approach tool

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
and that is very very useful because it

295
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
offers as mentions priorities

296
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,200
helping you decide which controls need

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,959
to be implemented first

298
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,440
it also makes it very easy to track and

299
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
document how you've implemented the

300
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,440
framework

301
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,640
and that's a major advantage of pci dss

302
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
over other frameworks in particular the

303
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,880
cis top controls

304
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
the controls that pci offers are focused

305
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,920
and detailed they provide structure but

306
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
not constraints

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,279
the controls are adaptable for

308
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
organizations with small i.t staffs i've

309
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560
been able to fill in a lot of this

310
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
in maybe half

311
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
a work time

312
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,959
and i've been very pleased with the

313
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,800
results and it makes sense that

314
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
something like pci would be

315
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
amenable to smaller organizations

316
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
because even

317
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
small mom and pop stores that

318
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,920
like a gas station for example that

319
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
processes credit cards is going to have

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,959
to comply

321
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,040
with this they're going to have to fill

322
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
out the forms themselves or or

323
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
hire someone else to do it for them

324
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
we found that pci dss is easy to explain

325
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
to non-technical personnel

326
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,639
when we explain to senior management

327
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
that our goal is to treat

328
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
our sensitive corporate data with the

329
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,560
same level of security that we would

330
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
have to treat

331
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,000
payment cards or credit cards the white

332
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
clicks and it's been made for a very

333
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
easy sales job

334
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
i expect the concepts could easily be

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
communicated to other organizations as

336
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
well because

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,600
again a lot of companies have experience

338
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,079
dealing with pci dss

339
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,880
but by the same token they're using a

340
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,120
similar language uh

341
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
you don't necessarily map

342
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
uh the pci dss framework to

343
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,839
uh

344
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,320
other frameworks but you can use the

345
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
same language and communicate the same

346
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
concepts so that people who are working

347
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,639
at another company you have an interest

348
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
in what you're doing security-wise can

349
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,200
understand what you're telling them

350
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,120
and the biggest one of the other big

351
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
advantages

352
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,519
is that is extensive documentation from

353
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,800
pci dss at no charge basically their

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
full document set is available for

355
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
download the link is there at the top of

356
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
the slide

357
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
uh

358
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
if you want the forms if you want the

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,079
spreadsheets if you want the

360
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,360
instructions

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
it's no trouble getting it

362
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,279
uh

363
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,880
you'll have to register with with the

364
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,760
website and then download your arts

365
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,760
content

366
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,839
this is an example of the

367
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
prioritized approach spreadsheet and as

368
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,680
you see there this is

369
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,839
the spreadsheet as it comes from

370
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,079
pcidss you have the milestone we have

371
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
over on the left hand side

372
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,920
a list of the

373
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
objectives that you need to accomplish

374
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
and then the milestone column

375
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
prioritizes then there are three levels

376
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,000
of priority reflected on this page the

377
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,760
uh 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 are top priority and

378
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,519
basically that means they want you to

379
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
create a map of your network

380
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
asset management in in other terms the

381
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,519
you do that first you do the ones in

382
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,079
yellow label two second

383
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
and move on through the through the

384
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,720
spreadsheet you'll find three four and

385
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
the purple ones and six are the ones you

386
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,680
can do

387
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
uh towards the end of the process

388
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
because they're probably the least

389
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
pressing

390
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
the pci standard

391
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
adopts a three-pronged

392
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
approach assess

393
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
repair and report

394
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
so the first step

395
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,639
the audio this ongoing process will

396
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,600
involve

397
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
assessing

398
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
all locations where sets sensitive data

399
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
might be stored doing an inventory of

400
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
assets and business processes and

401
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,519
analyzing them for vulnerabilities that

402
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
can expose sensitive data

403
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
once you've performed the assessment you

404
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,120
perform a repair you fix identified

405
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,959
vulnerabilities and implement secure

406
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
business processes and if something hap

407
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
changes along the way you may have to

408
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
modify those processes

409
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
and once the once the processes and

410
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
vulnerabilities have been repaired you

411
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,480
report

412
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
you document what you've done you've

413
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
documented that you've assessed it and

414
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,160
that you've taken remediation

415
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,720
there's some things to keep in mind

416
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
about pci dss and one of the most

417
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
important is to remember that unless

418
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,600
you're processing payment card data

419
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,279
there's no need to stick to the letter

420
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
of of the framework

421
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,199
you can adapt this

422
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
to your to your needs and to your

423
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,399
purposes

424
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
uh

425
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,279
you for example don't have to use a

426
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,959
third party for extended external

427
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,880
vulnerability scans

428
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
uh you can do or penetration tests or

429
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,440
audits you can do all those yourself

430
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,519
we do perform external scans we've

431
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,800
contracted with a uh another company

432
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
that does that but we don't we're not

433
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,600
going out and uh

434
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
purchasing services from an approved uh

435
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
scanning vendor for example that you

436
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
wouldn't like you would have to do

437
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
if you were uh trying to maintain

438
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,560
compliance in order to process payment

439
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
cards

440
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
informal self-assessment can take the

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,959
place of an of a formal audit

442
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,240
in fact pci dss offers guidance for

443
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
performing such an assessment

444
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,399
uh pci dss requires payment card data to

445
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,120
be deleted immediately for so if there's

446
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,360
no longer a business need for it that's

447
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
not a hard and fast requirement for

448
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,359
other forms of sensitive data it's

449
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,919
probably a good idea but you're not

450
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,000
necessarily going to get into trouble if

451
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,319
you get caught not doing it as quickly

452
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,199
as someone else thinks you should

453
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,720
there's no deadline to achieve

454
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,959
compliance but you you set that for

455
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,240
yourself

456
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
uh this is a journey it's not

457
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
necessarily

458
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,400
it's it's not necessarily a sprint yeah

459
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
and it has it's going to be more of a

460
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
marathon for most people

461
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
there's no penalty pro falling out of

462
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,799
compliance because your assessment as

463
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
you as you run through the cycle

464
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
is geared towards detecting things that

465
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
might have fallen through the cracks or

466
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
a process that might no longer match

467
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,720
your current needs or practices

468
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
some needs some sections of pci dss may

469
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
not apply to you for example if you

470
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
don't develop applications in-house

471
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
there are there are sections

472
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
of the standard that talk about i'll

473
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
talk about security security uh bespoke

474
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,520
applications and those want to fly you

475
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,440
don't have to worry about them

476
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
and some sections are aimed at service

477
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,360
providers those would be outside

478
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
entities that could impact the security

479
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,080
of cardholder data again you probably

480
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,600
don't have to worry about that

481
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,160
some other things to note would be that

482
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
provisions are not as restricted

483
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,799
information that's stored electronically

484
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,360
pci has to deal with the possibility

485
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
that somebody is running one of those

486
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
old slide card processors

487
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
and that they'll need to deal with paper

488
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,440
records

489
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
uh with retention and destruction and

490
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
security of for all those

491
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
uh

492
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,320
pci envisions the secure

493
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
environment to be a subset in other

494
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
words the

495
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
uh section of your network that

496
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,760
processes payment cards is assumed to be

497
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,320
a subset of your network or a segment of

498
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
it that might not be the case if you're

499
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
using this as a general standard

500
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
because you may have

501
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,280
more than one group

502
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
of people or part group or one or more

503
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
teams processing information that

504
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,559
defines easy segmentation

505
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
if you can great but you may have to

506
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,440
think about segmenting off other things

507
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,919
that might pose a threat uh the most

508
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,919
common example would be guest wireless

509
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,679
you definitely don't

510
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,840
want people having guest access well yes

511
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,240
wireless access to anything that stores

512
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,720
sensitive data

513
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,799
some typical pitfalls for organizations

514
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
attempting to comply with pci dss would

515
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
be failing to change default passwords

516
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
on network devices be sure to do that

517
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
that's one of the first items on on the

518
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
list i think it's on the second page of

519
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
the spreadsheet

520
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
but it's something that often gets

521
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
overlooked and obviously can come back

522
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,160
invite

523
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,080
in a very hard way

524
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
poorly written web apps that allow sql

525
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
injection or otherwise expose a database

526
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
to the public internet

527
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
that's also something that's easy to

528
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,280
overlook and has something that's known

529
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,600
to cause problems in the past

530
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
and then exposing sensitive data to

531
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
insecure networks or endpoints as i

532
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,159
mentioned the guest wireless networks

533
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
and again employee mobile devices if

534
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
you're processing

535
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
sensitive data particularly financial or

536
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
personal data

537
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,320
you don't want mobile employee owned

538
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
mobile devices having access to that

539
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,039
information

540
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
sack it to me is a sick pun

541
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,080
perhaps you may have to be of my age and

542
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,880
generation to remember the laughing show

543
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
where the the punchline was always

544
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,159
socket to me

545
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
but organizations that process payment

546
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,159
card data are required to submit

547
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,880
responses to an annual self-assessment

548
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,520
questionnaire or saq

549
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
and the good news is that the saq is a

550
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
standardized form that can be downloaded

551
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
from the pci dss document library we're

552
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
working ourselves through the

553
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,840
questionnaire for class d

554
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,679
merchants uh it's taking some

555
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,679
development work because that form is a

556
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,159
pdf and so we discover that we're going

557
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
to have to make some changes to it to

558
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,720
make it more usable as a general-purpose

559
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,559
tool but it's a very handy uh

560
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,200
way of assessing where where we how far

561
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
we've come in this time that we've been

562
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
working

563
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
with modifications the saq can provide a

564
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,720
template for an review of your

565
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
organization's security practice and in

566
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,440
fact the interesting thing is the final

567
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,240
section of the saq document is known as

568
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,760
an estimation of compliance

569
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,480
the attestation of compliance doesn't

570
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,200
soon require full compliance rather it

571
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,280
provides an action plan for

572
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,799
non-compliant requirements and a

573
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
timetable for completing those

574
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
requirements so if there are things that

575
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
need to be done

576
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,840
that you can carry that over into your

577
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,879
next next year's plan

578
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
takeaways well you're going to have to

579
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,320
look at some very familiar looking areas

580
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
uh when dealing with pci dss you'll need

581
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
to look at network protection firewalls

582
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
and network segmentation

583
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
passwords and settings making sure that

584
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
passwords is secure and defaults have

585
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,679
all been changed

586
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,080
uh you'll need to make sure data is

587
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
encrypted when it's at rest

588
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,159
and the transmission across sensor data

589
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,840
across open up open public networks is

590
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,039
encrypted you'll need to make sure you

591
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,440
have up-to-date malware protection on

592
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,919
any on any systems that can conceivably

593
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
process sensitive data

594
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
you need to practice send assistance

595
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,880
hardening each user will need

596
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,799
their own account

597
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
sensitive data will need to be

598
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,280
limited by need to know access would

599
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
need to be limited by need to know and

600
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,880
you'll need to restrict physical access

601
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
to that sensitive data

602
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,559
you'll need to provide logging in log

603
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,360
management vulnerability management both

604
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
internal and external scans as i

605
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,080
mentioned

606
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,679
and you'll need to do continual risk

607
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,120
assessment and documentation

608
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
the good news is those are all things

609
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,960
that most organizations

610
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,799
should be doing if they're not already

611
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,080
anyhow so it really doesn't involve a

612
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
great deal

613
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
of unusual work there are no

614
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
oddities that you really need to contend

615
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
with

616
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,640
again perform regular reviews at least

617
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,799
annually and you'll need to do another

618
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,559
one if you make any major changes to

619
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,280
infrastructure

620
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
in summary security frameworks are a

621
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,080
roadmap for developing a security

622
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
program

623
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,159
upon available resources some more

624
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,559
established frameworks may not be viable

625
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,039
for smaller organizations like the one i

626
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,320
work for

627
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,679
the important thing is to find a

628
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,799
framework that you like and work with it

629
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,039
and the pci dss

630
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,480
which has been developed to secure

631
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,559
payment card data

632
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,320
can be leveraged to create a viable

633
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
security framework for small and

634
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,799
medium-sized organizations and we're

635
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,240
enjoying the fruits of that every day

636
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,000
thank you for coming to talk my contact

637
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,320
information is there a copy of the

638
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
slides will be made available i think

639
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
we'll have a link to that somewhere

640
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
and if you have any questions don't

641
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
hesitate to reach out and contact me

642
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,360
thank you very much
