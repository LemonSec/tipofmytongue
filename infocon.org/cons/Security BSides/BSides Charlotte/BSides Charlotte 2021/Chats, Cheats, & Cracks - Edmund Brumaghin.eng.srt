1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,399
hello b-sides and thank you for

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,480
attending my talk uh chats cheats and

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,639
cracks abusive collaboration platforms

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,880
and malware campaigns so today i want to

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,559
talk a little bit about you know some of

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,239
the changes that we've seen in employee

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,920
workflows and uh corporate

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
communications since the start of the

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
covet 19 pandemic and kind of some of

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
the impact that it's had on the global

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,119
threat landscape i want to talk about

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,439
how some of the collaboration platforms

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,160
that organizations are now heavily using

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
uh for uh official community uh

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,719
communications employee communications

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,399
and things like that are being abused by

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
adversaries throughout different stages

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,360
of the malware life cycle uh across

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
different malware campaigns different

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
malware types and things of that nature

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,239
i want to kind of break it into three

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
kind of main phases of uh your standard

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
malware infection i want to start out by

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,039
talking about malware delivery or you

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,360
know how the malware is initially

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
getting to the victim

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,399
then i want to talk about component

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
retrieval which is kind of you know what

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
happens during and after the infection

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
process is occurring so in a lot of

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
cases nowadays right malware infections

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
aren't single stage individual files

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,360
being delivered to a victim in many

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
cases the malware infection process uh

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
takes place over multiple distinct

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
stages with various components being

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
delivered to different you know systems

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,759
throughout the infection life cycle and

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
then i want to finish by talking a

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,360
little bit about command and control and

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,640
some of the post-infection

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,720
communications data exfiltration and

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
things like that

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
so just a little bit about myself my

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,079
name is edmund brummagen i am a security

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,720
researcher with cisco talos uh so i

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
focus on malware research and threat

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
intelli so i love malware that's that's

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,799
what i spend my time working with uh

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
while you know a lot of folks spend

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640
their time trying to prevent malware

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
infections i find that i spend a lot of

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
my days trying to infect systems with

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,159
malware intentionally so that i can

55
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
analyze it figure out what it does and

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,560
you know help keep our customers safe

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,880
i've been with talos for over five years

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
now prior to that i spent a decade in

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,799
security operations i've held pretty

60
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,719
much every role you can hold on a sock

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,840
team

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
up to and including you know team

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,679
leading uh security operations teams i

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
also like to do embedded systems

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
research iot related research and things

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
like that it's it's something that i

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
find very interesting and love learning

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
more about

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
so let's dive right in let's talk a

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
little bit about what we've seen since

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
the kovic 19 pandemic started

72
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
so obviously one of the major shifts for

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,959
a lot of organizations was the move to

74
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
kind of remote employment uh situations

75
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
where employees are working remotely

76
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
where you know in the past they may have

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
been sitting in an office with you know

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
their co-workers and so one of the

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
natural byproducts of this change has

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,120
been that organizations have had to

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
increasingly rely on uh collaborative

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,239
communications platforms to facilitate

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
uh you know employee communication so

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
that uh co-workers can you know discuss

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
uh work-related topics uh so two of the

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
the biggest uh platforms that we've seen

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,959
kind of be adopted throughout the

88
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,680
pandemic have been uh discord and slack

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
uh so discord right that's where the

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
this event is being held it's being used

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,760
uh increasingly for a lot of

92
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
professional uh types of communications

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
historically it's it's mainly been used

94
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
in kind of the gaming community uh and

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
in hobbyist uh organizations to

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,599
allow you know different individuals to

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
communicate but nowadays it's being used

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,599
for a lot of professional uh events as

99
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,519
well security conferences if you think

100
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
of a lot of the virtual conferences that

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,879
we've held over the past you know year

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,640
and a half or so a lot of them have

103
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
taken place with the primary means of

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,959
communication being discord that's how

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,640
attendees are able to communicate that's

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
how speakers are able to answer

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
questions that's how events are

108
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
coordinated so we're definitely seeing

109
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,760
it in more than just you know personal

110
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
uh communications um capacities it's

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,239
being used for professional purposes as

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,440
well it's one of the largest

113
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
communications platforms out there um

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,599
according to discord at the time that

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
that we really kind of dug into um how

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
these platforms are being used they

117
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,720
they uh boasted about 140 million

118
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,799
monthly users so the the footprint is is

119
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
pretty wide for for discord uh another

120
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
one of the the very common platforms out

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
there is slack this is uh kind of been

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
geared more towards uh professional

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,120
communications it's used in a lot of

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
organizations to allow a team-based

125
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
collaboration

126
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
and things of that nature uh right now

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
they boast about 10 million daily users

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
so again the the user base is pretty

129
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
significant and it's only exploded in

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
popularity since you know it's kind of

131
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
been necessitated by the the change in

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
employee workflows that we've seen over

133
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
the past year and a half

134
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
so one of the the natural byproducts of

135
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
new platforms gaining popularity is that

136
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
adversaries are constantly on the

137
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
lookout to try to identify ways to

138
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
leverage this newfound popularity to

139
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
leverage these platforms for nefarious

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
purposes uh and in the case of discord

141
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
and slack and other collaboration

142
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
platforms we've seen it heavily abused

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,759
by a variety of different threat actors

144
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
for the purposes of malware distribution

145
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,840
so this slide just kind of gives you a

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
list of a few of the different malware

147
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
families that we've seen

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
leveraging either discord or slack at

149
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,720
some point throughout the infection

150
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,039
process you've got steelers like agent

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,080
tesla

152
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,919
you've got remote access trojans like

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
async rat nano core you know some of the

154
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960
the commodity malware that we see pretty

155
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
heavily distributed across the the

156
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
global threat landscape at any given

157
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
point in time but one of the major

158
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,120
shifts we saw was a increased reliance

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,759
on the part of nefarious actors uh on

160
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
these collaboration platforms to

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
facilitate the infection process and and

162
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
also to to manage the infections once

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
they've occurred and the systems are

164
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,479
under the threat actors control

165
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
so let's start with talking about

166
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
malware delivery i kind of mentioned

167
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
this earlier but this is really

168
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
referring to how the malware is

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
initially being delivered to the victim

170
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,160
how it's making its way to uh systems uh

171
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,880
to initiate the infection process

172
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
so one of the the things that that

173
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
really needs to be understand is kind of

174
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
how some of the functionality uh takes

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
place within these platforms because it

176
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,680
it makes it a little bit more

177
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
understandable as to why it's

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
been viewed as such an attractive

179
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
mechanism for adversaries so if you take

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,319
the example of discord right discord

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,560
supports you know servers anyone can

182
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
sign up with a with an email account

183
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,720
they can create new servers and within

184
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
those servers they have channels and

185
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
that's the the primary mechanism that's

186
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
used to communicate

187
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
between different members of the server

188
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
so discord supports the attachment of

189
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,039
different contents within the server

190
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,880
channels uh that that may have been

191
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
created by the server administrator

192
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
but you know are free to create anyone

193
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
can create as many as they want there's

194
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
really no limitation no barrier to entry

195
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,759
so when you attach files within discord

196
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
channels one thing that not a lot of

197
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,880
people realize is that there aren't any

198
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
access controls uh in place on that

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
content so in this example i created a

200
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
discord server and inside the discord

201
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,319
server i created a channel called

202
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,039
dumpster fire so this in this example i

203
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
just attached a an animated gif of a

204
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,000
dumpster fire right it's very fitting uh

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but the thing about attaching contents

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
within discord is that if you know the

207
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
url to the the location where that

208
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
resource is actually housed on the

209
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
content delivery network uh you don't

210
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
have to be a member of the server you

211
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
don't even have to have discord

212
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
installed but if you know that url you

213
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
can access that content directly

214
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,599
something to keep in mind you know even

215
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
as a discord user that if you're

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
attaching files or other content that

217
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,680
maybe you meant

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
only for the members of that that server

219
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,759
there's really nothing in place to

220
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,759
prevent anyone else who has access to

221
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,400
that url or knows what the url location

222
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
is from accessing that same content so

223
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
malware uh distributors have recognized

224
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,919
that this is uh really attractive for

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
malware distribution so right instead of

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
an animated gif they can attach a

227
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,879
malicious file a word document

228
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,479
or any other sort of content that they

229
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
that they would like to be able to

230
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,919
distribute and they can take advantage

231
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
of the same functionality they can

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
create a server attach their content

233
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,360
retrieve the uh cdn url and then use

234
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,919
that in their distribution campaigns

235
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
and uh one of the direct byproducts of

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
you know taking this sort of an approach

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
is that now adversaries are able to

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
deliver potentially malicious content to

239
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
potential victims uh over you know a tls

240
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,160
encrypted communications pathway uh

241
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,240
likewise they're able to host it on a

242
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
legitimate uh domain so if you're

243
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,479
looking at this

244
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,160
and you're trying to identify you know

245
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,120
detection uh possibilities here you know

246
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,879
it looks just like any legitimate

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,279
discord based communications look the

248
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,200
files are being served directly from the

249
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,760
discord content delivery network over

250
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
tls encrypted tunnels so it presents a

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,880
variety of different

252
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
um hurdles for defenders that are trying

253
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
to prevent this sort of activity from

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
you know reaching their users it can

255
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,839
circumvent a lot of perimeter security

256
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
controls that an organization may have

257
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
in place

258
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
so i don't want to just pick on discord

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
right because it's not the only platform

260
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
that supports this functionality uh

261
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,399
slack supports the exact same

262
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
functionality right an adversary can

263
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
create a slack instance they can create

264
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,399
channels within the slack instance and

265
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
then they can attach files there now one

266
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
of the main differences with slack is

267
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
that you actually have to do something

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,800
for the files to be publicly available

269
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,519
um so in the case of slack you attach

270
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
content to the slack instance and you

271
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
generate a public link for the file you

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
can see an example of that on the slide

273
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
here where once you've attached content

274
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
you generate a public link and then

275
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,399
anyone on the internet

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
that's able to access that url they

277
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
don't need to be authenticated to the

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,360
slack instance they don't need to have

279
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
slack installed

280
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
they can access this these resources

281
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
from you know any system that they want

282
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
so here's an example of another animated

283
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
gif that you know i attached to a slack

284
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
instance generated a public link just to

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
kind of demonstrate that it's as easy as

286
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
accessing any other http based uh you

287
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
know resource on the internet if you

288
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,720
know the url you can access the the

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,800
contents and they're hosted on

290
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
legitimate domains again they're

291
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
retrieved over tls encrypted tunnels so

292
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,920
they present a lot of the same uh you

293
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
know hurdles for defenders that discord

294
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,399
does so in both cases adversaries have

295
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,920
recognized that this functionality is

296
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
available and they've begun leveraging

297
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,000
it to kind of facilitate that delivery

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
process to get the initial malicious

299
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
contents to potential victims

300
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,399
so

301
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
this is happening it's not isolated by

302
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
any means we're seeing a tremendous

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
explosion in the volume of this activity

304
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
that's you know being seen across the

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,279
threat landscape just to kind of give

306
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
you an example of you know just the the

307
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,399
the volume when we did the initial um

308
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,800
digging into the types of campaigns the

309
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
types of activity how much volume we

310
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
were seeing you know you could go to uh

311
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
virustotal you know a pretty widely

312
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,959
known uh malware repository and you

313
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
could simply do a behavioral

314
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,519
search for any samples that reach out to

315
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,680
the discord content delivery network and

316
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,640
you can see at the time there was about

317
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,680
17.5 000

318
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
distinct samples so just kind of shows

319
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
you what that activity was around the

320
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,320
end of april beginning of may so as i

321
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
was putting this uh presentation

322
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
together i went back and just did a more

323
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
recent check from you know within the

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
last week and i noticed that at this

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
point there are uh you know over 36 000

326
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,200
distinct samples just present within

327
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,959
virus total that exhibit this behavior

328
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,560
so just kind of shows that this is

329
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
pretty widespread at this point there

330
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
are a lot of adversaries that are

331
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,519
starting to take advantage of this

332
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,440
functionality because you know it

333
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,279
affords them a lot of the benefits i've

334
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
you know previously described as far as

335
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
uh being able to encrypt the contents

336
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,079
that are being delivered as well as

337
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,800
being able to host them on legitimate uh

338
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
you know server side infrastructure that

339
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,720
may not be uh blocked in a lot of

340
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
organizational environments

341
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
so just to kind of put it in in

342
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
perspective you know here's a couple

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
tweets from uh late last month uh in

344
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,839
august uh from abuse.ch where you know

345
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,000
they were even then identifying wide

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
scale abuse of this functionality in

347
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
this case these were drydex campaigns

348
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
that were being hosted on the discord

349
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,160
cdn um again it it's it's become very

350
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,839
attractive and as a result we've seen an

351
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,240
explosion in this type of of activity in

352
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
uh once again not just to pick on

353
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
discord we're also seeing the same

354
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,519
activity leveraging the slack content

355
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
delivery network as well right as these

356
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
platforms have gotten popular um you

357
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
know they're not just popular with the

358
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,839
uh

359
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,200
the the

360
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
organizations that use them they also

361
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
become popular with nefarious uh actors

362
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
as well

363
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
so one of the primary mechanisms we've

364
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,480
seen this delivery phase um is with the

365
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
use of email that's that's one of the

366
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
most common uh initial attack vectors

367
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,839
that we see using this sort of

368
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,680
functionality uh you can kind of see a

369
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
snapshot of some of the volumetric

370
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
information uh within our telemetry uh

371
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
you know as far as the the sheer volume

372
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,839
of emails that contain uh resources that

373
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
reach out to the discord content

374
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,519
delivery network or the the slack

375
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
content delivery network and you can see

376
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
it was fairly steady fairly low volume

377
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
up until around the april 2020 time

378
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,040
frame

379
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,839
again that coincides around with when a

380
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,079
lot of the remote work from home type of

381
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,760
arrangements were being implemented and

382
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,279
more organizations started to heavily

383
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,600
rely on this technology and uh this

384
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
trend has continued we're continuing to

385
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
see this explosion because uh it's it's

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
attractive to adversaries and as a

387
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
result we're seeing more and more and

388
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,720
more uh malware campaigns that are

389
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
leveraging it

390
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
so one of the the main techniques we've

391
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,560
kind of seen from email based attacks

392
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
that leverage this is the use of

393
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
compressed archives so the idea here is

394
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
that the the adversary will send an

395
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
email to a potential victim or you know

396
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
a group of potential victims and those

397
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,680
emails will contain links to resources

398
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,000
hosted directly on discord or slacks uh

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,399
content delivery networks uh and in a

400
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
lot of cases we were seeing the file

401
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
formats being used uh were various

402
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
compressed uh archive file formats using

403
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
a variety of different compression

404
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,079
algorithms when you think about it it

405
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,920
makes a lot of sense right they put a

406
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
link to it in an email uh that link

407
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,920
points to a compressed archive so that

408
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
when the contents being delivered to the

409
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
victim a byproduct of the compression

410
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,079
process is that it obfuscates the

411
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
contents of the data that's being

412
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,600
delivered right when you think about as

413
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,680
the archive or you know

414
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
something of that nature when you look

415
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
at it you're not seeing strings you're

416
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
not getting a lot of clues as to what

417
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,160
the underlying functionality might be to

418
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
be able to deduce whether or not it's

419
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,720
malicious or benign in nature and so

420
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
that's kind of one of the the main

421
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,079
strategies we've seen adversaries

422
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
leverage is they'll compress the

423
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
contents uh they'll host it in uh

424
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,279
discorder slacks content delivery

425
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,800
network and then they'll put a link to

426
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
those files in their emails and send

427
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
them to victims

428
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,800
so here's an example of a german email

429
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,639
campaign that that we observed when we

430
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
were doing a lot of the research into

431
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
how this is being abused

432
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
you can see it's fairly standard uh

433
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
malicious spam or mouse spam right uh

434
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,600
they're trying to convince the victim to

435
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
open the attached file in this case uh

436
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
you can see there's a an image there it

437
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
looks like a pdf is being attached to

438
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
the email uh but they did uh something a

439
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,360
little bit different right that's not an

440
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,519
actual file attachment what they did was

441
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,480
they

442
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,880
basically created a hyperlink to an iso

443
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
archive that was being hosted on the

444
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
discord content delivery network and

445
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,880
then they use the placeholder image with

446
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
that hyperlink within the html of the

447
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,600
email to make it look like it was a pdf

448
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,079
right to make it look a little bit more

449
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
believable to the victim that it's you

450
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
know a pdf a lot of potential victims

451
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
may not necessarily realize that pdfs

452
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
can be malicious they can contain

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,519
javascript and do a lot of the same

454
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,040
nasty things as

455
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
other file formats

456
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,480
so just kind of an interesting approach

457
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
but kind of shows uh the the myriad of

458
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
ways that this functionality is being

459
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
abused um very similar we see a lot of

460
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
different mouse familiars they pretend

461
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
to be purchase orders or invoices or

462
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
other financial related documents that

463
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,360
victims would be interested in accessing

464
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
um you know in an attempt to get the the

465
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
victim to access the content within the

466
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
discord or slack cdns to initiate that

467
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
infection process

468
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
so that kind of talk uh walk through

469
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,240
some of the delivery stage type of

470
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,079
activity that we've really seen the

471
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,440
types of techniques that we're seeing in

472
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
the wild so let's talk about what

473
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
happens during the infection process

474
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
because we're also seeing a lot of

475
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,759
reliance on these same communications

476
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
platforms throughout different stages of

477
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,320
a typical malware infection

478
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
so here's an example where

479
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,320
during the initial

480
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,279
stage execution of a particular malware

481
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
campaign uh what we observed was the

482
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,680
malware would reach out to the discord

483
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
content delivery network to attempt to

484
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,519
retrieve content that would be used

485
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
during the stage two execution of the

486
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,440
malware so you can see there's an http

487
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,839
get request made out to a specific

488
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,079
resource located within the the content

489
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,639
delivery network of discord and so you

490
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,639
can see the response content returned to

491
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,279
the victim it's just an ascii blob right

492
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,759
so if you're looking at this uh from a

493
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
network uh traffic analysis perspective

494
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
right you're not really seeing anything

495
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,199
that's super indicative that this is

496
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,199
malicious in nature and that's because

497
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,279
one of the steps that the adversary took

498
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,360
to obfuscate their activity was they

499
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
used an xor based objuscation mechanism

500
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,199
so

501
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,720
what would happen is they would retrieve

502
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
this ascii blob they would reverse the

503
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,039
xor process and then they would inject

504
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,280
that into a process that they had

505
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
started on the victim system so they

506
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
were using process injection they would

507
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
reverse the the xor uh to generate a

508
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,400
usable payload inject that into the

509
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
running process on the system and then

510
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
execute that second stage so in this

511
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
case that was

512
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,039
associated with rimcos if you're not

513
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,360
familiar with rimcos it's a commercially

514
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
available remote access trojan uh it's

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
developed and sold by a company called

516
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
breaking security a colleague and i did

517
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,679
quite a bit of research into this

518
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
organization and the different uh

519
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,840
products that they sell um so if you're

520
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
interested uh you know get with me i can

521
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,360
i can drop you a link to the the

522
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
research we published there but

523
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,160
uh that's what the uh final payload was

524
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
in this case uh and you can kind of see

525
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
uh right here is one of the examples of

526
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,840
some of the registry keys that are

527
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
created by the rimcos rat uh in this

528
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
case one of the things that they do is

529
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
they create a registry key

530
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
and then they drop the um

531
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,039
the user's license key

532
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,320
that they were issued by the company

533
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
that makes this rat in there so you can

534
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,480
you can clearly see that this was a

535
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,160
rimco's payload

536
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,080
so in this particular case what they

537
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
were doing was they were achieving

538
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
persistence through the use of registry

539
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
run keys so persistence allows them to

540
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
re-execute the malware each time the

541
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,440
system reboots which allows them to

542
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
retain that foothold on the victim

543
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
system across system reboots and things

544
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,039
of that nature so in this case they were

545
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,640
creating a registry run key one of the

546
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
most common persistence mechanisms we

547
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,200
see

548
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
but they put a little bit of a twist on

549
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
it right instead of pointing directly to

550
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,559
a rimcost binary what they were doing

551
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
was they were pointing that run key to a

552
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,720
windows shortcut file uh so when you go

553
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
and look at the windows shortcut file

554
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,919
file that's what actually was pointing

555
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,400
to the malicious executable on disk so

556
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
each time the system reboots rimco kicks

557
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,559
back off establishes connectivity with

558
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
the uh attacker's commanding control

559
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,679
server in this case they were using

560
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
dynamic dns based uh surface side

561
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
infrastructure to facilitate command and

562
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
control data exfiltration

563
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,400
basically stealing sensitive information

564
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
from the victim and then exfiltrating it

565
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,520
out to the attacker so they can attempt

566
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,840
to monetize it

567
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,600
so here's another example in this case

568
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,480
with an office document uh so this was

569
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
an example of an office document where

570
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,760
they really didn't put a lot of effort

571
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
into uh you know dropping any content

572
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
into the document itself so there's no

573
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,840
like decoy image

574
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
there's really no content whatsoever uh

575
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,000
we can tell by the file name used that

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
this was a turkish

577
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
language campaign uh and if you look at

578
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,799
the the the actual file name itself it's

579
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,760
uh referencing nitro codes which are a

580
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
product uh associated with the discord

581
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
platform that'll allow premium features

582
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,640
to be used if uh discord users decide to

583
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,320
uh to purchase those uh one of the

584
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,240
common themes that we saw across a lot

585
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
of the the malware uh distribution

586
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
campaigns was that the lures would uh

587
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,360
try to entice victims to open uh the

588
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
contents of malicious files by claiming

589
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,480
to

590
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,840
be a way for the victim to generate

591
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
nitro codes to unlock those premium

592
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,559
features without having to pay

593
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,400
so in this particular case when you open

594
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
the the document you can see there's a

595
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,720
document open macro so when the document

596
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
opens the macros kick off and begin

597
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,200
executing uh code on the victim system

598
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
in this case they they uh did a

599
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,159
somewhat primitive uh obfuscation of the

600
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
macro contents to try to uh make it a

601
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
little bit more difficult to analyze

602
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
what was actually taking place but when

603
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
you de-obvious skate those macros

604
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
they're effectively calling the windows

605
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
command processor uh they're using that

606
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,320
to invoke powershell and then they're

607
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
using powershell to go retrieve the next

608
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
stage of the infection process in this

609
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,400
case from the discord content delivery

610
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,919
network so the additional components

611
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,000
that are used in this case were also

612
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
being hosted on discord's content

613
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
delivery network so they could be

614
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
retrieved doing during the infection

615
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,679
process uh stored locally on the system

616
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,840
and then executed to kind of kick off

617
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
the next stage of the the attack in this

618
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
case it was an async rack campaign

619
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
and you can kind of see an example of

620
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,960
what that looks like from a network

621
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,280
perspective here you can see the http

622
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,880
get request that the macros in the

623
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
document make and then you can see the

624
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
response content that's delivered by the

625
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
discord content delivery network server

626
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,799
you can see the the mz header and the

627
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,400
dos stub there so

628
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
clearly this is a malicious executable

629
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
that's being delivered when the the

630
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,520
office document is open by a potential

631
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
victim

632
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
so here's just another example in this

633
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,720
case a pdf so this is meekmill.pdf

634
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
not again not a lot of uh effort put

635
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
into you know trying to craft contents

636
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,840
within the pdf itself um in this case it

637
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
just says i love you uh when you open

638
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
the uh the pdf up it prompts the user to

639
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,640
allow uh remote content and it can it

640
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
shows that it's attempting to connect to

641
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
the discord content delivery network and

642
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
in this case you can simply run strings

643
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
on the uh the pdf to get an idea of

644
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,320
what's taking place here you can see the

645
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
the app launch url uh string there and

646
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
then you can see directly the url to the

647
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
malicious executable that's going to be

648
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,039
used in the next stage of the infection

649
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,080
process

650
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
so when the pdfs open and the user

651
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,760
clicks allow

652
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
it reaches out to the discord cdn pulls

653
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,799
down the next stage executable and then

654
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
kicks it off on the system uh

655
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,720
helping further progress the infection

656
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
process

657
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,200
so not to to be contained simply with

658
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
windows now we're also seeing this

659
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
leveraged in iot botnets

660
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,480
so

661
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,919
in this particular case this was the

662
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,480
cubot iot botnet

663
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
this activity was consistent with what

664
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,559
we've seen uh during and following the

665
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
exploitation of some widely known widely

666
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,280
abused yarn-based vulnerabilities

667
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,360
in this case what the the iot malware

668
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
was doing on the embedded linux system

669
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
is it was reaching out to discord to

670
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
pull down additional modules uh to

671
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,039
infect the system with and join it to as

672
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,520
a node within the the iot botnet so

673
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
we're seeing this across the board it's

674
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
uh you know across a myriad of different

675
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
types of threats you know windows

676
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
malware uh even iot malware we're seeing

677
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,000
uh the lure documents uh use all of the

678
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
same types of file formats we've grown

679
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
accustomed to

680
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,799
only in the in these cases they're able

681
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,120
to directly take advantage of

682
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
organizational trust in

683
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,559
some of these collaboration platforms

684
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,039
like discord and slack

685
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,320
so let's talk a little bit about what

686
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
happens after the infection process

687
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
takes place so let's talk about c2 and

688
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
data x filtration right because most of

689
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,799
the time when malware infections occur

690
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,240
uh their

691
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,760
the adversary behind the malware

692
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
campaign has a mission objective right

693
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,360
they want to try to

694
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,720
achieve that mission objective through

695
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
the use of malware distribution uh

696
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
infecting potential victims with malware

697
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,039
for the purposes of something uh with a

698
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,400
lot of the the malware that we see

699
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
taking advantage of these platforms it's

700
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
financially motivated uh you know

701
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,159
crimeware um so in a lot of cases the um

702
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,919
mission objective of the adversary is to

703
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,320
try to generate revenue somehow by

704
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
infecting systems across the internet uh

705
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,679
whether that's stealing sensitive

706
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
information that they can then sell to

707
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
um or or otherwise monetize or you know

708
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,799
through the use of ransomware where um

709
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,159
you know it's effectively digital

710
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,520
extortion where they can generate

711
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
revenue um from victims by locking them

712
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
out of you know their systems uh you

713
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,960
know there's a myriad of different ways

714
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
that this is is approached and one of

715
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,360
the the key characteristics is that in a

716
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
lot of these cases there's some

717
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
command and control mechanism that's

718
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
required for

719
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
the adversary to control those

720
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
infections once they've achieved a

721
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,799
malware infection on a victim system

722
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,720
so one of the primary ways that we see

723
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,799
this uh used by adversaries is through

724
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,120
the use of what are called web hooks so

725
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
web hooks are effectively an api

726
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
interface

727
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
into discord and slack that allow

728
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
discordant slack users to interact with

729
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,080
the collaboration platform and with

730
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,559
their server their discord server their

731
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,200
slack instance without having to install

732
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
the the client application on their

733
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
system so it's used for a lot of

734
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,799
automation type tasks right you can uh

735
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,480
create a robot that you know does

736
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,919
certain things and then you can use a

737
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,000
web hook to communicate with that with

738
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,679
that bot that may be present within the

739
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,919
disk or slack server that that you're

740
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,559
using um so this this is also an

741
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,960
attractive mechanism for establishing a

742
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
bi-directional command and control uh

743
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
communications pathway with infected

744
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
systems uh we're seeing it uh used in a

745
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
variety of different applications across

746
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,080
the different malware that's you know

747
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,559
being distributed around the world so

748
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,000
this is kind of what an example of what

749
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
a common discord web hook might look

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
like right you've got a uri structure

751
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,039
you can see discord.com api web hooks

752
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
and then there's an alphanumeric string

753
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,919
that

754
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,600
allows the the communications to be

755
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,240
brokered and to land on in the location

756
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
within discord where you want it to

757
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,360
right a channel and a server somewhere

758
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,679
or something like that uses this uh same

759
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,760
kind of format uh when you think about

760
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
it from a command control perspective

761
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,799
right it's obvious why this is

762
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,880
attractive to adversaries they don't

763
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,840
have to stand up their own

764
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,039
infrastructure they don't have to

765
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,640
maintain or manage server-side

766
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,960
infrastructure and they don't have to

767
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
worry about their infrastructure being

768
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
blocked as easily because they're taking

769
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,240
direct advantage of legitimate platforms

770
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
so organizations that allow discord

771
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
communications are also going to allow

772
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,240
um communications with these web hooks

773
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
and and here's another example a similar

774
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
type of concept just with slack it

775
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
supports the same type of automation

776
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,200
framework

777
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
uh we see it used pretty pretty heavily

778
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,240
across the uh the threat landscape

779
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
so here's an example of some of the

780
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,760
communications that i captured when i

781
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,919
was analyzing some malware that uh

782
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,919
communicated with discord uh post

783
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,520
infection right you can see

784
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
this was captured with burp where i had

785
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,679
an infected system and i was made in the

786
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,840
middling the https communications

787
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,919
between that system and the discord

788
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,760
platform that the malware was attempting

789
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
to communicate with you can see this

790
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
allowed the adversary to retrieve status

791
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,320
updates so as new system infections were

792
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,480
achieved as they infected new systems

793
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,320
those systems would reach out to the uh

794
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
the adversary over discord and they

795
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
would uh spit a bunch of information

796
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,919
about the system to the adversary so

797
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,840
that you know if the adversary is in

798
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,919
discord they have a channel going new

799
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,440
infections are popping in so they're

800
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,919
seeing uh that information in real time

801
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,000
as they're able to infect new systems uh

802
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,919
so you can see uh what that looks like

803
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,679
de obfuscated on the right hand pane

804
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
there uh in this particular case uh they

805
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,360
were giving a little bit of information

806
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
about the system and then they were

807
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,840
giving them the port map.io

808
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,200
communications channel that the

809
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
adversary could then connect to to

810
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,039
further administer uh the malware in

811
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,399
this case

812
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,559
so port map is one of the most common

813
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,640
um you know traffic obfuscation

814
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,120
mechanisms that's kind of become popular

815
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,960
across a lot of the commodity malware

816
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
we've seen we've seen several instances

817
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,279
where malware supports uh communicating

818
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,039
with the attackers command and control

819
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
infrastructure over port map or there's

820
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
other solutions out there that operate

821
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,679
similarly like in grok and others so uh

822
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,679
this the way that this works is that it

823
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,919
enables the adversary to obfuscate where

824
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,520
their server-side infrastructure is

825
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
actually being located by using these

826
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,520
services to broker the communications to

827
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,679
kind of sit in the middle and shield

828
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,279
the victim from where their their

829
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,360
traffic is actually ending up so the way

830
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
this works is the attacker stands up

831
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
their c2 server and they establish an

832
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
open vpn connection to the port

833
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,679
portmap.io platform

834
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,120
so when they infect the system with

835
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
malware the victim doesn't directly

836
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,559
communicate with the attacker's c2

837
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,399
infrastructure they

838
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,559
connect to a specific

839
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
portmap.io domain and then the port map

840
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
service is responsible for providing

841
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,559
that back-end brokering of the

842
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,480
communications that translation process

843
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,039
if you will so the request is then

844
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,039
forwarded on the back end to the c2

845
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,200
server itself and any communications

846
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,679
from c2 back to the victim are likewise

847
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,760
obfuscated using this port map or

848
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,399
ingrock service so you can see from an

849
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,880
ir perspective or a malware analysis

850
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
perspective when you're you know looking

851
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,399
at the malware trying to identify c2

852
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,880
infrastructure all you're seeing is http

853
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,159
communications or other types of

854
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,960
communications to the port map dot io

855
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,120
service and are unable to actually

856
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,480
identify where that backend

857
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,399
infrastructure may live makes it more

858
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,640
resilient makes it harder to uh to take

859
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,440
down it makes uh makes it less risky

860
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
from a law enforcement intervention

861
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
standpoint

862
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
so one of the other interesting examples

863
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,360
of commanding control over discord that

864
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,080
i saw was through the use of

865
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,440
discord web hooks uh and wmi commands on

866
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
the infected system so the idea here was

867
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,960
that the malware would write a batch

868
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,640
file onto the system during the

869
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,799
infection process that batch file would

870
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,880
be responsible for executing a bunch of

871
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
different wmi commands to retrieve

872
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,279
various uh information about the

873
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,440
endpoint that information would then be

874
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
written into text files on the infected

875
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
system and then those text files would

876
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,000
be read line by line and sent to the

877
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
attacker's discord server over a discord

878
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,960
web hook so it was a bi-directional

879
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
command execution uh response request

880
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,159
type of channel that was established

881
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,799
entirely using discord web hooks

882
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,240
so you can kind of see an example of

883
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,320
what this looks like dynamically here

884
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
where i've got an infected system that's

885
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,399
that's running this malware wmi is

886
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,279
executing a daemon called uh discord

887
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,559
send web hook is running that's

888
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,480
basically reading those text files line

889
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
by line and then transmitting them over

890
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,799
uh discord web hooks and you can see an

891
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,720
example of one of the post requests to

892
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,640
this discord web hook you can see it's

893
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,399
saying you know please wait while the

894
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,880
wmi commands are being executed uh and

895
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,840
then you can see um as that wmi

896
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,679
information is being read line by line

897
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,039
it's being transmitted you can see the

898
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,440
creation class equals 132 underscore

899
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
operating system so we see wmi used

900
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
pretty commonly for

901
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,799
survey information collecting

902
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
information about an infected system and

903
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
then sending it to an adversary

904
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,960
as part of the bot registration process

905
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,520
so another example was with uh leak gap

906
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
which uh which is a pay to decrypt uh

907
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,080
ransomware variant um so in this

908
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,440
particular case what they were doing is

909
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
they were infecting the system with

910
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,480
ransomware and then periodically

911
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,159
throughout the infection process as the

912
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,320
files are being encrypted uh different

913
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,120
status updates and ongoing um updates

914
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,880
about the malware's operation were being

915
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
transmitted to the adversary over uh

916
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
discord web hooks you can see uh you

917
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,919
know delete gap info from and then it uh

918
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
you know has host name password and

919
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,600
different information about the infected

920
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,679
system it's got key information that the

921
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,360
adversary can use to manage the

922
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,200
encryption and decryption keys if they

923
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,799
have a myriad of different victims and

924
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,080
they need to keep that information

925
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,640
straight so they know how to uh how the

926
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,399
what key was used for encryption so they

927
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
can manage you know puts possibly

928
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,919
providing decryption information if the

929
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,519
victim chooses to pay the extortion

930
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
demand

931
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,799
and here you can see another example of

932
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,279
that uh where the leap gap ransomware is

933
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,880
actually reporting that it's initiated

934
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,200
the uh file encryption process back to

935
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,720
the adversary so that they can see

936
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,480
exactly where they are in the infection

937
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
chained at any given point in time so

938
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
just a few different unique ways that we

939
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,440
are seeing discord uh used directly as a

940
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,039
command and control channel for a

941
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,640
variety of different types of malware

942
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,720
out there again it's very attractive

943
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,080
because of the different functionality

944
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,320
it provides it's very robust and it

945
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,000
allows the adversary to take advantage

946
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
of legitimate infrastructure so if they

947
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,159
were standing at their own c2

948
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,320
pretty easy to block the domain ip

949
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
address and things like that but they're

950
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,679
relying on the fact that a lot of

951
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,159
organizations may not be blocking

952
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,480
connectivity to slack or discord so

953
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,760
they're able to take advantage of that

954
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,919
to circumvent um in a lot of cases

955
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
otherwise pretty stringent perimeter

956
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,159
security controls

957
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,960
and so in the case of uh leak uh leak

958
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,799
gap uh you know this is the ransom note

959
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,120
that's that's being displayed uh fairly

960
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,799
straightforward just says hey don't

961
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,960
reboot um your your files have been

962
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,399
encrypted and your master boot records

963
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,080
been overwritten pay us this amount of

964
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
bitcoin to the specific wallet and send

965
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,120
us an email with this key um you know

966
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
you know just as the the extortion

967
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
component of the the ransomware itself

968
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,399
so i also want to talk a little bit

969
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
about token and cookie stealing uh

970
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,080
because this is another area that we're

971
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,880
seeing a lot of malicious activity

972
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,840
so let's talk about token steelers so in

973
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,760
a lot of cases what we see is that the

974
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
access tokens uh used to

975
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,320
programmatically interact with discord

976
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,640
slack other collaboration platforms are

977
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,279
often stored in plain text on systems so

978
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,600
that makes them very trivial to grab so

979
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,919
if you're a threat actor and you're

980
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,240
trying to get tokens so that you can

981
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,640
impersonate users so that you can you

982
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,320
know leverage those tokens in your own

983
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
malware to to maintain some level of

984
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,000
anonymity you don't have to you know

985
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
sign up for your own account you can

986
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,720
just take advantage of a victim's

987
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
account the idea here is that

988
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,559
adversaries are infecting systems with

989
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,559
these token steelers often under the

990
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,919
guise of you know game cheats or uh game

991
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,399
cracks uh to attempt to obtain that

992
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,880
token so that they can use that token uh

993
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,039
to further communicate with discord in

994
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,279
the context of the the victim in this

995
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,240
case

996
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,159
so they're very very easy to implement

997
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
because there's not a lot of client side

998
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,000
protection on these tokens if you can

999
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,279
get malware if you can get code

1000
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,240
execution on a victim system and they've

1001
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,519
authenticated to one of these

1002
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,120
collaboration platforms and they have a

1003
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,119
token stored locally

1004
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,960
that steeler can just grab that token

1005
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
send it to the adversary and then the

1006
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
attacker can directly begin to leverage

1007
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,440
the same tokens um so at this point uh

1008
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,280
at the at the time that the that we

1009
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,040
really dug into a lot of the token

1010
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,399
stealing there really wasn't any sort of

1011
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,879
client verification taking place so uh

1012
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,639
not really anything that would pose a

1013
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,159
barrier to entry for this type of

1014
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,239
activity

1015
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,719
so uh why would adversaries kind of like

1016
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,879
want these sort of tokens well uh you

1017
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,800
know and and what there's a variety of

1018
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,000
different things that they could be used

1019
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,359
for if you think about it from an

1020
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,000
adversary that's trying to infect other

1021
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
users with malware um being able to pose

1022
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,079
as one of those users contacts

1023
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
likely maximizes the chances that

1024
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,399
they'll be able to entice the victim to

1025
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,879
open whatever sort of file they attach

1026
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,040
within discord or slack right if you're

1027
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
a potential victim and you get a message

1028
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,000
from someone you know and talk to

1029
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,839
frequently and they say hey i've got

1030
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,359
this word document can you can you take

1031
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,040
a quick look at it maybe you're more

1032
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
likely to open that document than if it

1033
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
was some you know random discord account

1034
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,200
that you've never interacted with before

1035
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,520
so by being able to take these tokens

1036
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
and then impersonate users it allows

1037
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,599
them to more effectively social engineer

1038
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,040
other users of the collaboration

1039
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,160
platform

1040
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
likewise it also allows them to register

1041
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,440
discord web hooks and things like that

1042
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,680
so i mentioned one of the most common

1043
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,920
kind of lures or themes we see with with

1044
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,960
token stealing is the use of gaming

1045
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,599
related uh you know themes so they'll

1046
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,480
often pose as game cheats or game cracks

1047
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
in this case uh this this particular

1048
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,200
executable was called main craft gin

1049
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
so they were posing as a minecraft

1050
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,640
related

1051
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
utility that minecraft gamers could

1052
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,520
use to benefit them some way in the game

1053
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
so this was uh

1054
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
the main function associated with this

1055
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,119
particular malware and you can see one

1056
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,920
of the things that it does is it uses it

1057
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,160
establishes and generates a discord web

1058
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
hook and that's how it transmits

1059
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
back to the adversary in this case you

1060
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,880
can see webhook.send token

1061
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
this is where it sends a lot of the

1062
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
information that the steeler is able to

1063
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,839
collect back to the attacker so they can

1064
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,560
then begin to impersonate the user

1065
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,000
uh you can see this is where they're

1066
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
gathering the actual information on the

1067
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,800
uh the system itself and then uh you

1068
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,240
know this is where they're actually

1069
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,920
sending the token back to the the

1070
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,839
adversary you can see them formulating

1071
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,119
the http communications uh so these are

1072
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,200
very very readily uh available they're

1073
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
pretty easy to write so we see a ton of

1074
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
them um and here's just an example of a

1075
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,040
growtopia themed steeler where they're

1076
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
doing something very similar right

1077
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,079
they're collecting the information

1078
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,920
they're formulating a web hook request

1079
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,040
and then sending it back to the

1080
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,000
adversary over the discord web hook api

1081
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
which allows the adversary to then begin

1082
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,520
to directly take advantage of that

1083
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,200
information by impersonating their

1084
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,440
previous victims uh for a variety of

1085
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,079
nefarious purposes

1086
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,400
so discord's not the only platform that

1087
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,160
this applies to as well right it's kind

1088
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,760
of been a theme here that you know

1089
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
discord's one of the most popular

1090
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,240
platforms so we see a large amount of

1091
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,560
abuse in these various aspects of

1092
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,040
malware distribution malware infection

1093
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,359
post compromise activities but we're

1094
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,280
also seeing similar types of activity

1095
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,119
with slack and some of the other

1096
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,960
platforms as well right as platforms get

1097
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
popular uh they're typically not only

1098
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,320
popular for

1099
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,119
legitimate users they often um are also

1100
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,200
achieving uh increased levels of

1101
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,119
popularity with adversaries at the same

1102
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,760
time stealing slack tokens is a little

1103
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,599
bit more complicated but not by a whole

1104
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,160
lot there's um you know pretty easy

1105
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,760
mechanisms that can be used again once

1106
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,599
you get malware on a system

1107
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,200
you can steal uh

1108
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,680
the browser cookie the d cookie which is

1109
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
kind of the equivalent function within

1110
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
slack as the discord tokens i was

1111
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,440
previously you know describing in once

1112
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,520
you gain these tokens this allows you to

1113
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,000
download files even if they haven't had

1114
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,079
a public link created it allows you to

1115
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,000
access slack workspaces under the

1116
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,240
context of the compromised user it

1117
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,079
allows you to impersonate the user to

1118
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,920
communicate with other members of their

1119
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
slack instances

1120
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
which is pretty powerful when you think

1121
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,599
about a lot of the use cases for slack

1122
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,520
right it's used in a lot of corporate

1123
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
environments so being able to obtain a

1124
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
corporate user's slack token and

1125
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,359
impersonate that user

1126
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,320
is a

1127
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
an interesting way that an adversary can

1128
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
attempt to gain an initial foothold in

1129
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
an organizational environment and then

1130
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
leverage that communications pathway to

1131
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
you know contact the help desk to reset

1132
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
passwords or you know otherwise uh try

1133
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,480
to maximize their sphere of influence

1134
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
and there are also a lot of uh open

1135
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,320
source utilities that are available if

1136
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,560
you're interested in um getting more

1137
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
information about how the the slack

1138
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,839
tokens work and testing some of the

1139
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,520
functionality that you can achieve using

1140
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,960
that

1141
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,119
so that's a lot of information about the

1142
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,400
different ways we're seeing this

1143
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,880
functionality abused in various stages

1144
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,280
of you know the attack life cycle uh so

1145
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,720
what are some things that organizations

1146
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,880
can do well the good news is that there

1147
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,119
are a lot of the the same functions the

1148
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,200
same security controls that uh you know

1149
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
we we've typically recommended for other

1150
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,040
types of threats are directly applicable

1151
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
here as well so ensuring that you have a

1152
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
comprehensive remote access solution and

1153
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,560
that you're employing things like

1154
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
two-factor authentication uh where

1155
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
you're not just relying on token-based

1156
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
authentication but you also have a

1157
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,720
second factor um leveraging

1158
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,480
endpoint security controls so making

1159
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
sure that you have the ability to detect

1160
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,640
malicious activity on the endpoint i

1161
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,960
mentioned some of the attractiveness of

1162
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,359
these uh platforms is that they're

1163
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,119
inherently encrypted uh the

1164
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,560
communications are taking place with

1165
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,040
legitimate platform infrastructure

1166
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,280
so from a network perspective it may be

1167
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,839
difficult for you to identify this at

1168
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,560
the network traffic layer so in the case

1169
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
that this does get to an end point it's

1170
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,640
important that you have that layered

1171
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,119
security uh defense and depth type of

1172
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,040
architectural strategy in place that you

1173
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,520
can still detect when malicious code is

1174
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,359
executing on an endpoint right making

1175
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,040
sure your users are aware that just

1176
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,000
because

1177
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
you know discord and slack are an

1178
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
approved communications mechanism

1179
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,119
doesn't mean they should inherently

1180
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,040
trust anything they receive via these

1181
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,200
communications platforms right

1182
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,040
you know oftentimes users might think oh

1183
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,359
well i use slack it's legitimate there's

1184
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,960
probably some sort of

1185
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,640
comprehensive

1186
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,000
control in place to make sure that

1187
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
malicious content doesn't end up you

1188
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,720
know

1189
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,800
in a chat with me somewhere

1190
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,720
but the reality is we found that it's

1191
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,040
pretty trivial to host malicious

1192
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,560
contents on these content delivery

1193
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,119
networks and they're not actively being

1194
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,880
taken down with any

1195
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,280
level of expediency

1196
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
so in a lot of cases the payloads will

1197
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
sit there for a long time they're not

1198
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
being detected by the platform providers

1199
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,599
so you know making sure that users are

1200
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,520
aware that this threat vector exists and

1201
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,880
that they're thinking about it when they

1202
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
get messages from people they don't know

1203
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
or even if they're getting unexpected

1204
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
messages from people that they do know

1205
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,000
likewise here's just a snapshot of you

1206
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,200
know some of the different security

1207
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,720
controls that you can deploy at

1208
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,839
different layers of your defensive

1209
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,960
architecture to try to provide that

1210
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
comprehensive defense and depth type of

1211
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,400
approach making sure that you're

1212
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,640
inspecting the contents of emails making

1213
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
sure that you know you're using netflow

1214
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
analysis to identify you know data

1215
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,160
exfiltration

1216
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,680
that you're deploying comprehensive

1217
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,440
logging and centralized collection

1218
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,200
capabilities in the case of you know

1219
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,720
things like ransomware making sure that

1220
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,400
not only do you have a comprehensive

1221
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
backup and recovery strategy but you

1222
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,079
have an offline backup and recovery

1223
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,599
strategy and that you're testing it

1224
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,760
periodically to ensure that it continues

1225
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,079
to meet your recovery objectives as they

1226
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
change over time right organizations

1227
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,079
aren't static their environments aren't

1228
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,839
static and the systems that are

1229
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,880
important to the conduction of business

1230
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,560
objectives and mission objectives isn't

1231
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,079
static so making sure that you're

1232
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,160
continuously testing that to make sure

1233
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,040
it remains effective uh as those

1234
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,760
requirements as those needs change uh in

1235
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
ensuring that you're deploying a

1236
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,839
comprehensive network-based segmentation

1237
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,599
that you're segmenting assets of

1238
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,800
differing

1239
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,839
um

1240
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,079
importance in your environment it goes a

1241
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,480
really long way not in not only just for

1242
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,280
preventing uh you know a positive

1243
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,119
compromise or preventing successful

1244
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,960
compromise in your environment but that

1245
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,040
you're also maintaining the ability to

1246
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,920
detect if a compromise occurs uh and

1247
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
also more effectively respond to it and

1248
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
that's where network segmentation

1249
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,599
creating those inspection choke points

1250
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,359
creating those places in the environment

1251
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,119
where you can strategically deploy

1252
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,960
defenses allows you to remain more agile

1253
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,800
in your response it allows you to detect

1254
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,000
more quickly

1255
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
when things are going wrong before

1256
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,079
adversaries have you know a chance to

1257
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,079
operate towards longer term objectives

1258
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,760
once they get in it also helps you

1259
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,520
prevent that initial compromise from

1260
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,359
occurring in the first place

1261
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,359
so just some things to think about uh

1262
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,440
that you know organizations should be

1263
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,560
you know thinking about when they're

1264
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,160
deploying security controls when they're

1265
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,880
architecting their solutions uh likewise

1266
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
if you're an organization and you don't

1267
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,480
use discord for

1268
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,520
um you know specific official company

1269
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,680
communications you should probably think

1270
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,920
about blocking communications with the

1271
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,319
discord platform altogether likewise if

1272
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,960
you don't use slack the same applies if

1273
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,880
they're not used in your environment

1274
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,079
don't think that just because they're

1275
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,000
legitimate platforms there's no risk

1276
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,839
associated with them because as i've

1277
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,359
kind of demonstrated during this this

1278
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,040
presentation you know we're seeing

1279
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,200
adversaries take advantage of this

1280
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,920
across pretty much every major area of

1281
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,720
your typical type of attack so something

1282
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,800
to keep in mind uh you know lease

1283
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,720
functionality lease privilege concepts

1284
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,800
are are definitely the way to go here in

1285
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,640
terms of you know they're difficult to

1286
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,319
inspect so if you don't need them go

1287
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,440
ahead and just prevent the

1288
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,960
communications all together because

1289
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,920
it'll uh you know remove an entire um

1290
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
you know mechanism or method or

1291
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,359
technique that adversaries are finding

1292
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,480
increasingly attractive nowadays

1293
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
so shameless pitch right i work for uh

1294
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,720
for cisco talos um one of the things

1295
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,480
that we try to do is we try to make as

1296
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,400
much information available to the

1297
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,319
general public as we can when we see

1298
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,720
this sort of new type of attack or new

1299
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,200
malware um or you know new techniques

1300
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,880
being used and we try to put that

1301
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,400
information out there for the global

1302
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,880
security community um you know not just

1303
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,560
you know cisco customers but you know

1304
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,319
anyone who's interested in staying up to

1305
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,920
date on the latest types of threats that

1306
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,119
we're seeing the latest types of

1307
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,720
research that we're doing so you know

1308
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,079
here's just a few ways that you can kind

1309
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,920
of stay up to date via you know social

1310
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,640
media our blog podcasts uh things of

1311
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,880
that nature uh so definitely uh

1312
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,800
encourage you to check that out if if

1313
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
you find uh this sort of topic

1314
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,480
interesting and want to stay uh up to

1315
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,400
date on the latest and greatest types of

1316
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
attacks that we're seeing in the wild

1317
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,240
and with that i will open it up for any

1318
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
uh q a i will be in the the discord

1319
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,440
channel for the track so uh just let me

1320
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,040
know if you have any questions or

1321
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,640
anything like that thank you so much for

1322
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,240
the the time i really appreciated and

1323
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,640
hope it was helpful stay safe out there
