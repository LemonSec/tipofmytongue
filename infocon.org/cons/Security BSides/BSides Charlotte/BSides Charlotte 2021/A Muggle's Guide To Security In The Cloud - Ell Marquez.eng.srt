1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,639
hey everyone welcome to a muggles glass

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,880
a muggle's guide to security in the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,080
cloud now before i get started i do want

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560
to mention that muggle is never going to

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,800
be used as a negative term here because

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,439
to me it's interchangeable with newbie

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,199
just means that you have powers that

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,519
you've yet to discover i guess i should

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
go ahead and introduce myself my name is

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
elle marquez and i am the security and

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
linux advocate at inteser yeah what does

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,880
that mean it means that i get to work

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
with other wizards to like dissect

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,879
spells and figure out how they were put

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,840
together but this wasn't always the case

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,760
before this i was a linux system

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,239
administrator and this meant that i was

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,960
able to learn spells that helped me cast

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,039
spells around my environment my

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
customers environments and protect them

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
from any attacks that they were gonna

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,160
face and then i was able to progress my

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
craft to build the cloud itself and then

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
i learned how to actually break spells

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
apart and put them into these little you

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
know con hold on

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,799
yes you muggles call them containers

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
all right i'm being a dork and that is

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,600
what you should 100

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
expect from this presentation what you

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,439
need to know is my name is elle and i

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
am a wizard

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,080
and

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
this talk is going gonna be cheesy and i

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
mean over-the-top cheesy and you're

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,320
gonna groan and go like oh my god i

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,159
can't believe she just said that and

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,400
that is perfect because when we're

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
virtual you're gonna pay attention to

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
other things your kids are gonna walk in

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,439
trust me i've done recordings where my

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,119
kids just walk in and start talking to

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,119
me in the middle of it it's gonna happen

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,799
to you you're gonna hear it from the

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
side and you'll be like i'm sorry what

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
did she say and you're gonna tune in and

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,759
you're gonna remember it so when

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
somebody asks you a question you'll be

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
like oh let me tell you what happened

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and it's going to be great with that

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
said let's get into today's agenda now

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
today's agenda is really really simple

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,600
you know we're going to talk about our

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
spell books and we're going to delve

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
into the terminology in it i mean

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,598
mudbloods and wizards and death eaters

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,720
oh my

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
and from there we're going to talk about

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,040
hogwarts i mean this is the key

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,120
foundation to our world right so we're

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
going to delve in some polyjuice and

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
what are you all here for right you're

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
here to take defense against the dark

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
arts

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
all right maybe i've carried the analogy

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
too long because you probably have no

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
clue what we're going to talk about

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
today so what are we going to talk about

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
today terminology it's at the foundation

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
of any communication that we have in

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
this industry then we're going to talk

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
about cyber criminals like

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
i hate to say this but they're the only

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
reason we have a job if they didn't

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,360
exist what would we be doing

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
and we're going to have a serious

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
conversation about what it is that we

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
are most afraid of in cyber security and

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
that's the unknown

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
then a key factor that we don't ever

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
talk about in cyber security and i can

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
tell you i've been in the field for a

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
while and it's not until recently that

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
i've already heard it and that's the

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,640
concept of code reuse okay not going to

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
geek out now i'll wait till i get to

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,519
that part

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
and of course we're going to definitely

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,040
focus on defense now check that word out

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,159
for a minute and then check it

91
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
throughout my presentation a little

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,239
easter egg because i'm a dork all right

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
let's kick this off with spells and

94
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,959
terminology now if you all would please

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
take out your spell books this is really

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,760
where we need to kick off this class

97
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,159
one thing you need to know though is

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,799
terminology in cyber security is this

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
big alphabet game and

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
you know i don't take myself seriously

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
have you not like figured this out

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
throughout this entire presentation so

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,920
i'm gonna say things incorrectly i might

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,159
call things incorrectly i've had a long

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,799
day i'm gonna stumble over my words and

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
if that's what you're focused on then

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
you're missing the entire purpose of

108
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
this conversation because it's going to

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,840
happen whenever you're working with a

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,799
team

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,040
like one of the phrases and i promise

112
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,720
you it's not verbatim because i can't

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
remember but it was very similar to it

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,439
was a senior level tech trying to

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,000
impress us you know little muggles that

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
were there and saying our company's ec2

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,959
instances have been compromised due to

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,080
cve 2009 oh 21 or oh 21. go look it up

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
legitimately i remember that part

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,960
we can't uh you know and we can't afford

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
for these attackers to circumvent the

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
certificate chain via dsa and ecdsa keys

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
who's impressed by that you don't

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
impress me by your terminology you

125
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,199
really just kind of make me feel bad for

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
you that you feel you have to speak that

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
way and you're going to be in that

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
situation people are going to be able to

129
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
impress you with the spells that they

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
cast because they're wizards and you'd

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,080
never be able to understand you know

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
what you're muggle be proud of it

133
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
because you can actually say you know

134
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
what an attack happened on our amazon

135
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,160
cloud servers and it was successful so

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
we really should fix our authentication

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
that's it you spoke muggle language and

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
you got everything clear and

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,160
understandable all right i want you to

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
go ahead and pull out your first spell

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,199
book right this is your standard book of

142
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
spells grade

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
oh man i forgot completely to actually

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
tell the organizers that you are going

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
to need these spell books so we're going

146
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
to have to edit this talk and we're

147
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
going to just kind of come back to it um

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,759
you can attend my you know uh wizard

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,520
class for cloud security because we'll

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
delve into it but you'll be fine i'll

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
give the links to the organizers and you

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
can get them later all right the whole

153
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
concept of this book is all around

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
terminology i still use it like i

155
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,199
probably used it a few days ago because

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
sometimes you know a term but it's

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759
really hard to you know vocalize it to

158
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
be able to explain it to others and

159
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,639
maybe one of the reasons that i actually

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
you know and tell you about this book

161
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
maybe a little like lockhart here is if

162
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
you look really closely on the screen

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
you can see that i was involved in the

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
forward writing of this book

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
and that's because

166
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,319
the authors of this book really believed

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
in the campaign that i've started about

168
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
it's okay to be new just think of it as

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
it's okay to be a muggle

170
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
the next book is gonna be you're

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
dissecting the hack book and this is

172
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,880
what i call the storybook of spells it's

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,080
because it's an actual story written

174
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
about two guys who are out there you

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
know like really living the life that we

176
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,720
all want to in cyber security kind of

177
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
borderlining criminal but you know and

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
they fall into the world of death eaters

179
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
and as you're going through terminology

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
and as you're reaching spells you can go

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
to the back and you can get a true

182
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,919
explanation of how those spells actually

183
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,000
impacted the storyline

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
let's get into why you're actually here

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
in class today

186
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,240
and that's the attack

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
one key fact in every cyber attack is

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
that there has to be some form of wizard

189
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
maybe a very talented muggle who hasn't

190
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
discovered he's a wizard that is

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,319
involved behind it i don't care what the

192
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
threat is i don't care how it's been

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
automated

194
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
somebody wrote the code somebody

195
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
launched that attack for it to start in

196
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,560
in the security industry we really

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
always like to look at these attackers

198
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,599
as the death eaters right it's not just

199
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
some common wizard it is somebody who

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
has this scary power to be able to get

201
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
into our systems and cause this havoc i

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
mean

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
this

204
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
is the face of an attacker right

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
somebody's sitting there with their

206
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
hoodie up and the guy fox maxed up wow i

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
told you i wasn't gonna be able to talk

208
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
and they're in this dark room crafting

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
and writing their evil spells writing

210
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
their malware to compromise our

211
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,759
environment

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
it's going to be further from the truth

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
in fact most of the time

214
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,840
our attackers look like this

215
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
and you know honestly

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
in the regular world outside of the

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
wizard world outside of harry potter

218
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
there are no true blue of blue bloods

219
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,680
pure blood wizards it's all regular

220
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,240
humans who have learned a trait who have

221
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
spent the time to teach grains of salt

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,319
how to do so much more i mean after all

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
that's all computers started with

224
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
and

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,840
unfortunately they've decided that

226
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
they're going to use their powers from

227
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
malicious acts you know such as

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,919
targeting our system such as launching

229
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,159
their malicious spells their malicious

230
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,679
code and it's truly important for us not

231
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,080
to group all these attackers in the same

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
bucket because when we do we really

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,360
place our companies at

234
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
the forefront of actually being attacked

235
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,519
because we go into these crazy scenarios

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,600
of how we're going to attack i mean it's

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
going to be this advanced apt who's

238
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,959
going to be targeting our specific

239
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
systems trying to get you know through

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
all our walls of defense and they're

241
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
going to be targeting this specific

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,519
database because they're already going

243
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,640
to know and we build these scenarios in

244
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
our minds and then

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
some common kid you know i don't know 16

246
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
7 year old kid 17 year old kid maybe

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
seven playing around on his dad's

248
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
computer finds like a script that he's

249
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
like oh this is really cool i should try

250
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,519
this does a port scan uh you know on

251
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
showdown find something launches it

252
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,279
takes down your entire environment

253
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,320
if this seems like ual that would never

254
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,839
happen like you've gone too far in your

255
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,160
examples i'll put a link on it

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,240
lo punk.com

257
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,200
you know charlotte and

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
or you could just google it like i'm

259
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
sorry i'm getting really excited and

260
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
nerding out but i want you to google

261
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
mafia boy aka the boy who took down the

262
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
internet that's not an example that i

263
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
just gave you that's

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
a true story

265
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,519
so our attackers have to have something

266
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
that they're targeting right they have

267
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
to go and actually breach an environment

268
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
they have to have a goal because hey i

269
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,200
can do all the thinking about doing evil

270
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,279
things and writing all the spells

271
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,079
it doesn't accomplish anything until it

272
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,519
actually occurs

273
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,480
so

274
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
this is where we're going to talk about

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,760
hogwarts

276
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
and

277
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
when you read the books if you've

278
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
watched the movies you feel like you

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,200
really understand what that castle is

280
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,279
like i could draw it out for you i can

281
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,600
tell you what paintings were there i can

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
you know create the world for you

283
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
because i've read that book 15 times

284
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
but if you had you actually understand

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
that there's no way for all of us to

286
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,839
know that i mean that's highlighted over

287
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,079
and over in the book

288
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,480
that's true with all of our environments

289
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,399
you know we've got schematics and we've

290
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,839
got all this planning and we've got

291
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,320
policy books and procedure books and the

292
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
truth is that technology is changing so

293
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,920
quickly the cloud has brought the

294
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,240
ability for this agility we have you

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
know companies such as netflix and

296
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
capital one

297
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,959
spinning up containers every 10 seconds

298
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
every i mean like i've seen

299
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
talks and presentations where they're

300
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,959
talking about it happening like every

301
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,240
few seconds

302
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
tell me how you're going to see

303
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,839
visibility in that and it's not just

304
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
containers it's cloud servers it's using

305
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
things like lambda functions

306
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,160
it's impossible for us to know every

307
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
single thing that's occurring within our

308
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
aws cloud now let's add a hybrid cloud

309
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
we got azure we got jc gks we got google

310
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
cloud for our kubernetes instances and

311
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
we're at a disadvantage so what we fear

312
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
the most

313
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
is the unknown i've had conversations

314
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
with companies and i'm like okay

315
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
let's break this down we're going to go

316
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
from the bottom up

317
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,120
what are you trying to protect

318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,360
our environments

319
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
that doesn't tell me anything like the

320
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,160
analogy that i use i've used several

321
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,320
times my apologies if you've heard it is

322
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
the fact that that's like taking your

323
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
car in and you know it's making a noise

324
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
it's doing whatever and you know and the

325
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
mechanic asks you know hey what are we

326
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
working on today and you say ah the car

327
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
and walk off

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
it's possible for him to figure it out

329
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
and it's going to take a lot of work

330
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
and guess what while we're trying to

331
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
figure out what that environment is

332
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,399
while we're trying to figure out where

333
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
that data is it's going to shift 15

334
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,600
times

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,399
so the number one thing that you need to

336
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
know is

337
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
what are you trying to protect if it's

338
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,440
your data where is it located is it

339
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
multiple clouds is it in a database is

340
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
it you know well that's in the database

341
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
sorry where is that database located are

342
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,680
there databases out there that actually

343
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
aren't being reached by anyone so then

344
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
they just become a vulnerability

345
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
someplace for attackers to be able to

346
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
target because we don't know where it

347
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
really lays

348
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
my dear muggles this is where your power

349
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
is just going to explode because you're

350
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,160
high level wizards they're like oh we

351
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
know everything we have all these

352
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,639
schematics look i have this entire wall

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
of boards that i can see

354
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,720
all the spells being crafted where i

355
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,399
kind of want to go x-men here and so

356
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,320
like where all the mutants are but yeah

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna cross

358
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,279
streams because that has bad

359
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
consequences

360
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,279
we ask why as muggles we have questions

361
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,760
we say wait why did that happen how do i

362
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,560
know how do i handle this ticket like it

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
is those questions that are really going

364
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,240
to help companies be able to develop a

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
new strategy to protecting to the cloud

366
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,279
wizards are still just stuck in their

367
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
old ways you know as like infrastructure

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
on premise

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
my dear muggles this is your power and

370
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
it is stronger than you will actually

371
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,480
ever know

372
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
how do you actually implement how do you

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
use it the same way that harry potter

374
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,399
did what he needed was visibility so he

375
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,600
was lucky enough to be gifted with a

376
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
certain map you know

377
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
to me this was a very exciting part of

378
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,639
the book because we finally see you know

379
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
the story just to me expand much further

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,639
than you know harry within himself we

381
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,800
started seeing the interaction between

382
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
other characters and this storyline that

383
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
weren't specifically from his point of

384
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
view

385
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
but what happened when he got this map

386
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,199
specifically further in the books not

387
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,279
the original like go down pretend that

388
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
we're just like condensing them all

389
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,519
together

390
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,199
is he was able to see a character that

391
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
wasn't supposed to be there i mean

392
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,800
he was there obviously like the map was

393
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,160
saying but

394
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,720
harry had never seen him there'd been no

395
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
one that ever saw him so

396
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
what was going on

397
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
this is exactly where you need to have

398
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
your mindset because there's a muggle

399
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
i'm gonna be honest with you and

400
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
people say i shouldn't say this because

401
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,639
it's condescending or whatever but look

402
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
you're gonna be lost you're not gonna

403
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,279
know what's going on and that's okay

404
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,920
that's where your questions spur from

405
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
but

406
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,680
it's very intimidating because we see an

407
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,079
issue we look at the map we know it's

408
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,959
there

409
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,680
but we don't always understand like

410
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,320
that's fundamentally the cloud you're

411
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,360
not alone in that the cloud is changing

412
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,519
you have three months release cycles you

413
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
have all those deployments that i talked

414
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
about aws has something as of like 18

415
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
000 services available right now and by

416
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
the time you watch this video it might

417
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,959
have completely changed

418
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
you can't be scared of the unknown

419
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
because you're going to live in fear

420
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,959
your entire career and

421
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,040
i don't mean to like your mongrel i

422
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,199
don't mean to scare you i'm going to

423
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,399
present a very real picture to you of

424
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
what you're going to see but what i want

425
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,920
you to know

426
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,519
is

427
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,680
not being afraid accepting that that's

428
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
gonna happen

429
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,600
that's what you need to really level up

430
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
from going to a muggle

431
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
to a wizard and it's going to take some

432
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,000
time and that's okay

433
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
because it's taking time it means that

434
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,720
you're not taking shortcuts that you're

435
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,759
growing

436
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,480
with the cloud itself and that you are

437
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
willing to take the time to understand

438
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
i i've said it so many times but i need

439
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,839
you to listen

440
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,399
that is what sets you apart that is

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,160
where your power is and that really

442
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
became the reason that i decided to

443
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
write this talk you know muggle's guide

444
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
to cloud security because

445
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,199
it's not that difficult to understand

446
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,160
when you break it down to the basics and

447
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,959
that's exactly where you are right now

448
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,040
okay enough you know building you up

449
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
though i think it's important let's dig

450
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,040
into the next important part

451
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,680
and that's paulie juice now we all saw

452
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,160
polly juice as this very comical concept

453
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,919
right oh you know what there was a

454
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,000
little hair from the cat and turned into

455
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
a you know turned into a cat kind of

456
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,559
hybrid you know funny funny funny but

457
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,199
the fact is that this was the core of

458
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,000
the attack that happened and we don't

459
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
stop to actually make the connection at

460
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
how powerful this truly was it's not

461
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
just a comical stance i mean even when

462
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
they talk you know and they really go

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
into harry trying to mount his defenses

464
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
and get information like hey look

465
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,440
harry's dressed and hermione's clothes

466
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
oh ha ha he has this little tight dress

467
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,480
like

468
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,600
it

469
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,559
really

470
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,880
i don't brings down the power of this

471
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
attack and that's exactly

472
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
what we're doing when it comes to cyber

473
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
security i mean

474
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,160
let's stop take a breath and really

475
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
analyze this picture but do so through

476
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
the eyes of a security-minded muggle

477
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,799
she'll love how i just kind of keep

478
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,280
putting you in different places hey

479
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
welcome to the cloud welcome to security

480
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
your job's going to change 15 times and

481
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
you've got to change your outlook okay

482
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
so what happened was everybody took some

483
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,200
poly some poly juice and they started

484
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,440
bringing out the appearance of harry

485
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,400
potter

486
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,360
but they didn't get the mannerisms they

487
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,320
didn't get the personality they mutated

488
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
in a sense but they still regained who

489
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,320
they were and yes they completely tried

490
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,039
to match all the mannerisms and their

491
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,559
voices and it was funny but this is

492
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
actually a process that is happening

493
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
with attackers there's this concept

494
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,280
called polymorphic malware and it's

495
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
malware that's written in order to

496
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
continuously change it goes into a

497
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
system it kind of worms its way

498
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,440
throughout other systems you know

499
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,120
pivoting and as it does it's constantly

500
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,600
changing the code that it is it changes

501
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
part of its code which then bypasses our

502
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
signature based detection it changes the

503
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
way that it acts

504
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,039
bypassing our anomaly-based detection

505
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,160
this isn't a new concept polymorphic

506
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,559
malware has been around longer than i

507
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,400
have in this industry which might not

508
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
say much but you get the point you can

509
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,799
talk to any old neckbeard any longbeard

510
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,720
wizard and they'll be able to tell you a

511
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
story about polymorphic malware

512
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
the scary thing is that

513
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,080
it's still occurring today these type of

514
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
attacks are occurring every day and we

515
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,280
still

516
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,320
don't have the defenses that we need to

517
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,760
they stop to think about this decades of

518
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,880
a certain type of attack and it's still

519
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
functional today

520
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
where are we with our security posture

521
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
this is one of my favorite um kind of

522
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,640
malware families to speak about i always

523
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
feel weird saying that i have favorite

524
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
malware because it kind of makes me feel

525
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,960
that i'm saying it's okay for attacks to

526
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
happen i'm not but when you're going to

527
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,679
be especially in the dfir in the

528
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
research center

529
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
you have to enjoy what you're doing

530
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
because there's never a true answer it's

531
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,919
always another rabbit hole and another

532
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
rabbit hole and another piece of malware

533
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,559
that's changed

534
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
accept that own it love it and you are

535
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,640
going to excel in this industry but what

536
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
you're seeing here over on the left side

537
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,200
where it says family samples is

538
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
literally that different samples

539
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,200
different signatures of malware that

540
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
we've seen out in the wild and i'll

541
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
include a link on my website where you

542
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
can go through and reanalyze the code

543
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,400
and see

544
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,039
what else is appearing from there i mean

545
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,440
look at what you're seeing right here

546
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
when it comes to the first scene

547
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,720
how many of these strands occurred on

548
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
the 29th this is how quickly this

549
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,799
malware is actually changing and you can

550
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,280
see as far back as september 25th

551
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,520
september sorry 14th that you're seeing

552
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,240
it

553
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
now

554
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
one key piece that isn't discussed

555
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
that by listening to this talk you're

556
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
gonna have the heads up is that

557
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,080
you can't take ancient i'm gonna go with

558
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,039
ancient but whatever

559
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,039
standardized you know antivirus it

560
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,000
worked on our infrastructure and port it

561
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,360
over to the cloud because historically

562
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
you can see that it's failing and how

563
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,360
can i make these you know big

564
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,880
accusations and how can i say

565
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
historically it's right here on the

566
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
screen that you're looking at

567
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
move over to the last column over there

568
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,360
that says virus total this is how many

569
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,240
of the engines on virus total i

570
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,039
shouldn't laugh on virus total actually

571
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,559
detected this piece of malware okay so

572
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,240
starting from the very very bottom we

573
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
see 47 out of 69 detected okay and the

574
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,720
reason the numbers at the end change is

575
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
because sometimes some engines are

576
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
available when they're not

577
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,679
not the point you can just look at the

578
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,400
variables so okay you know what that

579
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
that's getting too close to half and we

580
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
did something

581
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,679
the very next string the very next piece

582
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,600
of the variant of that malware is now

583
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,760
getting 21 out of 60.

584
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,200
how are we going down in detection from

585
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
the time that we've first seen it and

586
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,440
you know what look right there like one

587
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,600
two three four up

588
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,880
zero detection zero this is known

589
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
malware we know it's happening we've

590
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
talked about polymorphic now we're like

591
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,960
none of this is a secret none of this

592
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
should even catch our wizards off guard

593
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
but it is it's right there i'm not

594
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
making this up you can go run the scan

595
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
yourself

596
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,600
the way that i relate this back to uh

597
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,080
harry potter and maybe you dear muggles

598
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
can actually explain this to our

599
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,840
wonderful wizards this way so that

600
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
they'll understand

601
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,400
is

602
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,039
when we're looking at our professor of

603
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
the dark arts

604
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,000
he

605
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,200
told everyone almost but follow me along

606
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
our analogies aren't perfect and two he

607
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
was just the sad little pathetic man who

608
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,720
we should probably feel bad because he

609
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
can't even really speak

610
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
but secretly he had powers within him

611
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,520
that

612
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,679
yo i was surprised when it happened i

613
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,039
don't know about you but it really

614
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,640
caught me off guard in that part of the

615
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
movie and that sample that i just showed

616
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
you and go back to the screen here of

617
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
ipstorm has an interesting background to

618
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,320
it you see ipstorm is actually malware

619
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,039
that was written for windows

620
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
how many of you would be sitting here

621
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,280
going hmm i should probably look for

622
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,360
that windows malware on my linux box

623
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,679
i promise you now hopefully people are

624
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,679
thinking that but about this time they

625
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
weren't however

626
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,679
everything is constantly changing and

627
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,919
we've seen the release of a whole new

628
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,440
spell language if you want to see it

629
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
we've seen golang really start to

630
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,120
prosper in the cloud environment it is

631
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,520
the language that all your cloud native

632
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
staff ooh fancy word right let's get our

633
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,840
spellbook out all it means is

634
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,520
applications and things that were

635
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,840
written specifically to work well in the

636
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,960
cloud like kubernetes like you can i'll

637
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
add links but they're not even there

638
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
i'll go add them because it is a very

639
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,039
important term that you need to

640
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,679
understand so you can uh impress those

641
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,200
wizards out there

642
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
the i.t storm was actually dubbed from

643
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,760
the interplanetary interplanetary storm

644
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,279
and it used peer-to-peer p2 networking

645
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,360
that that's what it's called impressive

646
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
right well

647
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
it didn't matter like that was

648
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,760
windows-based system and attackers went

649
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,080
okay we have something that's working

650
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
it's continuously working why are we

651
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,039
going to reinvent the wheel let's just

652
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,480
take that code

653
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,120
change it up a little bit and target

654
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,000
linux systems when in azure researchers

655
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,480
found it it actually had zero base

656
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
detection within it and it was running

657
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,400
on linux and mac os there is a whole new

658
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,559
field that we need to be aware of a

659
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,720
whole new crop of wizards

660
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
evil wizards death eaters but they're

661
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,039
wizards and they are completely owning

662
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,120
this field because they're thinking in

663
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,320
ways that our wizards right now are not

664
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
so let that be another lesson to you you

665
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
need to be more like the death eaters

666
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
maybe that's not the right way to say

667
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
this lesson but you need to have

668
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,200
creativity you don't need to reinvent

669
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
the wheel you just need to think outside

670
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,200
the box because the power that all of

671
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,840
these attackers have is the power to

672
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,120
fool us in who they are they don't look

673
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
as threatening we're looking for death

674
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
eaters but they're just this underground

675
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
group that we really don't know about

676
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,559
that much and

677
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,360
we really haven't placed that much um

678
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,480
priority a priority in catching them

679
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
i had a very

680
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,120
look what was scary situation occurred

681
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
the other day and i was talking to a

682
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
company and i'd kind of seen hints of

683
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
this before but this was the first time

684
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
that somebody just came out and told me

685
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,279
this they said you know what

686
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,200
when we have releases in the cloud it

687
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
needs to happen quickly it needs to be

688
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,039
out there as soon as possible because

689
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,360
we've made promises to our customers

690
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
that this function is going to come out

691
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,960
understandable right that's what a

692
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,240
company does

693
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,679
and they're talking about how their

694
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
deployment cycle comes and they said

695
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,640
eventually

696
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
we know that there are vulnerabilities

697
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,880
in the cloud we know that people know

698
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
about these vulnerabilities

699
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
but we have to get that function that

700
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,679
part of the product out so we sit down

701
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
and we look at it

702
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
what are the what are the benefits that

703
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
we're gonna have getting this out like

704
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,600
you know our customers are gonna be

705
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
excited we're the first to market we're

706
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,039
going to gain money people are going to

707
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,000
come

708
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
and what's the likelihood that we are

709
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,919
going to be attacked what's the

710
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,000
likelihood that that vulnerability can't

711
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,279
be fixed in time fix it in production

712
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,960
before we're attacked capability that

713
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,559
attackers aren't even gonna know it's

714
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
there so how much money do we stand to

715
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
make versus

716
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
all of that and how much money do we

717
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
stand to lose

718
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
how scary is that that that's your data

719
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,600
that's your money and this is the way

720
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,120
that they're playing they're choosing

721
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,080
not to see that side of the face they're

722
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
choosing only to focus on that innocent

723
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
quibbling can't even talk right

724
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,360
professor of the dark arts

725
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
now talking about professors of the dark

726
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
arts

727
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
have you ever stopped to think about how

728
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
many of them really weren't what they

729
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
thought they were like

730
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,720
shouldn't hogwarts have maybe had some

731
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,120
kind of bedding or something after the

732
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,960
first one got through

733
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,520
shouldn't we have some kind of vetting

734
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,399
or monitoring after the first time the

735
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,320
malware got through

736
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
this is probably one of the analogies

737
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,559
that isn't even a stretch

738
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
done a lot of talking this is

739
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,919
interesting and

740
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,360
one thing i should have mentioned i'm

741
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,679
completely gone is that the

742
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
dark arts teachers that we suspected the

743
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,720
most to be the evil ones to be the ones

744
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
that were crafting bad or crafting uh

745
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,799
malicious spells

746
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,240
are the ones that were actually trying

747
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,200
to help

748
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
like oh that was very comical to me

749
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,799
great writing but we can't take things

750
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,000
at face value when it comes to our

751
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
environments when it comes to the code

752
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,440
that we're running because something

753
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,600
might look like i really need to dig

754
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,159
into this and then we spend hours upon

755
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,320
hours and i can tell you really do

756
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,760
delving into this rabbit hole because

757
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,520
you know it's something

758
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,679
only to find out that it was just a blip

759
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,440
in the code the dev ran something and

760
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
forgot to tell us they updated their

761
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
code and oh yeah it used up more cpu

762
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
and

763
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,880
what happened during that time a crafty

764
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,760
attacker who you know seemed very

765
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
innocent was able to launch code in our

766
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,080
boxes that acted the way that we

767
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,279
expected it to and now our data's for

768
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,679
sale to the highest bidder

769
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,840
simple explanation you know i've gone

770
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
very high i've gone very low and if you

771
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
are a muggle who just has a day or two

772
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
even learning about the world of the

773
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
wizards it might be a little complicated

774
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,399
that's okay you'll get up to us and

775
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,240
you'll be a wizard probably long before

776
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,919
i am

777
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,520
here's our simplified explanation

778
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,799
hogwarts

779
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,159
and y'all are probably gonna be laughing

780
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,919
if i'm not saying that correctly after

781
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
this whole day you say it differently

782
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,480
but

783
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,799
you get the point anyways think of that

784
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,120
as our host machine that's our cloud

785
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
server and that's really where

786
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,399
everything happens and one of the clear

787
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
things that we need to see how i talked

788
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,120
about visibility is we don't know

789
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,279
everything that's there it's important

790
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,000
that we use tooling that helps us really

791
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,159
look into this now this tooling can be

792
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,320
completely different for each company

793
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
i'm not telling you what specifically to

794
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,520
use but i'm lazy and i know the tools

795
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,080
that i use are simple so that's what i'm

796
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
going to be showing you so take that and

797
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,799
do whatever it is that you want to

798
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,600
but by actually being able to see not

799
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,480
only what hosts that we have but what's

800
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
running on them like which one of these

801
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,720
are my kubernetes instances what nodes

802
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,279
work with them you know what

803
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,159
images are running on them you can get

804
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,919
visibility to actually be able to

805
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,159
monitor if the attacker is in your

806
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,279
system

807
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,120
this is key i don't remember i said this

808
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,720
in this talk before because i say it so

809
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,720
many times but behind every attack

810
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,279
there has to be malicious code run

811
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,520
you can have all of the back doors

812
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
available to your castle that you want

813
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,840
to and unless somebody walks through

814
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,880
them and does something it's not that

815
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,960
big of a deal right somebody walks into

816
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,320
the wall or sends the walls into the

817
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
doors and just kind of stands there

818
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
i mean it sucks that they're there but

819
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,080
they're not really doing anything it's

820
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
when they start monitoring when they

821
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
start launching and looking into your

822
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,760
environments and trying to do things

823
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,559
when that spell is cast that you really

824
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,240
can monitor them and that there's

825
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,200
actually an issue because it goes back

826
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
into you know we have the great hall and

827
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
we have hundreds if not thousands of

828
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
students and they're all supposed to be

829
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,559
there but could you go down that list

830
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,399
and name each one of them to me and tell

831
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,840
them what they were doing and what you

832
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,640
know what house they were a part of like

833
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,320
i know like three of these characters

834
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,679
all of them were other extras that

835
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,320
weren't even given speaking lines but at

836
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,279
the same time how many evil wizards how

837
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,440
many defense against the dark arts

838
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
people were allowed to be there i mean

839
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
to a certain degree

840
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
when did malfoy become evil we see it

841
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,240
happen we know it's happened but do you

842
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
know the exact moment that it occurred

843
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,799
that's what you need visibility to

844
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,440
good code could be turned into malicious

845
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,279
um i didn't put it in the slide but hey

846
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,799
i just go off the cup

847
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,159
there is a piece of malware that was

848
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,440
found called docking docky is

849
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,600
probably my second favorite example to

850
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,279
use so if you hear a bunch of my talks

851
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,480
you're going to hear it but it's

852
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,360
fascinating to me because docky

853
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,000
isn't malicious there's absolutely no

854
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,080
malicious code to it his malfoy's you

855
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,679
know what he's probably rude you know

856
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,000
some of our images like don't work well

857
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,760
on containers and we hate it as security

858
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,679
folks because it brings up alerts but

859
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,240
nothing was ever happening so docky is

860
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,279
just a piece of code ran up as an image

861
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,440
but within seconds it turned malicious

862
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,279
because it was able to use the curl

863
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,679
command and as a former sysadmin i can

864
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,919
tell you we use that a lot it is a great

865
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,159
troubleshooting uh tool

866
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,600
it pulled down malicious code it ran it

867
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,640
and like that it was gone now our host

868
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,399
has been compromised there's perhaps you

869
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,960
know uh the one that uh we discovered

870
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,039
once again zero based detection was

871
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,640
running a crypto miner like all of this

872
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
without really anything alerting to you

873
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
and alerting you to what it occurred

874
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,640
it's not like i said before shouldn't

875
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,799
there been some like vetting process on

876
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,960
who was going to take that position if

877
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
it kept being taken by people who are

878
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,279
trying to kill harry

879
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,799
just saying

880
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,480
which brings me to

881
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,399
mad-eye movie

882
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,559
uh like i am i the only person that is

883
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,399
i'm reading it going there's something

884
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,399
not right with this guy

885
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,720
but he's trusted he's written all these

886
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,840
books people can verify who he is like

887
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
we back this teacher he's going to be

888
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
great and you're going to learn a lot

889
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
about it that's what you're seeing in

890
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,279
polymorphic malware like this is one of

891
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
the examples that i like to use because

892
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
this goes completely to polyjuice you

893
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,799
have code which part of it looks like

894
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,640
it's trusted right i mean we've got

895
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
normal libraries that we'd expect to see

896
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
on our system but all of a sudden we

897
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,000
start seeing pieces of code that really

898
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,159
should kind of go like hey i've got

899
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,240
something on my system and it's running

900
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,120
like malicious libraries like why didn't

901
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,600
that trigger us into investigating it

902
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
hey this shares a lot of code with known

903
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,280
malware called xm rig miner

904
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,560
why didn't that trigger us to

905
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,440
investigate it i can go all the way up

906
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,199
this goes back into the fact that our

907
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,599
traditional defenses that which our

908
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,239
wizards are used to using

909
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,399
aren't enough and you

910
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,839
this is where you're going to shine

911
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,839
you're going to bring in new ideas new

912
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,719
ways of making new questions to ask and

913
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,800
that's what's going to help all of our

914
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,560
defenses get stronger because you're

915
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
going to be able to say you know what we

916
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,040
need to know what's running in our boxes

917
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,800
and i'm going to like tell you people

918
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,639
are going to look at you know what like

919
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,800
it's not a conversation that we have

920
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,879
anymore because after all we have cloud

921
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,119
security products you know we have

922
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,119
dementors flying around the castle

923
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,560
helping protect because we know an

924
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
attack is coming like at some point you

925
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,000
have to own your own defenses and know

926
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
what's going on

927
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
and that's where our security team comes

928
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,640
in

929
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,480
we're trying our hardest and you keep

930
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
hearing all these statistics about how

931
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,040
you know we don't have enough people in

932
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,920
cyber security and others have said it

933
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
but really my belief is that we don't

934
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,839
have enough people with the curiosity to

935
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,760
really kind of stand up to the wizards

936
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
to be in that interview and just own how

937
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,200
sometimes your lack of knowledge is the

938
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,720
best thing that's going to bring you

939
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,760
your strengths it okay i that's a whole

940
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,920
another talk so i'm just completely

941
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,720
gonna stop here and say that your assets

942
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
and your most valuable possession as

943
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,200
part of the security team is going to be

944
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,760
having visibility into everything if

945
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
you're the guy that can go in or girl

946
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,000
not bad go in and look and say you know

947
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
what here are our hosts we've got clean

948
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,760
code we're good we can focus on the

949
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
network

950
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,040
awesome if there is an attack happening

951
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
and people are delving into the network

952
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,839
and they're digging through and what

953
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,680
firewalls and you can pull up your tool

954
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,440
and be like that's great guess what

955
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
they're already in the host they're

956
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,440
running commands our data is gone

957
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,880
wow like i'm

958
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
okay i'm geeking out now like

959
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,960
you don't understand how different that

960
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
is from the current status quo

961
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,560
okay

962
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,680
here i am

963
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,040
last one i swear is that a lot of times

964
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
in the security industry we believe that

965
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,680
because we get code because we get

966
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
applications from a trusted source that

967
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,040
we're fine you pulled up your image from

968
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,680
you know aws you're running ubuntu

969
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,599
directly you went to the site and you

970
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,400
launched it you're running your

971
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,960
node.js application specifically from

972
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
the repository

973
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
go google no js compromise

974
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
that's it just go google it i will let

975
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,599
you make that discovery completely on

976
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,839
your own did you know that the linux

977
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,000
kernel was compromised attackers got

978
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,160
into it and to this day they can't tell

979
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,320
you how long it happened or what it was

980
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,359
there estimates about six months but

981
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,839
they're not sure there have been so many

982
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,240
repositories now uh i'll post links just

983
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,280
to make sure i get these right but i

984
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,880
believe it's the apache repository

985
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
that's been owned three times

986
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,280
they know what happened they have an

987
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
estimate of what occurred

988
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,599
but you're following that trusted source

989
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,240
and running the code on your system and

990
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
sometimes even as you're running the

991
