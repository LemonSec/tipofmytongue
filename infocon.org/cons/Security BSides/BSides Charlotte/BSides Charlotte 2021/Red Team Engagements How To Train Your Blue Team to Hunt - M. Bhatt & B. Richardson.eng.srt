00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,480
this is red team engagements how to

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,000
train your blue team to hunt adversaries

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
for this talk we're going to be sharing

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,280
some processes that will help mature

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,480
and rigor

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
add rigor to both your red and blue

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,520
teams

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
and especially equip your blue team to

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,760
build better detections

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
and effectively hunt adversaries

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,679
so first things first just a little

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,199
disclaimer here

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,680
the opinions beliefs and views expressed

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,559
by the authors that's us

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,559
of this presentation do not necessarily

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,640
reflect the opinions with some

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,680
viewpoints of our employer

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,600
and with that out of the way

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
little introductions

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,559
um

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,120
so i am bradfordson i'm an offensive

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,039

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,160
karma

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,239
you see there on the left i tweet at

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
and you'll also see

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,959
i like to write the occasional blog post

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,439
and the occasional tool so

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
you can find my articles on medium and a

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,760
recent tool of mine is called slackhound

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,720
it is a reconnaissance tool for

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,799
slack workspaces

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,600
so check that out

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
and now i'm going to

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,720
uh

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
let one of my best buds and colleague

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
introduce himself and walk you through

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
the next few slides motto take it away

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,720
thank you bro really appreciate it uh

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,400
good afternoon good morning good evening

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
wherever you are watching this from uh

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,280
i'm

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
 and offensive security

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
engineer great karma on the left side

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,439
what you see is my twitter handle uh

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,600
occasionally blog on medium

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
i sometimes write new tools uh you can

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,119
find

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,759
those tools either on github or on my

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,079
docker hub

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
desi jarvis repo

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
and from time to time you know

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,079
so

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,399
what i want to say is atomic red team if

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,040
you're not familiar with it

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
i have been using it for last you know

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,319
three or four years i'm a huge fan and

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,040
recently i have had the pleasure to

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,920
contribute to atomic red team uh we'll

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
talk about it in the next slide about

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
dynamic rectangle

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
in a little detail but if you're not

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
familiar with it i'd highly recommend

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
you check it out

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
so let's start this presentation with a

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
fun brain teaser text morgan

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,080
is he an apt or does he work in ir ah

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
since i can't see the audience i can't

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
have you guys how you guys face the

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
hands so i'll give you my perspective

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
uh the way i see it is texture loves to

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
do red teaming in his free time but he

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
gets it gets his w2 for working in ir

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,959
so if you are familiar with the tv show

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,560
you would see that actually walks up to

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,920
a crime scene he looks at the blood

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,280
spider pattern

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
you know deduce how the crime was

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,560
committed and uses the clues around the

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
crime scene to ultimately write down the

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
attacker

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
so

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
in one word dexter morgan is an apt who

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
works in ir

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
and that you know his passion about red

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,239
teaming is what makes him really good at

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,840
blue

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
and that is what we want from our blue

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,799
team uh our vision is to arm the

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,400
defenders of the network with the

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
capability that they can take an

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
isolated alert

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
investigate that alert to identify the

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,519
chain of events as they may have

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
happened and ultimately track and flush

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
the attacker out of the network

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,519
so if you want to use an example for it

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
for example say the blue team receives a

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
high fatality pass the has detection

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
the one time to be able to identify

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
whether that

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
pass the host that attempt to pass the

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,519
hash was initial point of compromise

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,959
if it was not an initial point of

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,239
compromise

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
how did the attacker literally move to

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
that host

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
and ultimately find the initial point of

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
compromise subsequent compromises and

111
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
flush the attacker out of the network

112
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
obviously it's easier said than done

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
uh it is difficult but definitely not

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
impossible

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,879
so how do we achieve this vision well

116
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,639
i'll use a little bit of soccer analogy

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
so if you want to play a 90 minute of

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,918
soccer game

119
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
uh you have to the basic requirements

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
are you have to be match fit and you

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
have to practice the basic skills like

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,560
dribbling passing shooting and tackling

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,479
and then you know your coach will

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
eventually make you play friendly camps

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
in the training sessions so you can

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
prepare for the actual match next day

127
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
and that is how we have broken down our

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
maturity process

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
so the four phases detection chart

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
purple team exercise adversary detection

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,639
pipeline and adversarial services life

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,759
cycle

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,240
the first two phrases are supposed to

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,199
you know

135
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,280
make you match fit and

136
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
help you practice the basic skills

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
and the adversarial services life cycle

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
is that friendly match between red and

139
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
blue that is supposed to prepare blue

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,520
for the actual match against actual

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
hackers

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
so without further ado let's jump into

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
phase one

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
detection chart

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
uh

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
this is what it looks like it looks like

147
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
four different paint buckets my uh

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
exploded on my attack framework

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,280
obviously there is a method to the

150
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,400
magnets so what does detection chart

151
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
well detection chart shows you you know

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
how good or bad you are at detecting

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
ttps on the scale of 0 to 3. so if we

154
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
take an example of bits at 90 db which

155
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
is t1197 if you don't detect that tdp at

156
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,199
all in your environment

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,720
then you give it a score of zero color

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
red if you do detect that tdp but not

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
its variation cir tutorial is one of the

160
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,479
variations

161
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,520
if you put carrots between b i d s it is

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
possible your adr tool or your av can

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
miss it

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
uh there is also one of the variation

165
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
so if you don't detect the variation but

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
the ttp itself that's the score of one

167
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
and color orange

168
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
if you do detect the tdp and it's known

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,039
variations

170
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
well that's a score of two color green

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
and obviously not all uh techniques that

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
the attacker use are going to be

173
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,000
applicable to your environment so that's

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
a score of three color gray you can

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,560
ignore building detection for that

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
now normally at this point i tell you

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
that you have to know your environment

178
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
and combine it with your experience as a

179
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
retimer to prioritize the dtps you want

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,199
to test for because you can't do this

181
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
for every single ttp there are hundreds

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
of tdps in minor attack framework

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
so uh there you know if you go to uh red

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,479
canary get up repo they have this tool

185
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,560
called gamify attack

186
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
uh it's a great tool that you can use

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,199
that you know you what you will do is

188
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,080
you'll

189
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
send a survey to your team bits and then

190
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,160
combine the answer of the survey to

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
prioritize the list of tpps

192
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,199
so check it out if you have time uh

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
you can use that to prioritize the list

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,880
of ttps you want to pull detection for

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
or test for

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
once you have a prioritized list of

197
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
techniques that attackers use

198
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,479
building detection chart is very

199
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,160
straightforward you're going to need

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
following things first you're going to

201
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
need a windows vm or linux vm with cold

202
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
image

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
and if you can have a mac with mac vm

204
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,160
with the gold image that's great

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,759
normally that doesn't work you probably

206
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
need a macbook for that so normally

207
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
you'll end up with a windows vm linux vm

208
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
and a macbook with a cold image

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,720
uh once you get this machines set up

210
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,280
you will pick a dtp from the prioritized

211
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,199
prioritized list of gtps

212
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,360
go and gather unit tests for it this is

213
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
where atomic red team comes in

214
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
uh you know automatic reaction has some

215
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,199
great tests that

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,639
you can quickly

217
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,720
you know test for and see if the

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
detections work but you also want to add

219
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
your own test you don't want to just

220
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
rely on commodity test so you'll gather

221
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
unit tests for those

222
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,639
that that ttp that you just picked

223
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,160
and then you run the ctps on the cold

224
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
image

225
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
if an alert is triggered

226
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,879
uh you know you rate between uh

227
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,160
you validate whether the alert is

228
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
triggered or not and based on that you

229
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
rate it between zero to two now one

230
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
thing uh i wanna make very clear during

231
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
this presentation is

232
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,599
if you

233
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,319
when we say the alert is triggered we or

234
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
when we say detection we mean an alert

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,479
is trigger so you can use alert and

236
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
detection interchangeably if you see the

237
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
activity in the log but alert is not

238
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
triggered we do not consider it a

239
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
detection for the purpose of this

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
presentation so just a mental not you

241
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,559
can swap alert and detection uh whenever

242
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,760
we'll be using it interchangeably

243
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
once you go through this for

244
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,120
http in your list you that will build

245
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
the foundation for your purple team

246
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,600
exercise

247
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
all right before we go into the next

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
phase

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
uh i want to talk about a tool that i

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,279
wrote detection navigator you can find

251
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,440
it on my head up pretty well

252
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,680
i used to maintain detection chart in a

253
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
spreadsheet

254
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
however

255
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
that's very cumbersome and you know if

256
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
the new dtps come out mitre changes the

257
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,880
way

258
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
they want to classify those stacking the

259
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
techniques

260
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,040
uh it's a big hassle so i don't django

261
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
this web server that

262
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
you know can make this a little more

263
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,519
seamless

264
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,320
uh and you know help you preserve your

265
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
scoring

266
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
so uh feel free to check it out uh on my

267
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
github repo i also have a blog post

268
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
about it in the readme file on how to

269
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
use it and as a bonus i've included

270
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
atomic tests for linux and mac os

271
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
these are the automation script that you

272
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
can refer to

273
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
and you can also add your own test to

274
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,880
this automation script and run them

275
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
so at the end of this phase you would

276
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
have achieved following

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
one you would have have a prioritized

278
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
list of ttps

279
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
uh you would provide transparency to

280
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,680
your leadership on how good or bad you

281
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,040
are at detecting these techniques

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
and you would have performed the gap

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
analysis that will help you you know

284
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
direct your resources

285
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,079
in a certain you know for for certain

286
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,480
detections uh response

287
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
visibility monitoring

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
and there is a bonus

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
if you do this you can use this same

290
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,839
method to evaluate edr tools in-house

291
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,600
minded does it you know renders a bit

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
their tools it might are for adr

293
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
evaluation

294
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
uh but if you do come rocker come across

295
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
an edr tool for poc that is not

296
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
evaluated by miter you can use the same

297
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
methodology

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
uh also you know maybe

299
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
uh you want to do you you still want to

300
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
do an edr evaluation despite my test

301
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
scoring because maybe the environment

302
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,959
you're using is a different than the ttp

303
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
is micro tested for you can definitely

304
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,839
use this method

305
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,320
phase two purple team exercise

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,680
now

307
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
we will not do a deep dive here uh

308
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
because there are some great

309
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
presentations out there uh on how to do

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
verbal team exercise for the purpose of

311
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
this presentation we would rather walk

312
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
you through what it would look like if

313
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
you do purple thing exercise

314
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
but if you do want to do a deep dive um

315
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
check out this presentation from cedric

316
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
owens uh you know

317
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
he speaks about how to do purple theming

318
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,440
in non-active directory environment but

319
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
you can translate it if you do have

320
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
active directory

321
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,320
of the methodology talks about will

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,399
overlap

323
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
so this is what the flow looks like for

324
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
purple team exercise

325
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,519
you pick a ttp you want to build

326
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,600
detection for and obviously you already

327
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,040
have detection chart at this point you

328
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
know which gtpg detect which you don't

329
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,279
so you'll pick the tdp you wanna build

330
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,800
detection four

331
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
you did run the unit test in the last

332
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
phase

333
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
so you would sort of have an idea of

334
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,240
what kind of indicators are generated

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
they can be network level indicators

336
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
host level or application level

337
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
based on what level of indicators are

338
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
generated you'll be working with network

339
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,880
engineer

340
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,959
a system administrator or an application

341
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,000
owner to have those indicators a lot to

342
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,360
sim

343
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
once they are locked the same you'll

344
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
work with the same expert to build a sim

345
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,839
query

346
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,519
then you'll test and review that sim

347
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
query and we'll talk in detail about how

348
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
to test and review it in the next phases

349
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,079
but for the purpose of this case let's

350
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,000
just say that it meets your criteria for

351
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,839
testing and reviewing

352
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
then you can deploy the query and you

353
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
just build a detection using purple

354
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,480
exercise

355
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
so let's make this more digestible using

356
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
an example and there is no better

357
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,160
example to use than dc sync because it

358
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,839
is an absolute worst nightmare for any

359
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,639
company absolute most favorite attack

360
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,040
for any red team on out there

361
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,279
for those of you who have done dc sync

362
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,079
on

363
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,279
for on-prem or domain controller

364
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
you would know that it generates ioc at

365
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
host level and network level

366
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
so if we go back a little we picked a

367
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
ttp

368
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
on the left side

369
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,880
that is dc sync and we identified the

370
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,240
ioc as network and host level iocs so

371
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
we'll work with network engineer and you

372
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
know domain admin to have those ios is

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
locked to sim then we'll build the sim

374
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
query to look for those indicators that

375
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
are not coming from domain controller

376
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
because obviously domain controller

377
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,880
legitimately do dc syncs and we'll test

378
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,519
and review the query deployed if it

379
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
meets our standard

380
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
right

381
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
now obviously it is not as easy as i'm

382
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,800
making it sound you will run into

383
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,639
challenges and i'll talk about one

384
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,720
challenge in each section but depending

385
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
on your environment

386
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
you'll have different challenges so for

387
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,680
example for network level detection to

388
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
work you have to make sure that paths to

389
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
your dc are all traffic to your domain

390
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,760
controller it goes through the ids that

391
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
will be sending you that log could be

392
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,839
other network device but for example

393
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,680
let's just say that it's the ids that is

394
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
going to send you those packets of dc

395
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,880
sync

396
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,680
and at the host level uh every time your

397
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,079
system administrator team add a new dc

398
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,600
you want to make sure that you update

399
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,839
that same query to exclude the new dc

400
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,199
otherwise your blue team is going to be

401
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,279
flooded with false positives so you'll

402
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,399
probably have to put a process in place

403
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,480
that you know whenever new dc is added

404
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
your system administrators notify your

405
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,240
detection engineers blue team stock ir

406
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
so depending on your environment again

407
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,279
different challenges and each ttp would

408
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,959
have its own challenges

409
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
maybe for visibility maybe for detection

410
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
maybe for response and that is why

411
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
building detections is very difficult

412
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
but if you do it right it can give you a

413
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,680
lot of mileage against red actors

414
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,120
so at the end of this phase you're the

415
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,959
chief following you would have improved

416
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,639
detection capabilities

417
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
this is a recurring process to audit

418
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,079
detection and

419
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,680
all the process all the phases we'll

420
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
talk about are recurring phases you'll

421
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,079
just be visiting at a different point in

422
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,959
time

423
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
depending on where you're at

424
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,360
uh this also focuses your forces your

425
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
red team to improve so your red team may

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
not be able to use commodity ttps

427
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,120
anymore they'll have to come up with

428
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
their own

429
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,199
and as a bonus this

430
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
exercise will provide insight into your

431
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
tools so for example

432
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
say your ids which is sending the lots

433
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,839
for deceasing cannot view those packets

434
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
that's a limitation

435
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,519
it means you are blind in that section

436
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,680
so next time you want to bind

437
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
next time you want to find

438
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
a new ids you want to upload it you want

439
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,240
to put in a questionnaire for the binder

440
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,760
uh that hey does your ideas allow this

441
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,079
uh before buying the two so just a bonus

442
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
you know it gives you how valuable the

443
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,720
tools you bought are

444
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
phase three adversary detection pipeline

445
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,839
this phase can go parallel to purple

446
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,440
team exercise however the main

447
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
difference is the involvement of red

448
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,160
team

449
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,519
red team would be heavily involved in

450
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,360
purple team exercise unless of course

451
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,759
you have dedicated perfecting engineers

452
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,000
uh then it's a different case

453
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
but uh if your red team wears multiple

454
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,759
hat then

455
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,440
purple theme exercise red team is

456
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
involved uh adversary detection pipeline

457
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
red team would be involved only in the

458
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
review process not as heavily involved

459
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,279
as the purple theme exercise

460
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
so this is what the workflow looks like

461
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,440
we already built the detection chart uh

462
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,279
very important foundation for all these

463
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,120
phases

464
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
the tdps you want to build a detection

465
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,959
for goes in the backlog then your

466
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
detection engineer or a blue team member

467
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,639
will

468
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
be assigned a ticket or they can pick a

469
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,320
ticket they want to work on it'll move

470
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,240
to in progress

471
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
then they'll identify what iocs are

472
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,480
generated for that tdp

473
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
and then they'll come up with the same

474
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,759
query to

475
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,839
find those iocs

476
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,519
and once they feel confident they'll go

477
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,959
to a review board to you know

478
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,639
make sure make sure everything is

479
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
ordered before the detection is deployed

480
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,880
and this is the review section we're

481
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
talking about from you know phase two

482
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,920
diagram

483
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
uh we'll in the next slide we'll have we

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
have questions on what those review

485
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,759
questions can look like

486
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,399
but say if the review board accepts your

487
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
content or detection of the sim query

488
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,279
detection engineer's job is done it will

489
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
be deployed to sim

490
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,079
uh and you know you just went through

491
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,599
adversary direction pipeline to build

492
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,359
their detection but

493
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,359
if review word finds something is

494
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,480
lacking

495
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
then

496
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,039
they will you know give you the feedback

497
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,400
you'll have to go back work on the

498
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,039
feedback and come back to tribute

499
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
so again no better way to explain this

500
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,199
than to use example and here let's use a

501
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,799
little bit different example this time

502
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,640
let's try to detect that ssh password

503
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
square

504
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,120
so first that gtp will go in the backlog

505
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,480
now say you've got sherlock holmeson

506
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,919
including

507
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,120
obviously the best person to have on

508
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,559
your blue team because he's the best

509
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
investigator of all time

510
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,039
sherlock has signed this ticket

511
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
sherlock looks at this uh you know dtp

512
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
and he's like yeah this is easy you know

513
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
generates a negative level i see

514
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
generates a lot of host level ilc

515
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
and it sherlock comes up with this query

516
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
you see on the right top side for

517
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
network law multiple ssh connection

518
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
different destination hosts same source

519
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
ip for host level multiple ssh file

520
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,440
logins different user name name source

521
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,039
ip

522
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,039
sherlock builds a sim query that

523
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,200
represents those two logics and goes to

524
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
the review board

525
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
now these are the questions

526
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,039
these are the questions that sherlock

527
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,120
should have answers for

528
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,640
when sherlock goes to the review

529
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
committee one is there a run book for

530
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
this alert meaning what step needs to be

531
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
followed to investigate

532
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
especially helpful for junior analyst

533
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
what is the proposed maturity of the

534
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
detection experimental or stable if it

535
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,039
is experimental sherlock with sherlock

536
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,039
will work those alerts until it becomes

537
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,240
stable

538
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
uh the next questions are related to not

539
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
wasting blue team stack how often will

540
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,880
it fire what is the false positive rate

541
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,960
and the last two question is where red

542
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
team can chime in

543
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
is there an alternate scenario that can

544
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,919
trigger this alert

545
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,520
and is there a way this logic can be

546
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
bypassed so as for the alternate

547
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,559
scenario if you look at the network

548
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,679
level logic

549
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,840
a simple nmap scan for port 22 will

550
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
trigger that alert

551
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
and when it comes to response context is

552
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,720
everything uh for a response to end web

553
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,679
scan

554
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
uh versus response to password spray for

555
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,400
password 3 you want to start looking for

556
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
successful logins maybe not for an

557
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
investment so it's something important

558
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
to remember context is crucial to

559
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
response

560
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
and for the logic bypass you'll not

561
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
always find a silver bullet for each and

562
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
every single one of those tdps you

563
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,200
should do great but if you don't

564
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
then you want to be aware of them so you

565
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
can put some mitigating controls in

566
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,640
place

567
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
now if the review committee finds all

568
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
the answers to these questions

569
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,520
satisfying

570
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
you know they'll hand this

571
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
query over to the sim expert obviously

572
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
you're not limited to these questions

573
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
you can add your own questions to this

574
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
these are just sample questions that you

575
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,760
can have in your in your review process

576
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
and once the same sme deploys the

577
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,640
content the sprint is complete

578
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,559
so at the end of this phase

579
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
you would achieve agile content creation

580
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
i know i'm just throwing out big words

581
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,120
out there but it is indeed agile uh it

582
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,720
will help you stay current with the

583
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
threats

584
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
uh this makes your blue team

585
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
self-sufficient obviously when your

586
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
rating resources are limited you don't

587
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
want to be relying on red team to build

588
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
detection using purple team

589
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,200
because otherwise they'll become the

590
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
bottleneck for you

591
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
and the most important part is

592
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,919
documented trail and ticket uh you know

593
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,200
enterprise ticketing software like

594
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
servicenow and jira right

595
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
uh if the person who wrote the detection

596
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
left the company you have something to

597
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,280
go back to and refer to on how the

598
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
detection was written or you want to

599
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
modify the detection maybe you want to

600
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
audit those detection all those things

601
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,240
documented drill helps you with that

602
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
so you know now we've you know done the

603
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
basic training on how to shoot past

604
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,360
tackle drivel and we have become

605
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,640
matchfit

606
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
i'll head over to brad to talk about the

607
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,159
friendly match written right into it

608
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
thanks manu

609
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,159
so what you see here

610
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,000
is the adversarial services life cycle

611
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
this is uh how we envision it so what

612
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,480
you see is

613
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
uh the life cycle end to end

614
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,520
if you look to the left we start with

615
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,679
our planning phase and we finish

616
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,520
ultimately on the right side by

617
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
validating that we have both robust

618
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,960
detection and a strong response

619
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,360
we'll talk more about each of these in

620
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,559
later slides but for now keep in mind

621
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,799
that the red team performs the exercise

622
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,840
planning

623
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,400
helps train the blue team test the

624
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
detection and response controls during

625
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
the execution phase which we'll talk

626
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
about

627
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,760
uh helps with the aars aars is

628
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,799
a military term you can kind of think of

629
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,000
it if you're not familiar with this

630
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
concept as

631
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
somewhat of an improvement plan

632
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
and we'll show some examples of what

633
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
that will look like

634
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
and as well we really believe that the

635
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,320
red team has the opportunity during the

636
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
adversarial services life cycle

637
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,280
to improve the overall security posture

638
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,080
by driving remediation for all the great

639
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
assessment findings that are going to

640
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,760
come out of your exercises especially

641
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,840
during the execution step

642
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,240
so let's talk a little bit about our

643
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,760
prerequisites and our planning phase

644
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
to us a successful planning phase will

645
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
really ensure a good red team exercise

646
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
it'll ensure your leadership sees a

647
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,799
security value

648
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,120
uh with all the things that the team is

649
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
doing both red and blue

650
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
and it'll keep the red team ultimately

651
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
out of legal trouble we'll talk a little

652
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
bit about what i mean by that

653
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,559
uh on the left side of the slide

654
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,240
you see things that we think are

655
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,280
critical in uh this phase

656
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,000
and on the right side you see examples

657
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,559
so let's jump into what those look like

658
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,280
so again to the left side you see

659
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
during this phase you want to define

660
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,840
your objectives definitely getting

661
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,559
buy-in and support understanding what's

662
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,000
important to your executives and

663
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,039
leadership is important when you go to

664
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
say write your rules of engagement

665
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,039
document

666
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
and you'll be doing that right

667
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,480
we'll talk a little bit about the

668
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,320
sections that you for sure want to have

669
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,559
in your rules of engagement

670
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,880
ultimately your rules of engagement

671
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,559
you're going to

672
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
run that by your legal team

673
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,159
ensure they understand what you'll be

674
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
doing they're going to help keep you out

675
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
of trouble right when you begin your

676
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
exercise you're going to be able to

677
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
focus on the exercise without really

678
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,760
concerns of uh you know are you breaking

679
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,320
uh some kind of legal

680
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,039
issue hopefully not the law

681
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,279
but your legal team will help guide you

682
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,039
in all of that and really important to

683
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
be on the same page with them before you

684
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
begin your exercise you're going to

685
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
establish your timeline

686
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
for emulating the different phases of

687
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
attack or whatever it is that you're

688
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
doing during your simulation

689
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,640
or your emulation

690
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
establishing your timeline is going to

691
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
help you stay on track

692
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
some people and teens will refer to as

693
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,240
uh the concept of time boxing uh your

694
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
engagement

695
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,400
this you know is a fancy term uh but it

696
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,279
helps

697
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,640
keep you moving through consistently

698
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,880
on track and the phases that you want to

699
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,200
target the things that you want to find

700
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,279
during your engagement during your

701
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,360
exercise the things that are important

702
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
to you

703
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
so timeline we'll talk about but that's

704
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,159
very important

705
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,320
if you have the opportunity to establish

706
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,679
a white cell

707
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,960
this is a person or sub team that

708
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
mediates between red and blue they're

709
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
really a facilitator we'll talk a little

710
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
bit more about that as well

711
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,279
as well as a green cell so if you have

712
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
the luxury of

713
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,159
a dedicated green cell team or person

714
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,080
they will help you manage your red team

715
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
infrastructure uh in any other

716
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
infrastructure that might be pertinent

717
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,039
to

718
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,840
your exercise

719
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,880
and then

720
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
to us in our opinion we believe that

721
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,080
it's important that if you're going to

722
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
be deploying any special infrastructure

723
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,679
like c2

724
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,520
to do it in this phase and the reason

725
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
being

726
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,799
once you get into your execution

727
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,320
or um

728
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,960
down the road somewhere in your exercise

729
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,799
there'll be a trade-off if you need to

730
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,760
go back and redeploy or to deploy

731
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,559
uh

732
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,480
again even managing infrastructure

733
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
there's a trade-off so if you're

734
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,919
especially if you're managing your own

735
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,799
infrastructure as a red team

736
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,720
go ahead and do it in this phase it will

737
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
save you time and energy when the clock

738
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,159
really starts during your execution of

739
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,679
the engagement

740
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
so looking at the examples just a little

741
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
bit about what all those things mean so

742
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,159
your objectives defined by your

743
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
executives or leadership team uh

744
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
could be that you are going to start

745
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,400
from the outside and you're going to be

746
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
checking if the attacker can exfil

747
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,880
data or whatever is important could be

748
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,799
intellectual property it could be pii

749
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,039
whatever it might be it's important at

750
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,720
your organization

751
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
determining your rules of engagement

752
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
again you're going to be putting in

753
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,159
what's uh going to happen during your

754
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,400
engagement what your objectives are what

755
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,559
you'll do what you won't do so this

756
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,880
might be like spearfishing everyone but

757
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,679
executives um you're going to be laying

758
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,520
out your target network

759
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
uh and what to do

760
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
if for some reason you need to stop the

761
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
engagement what would at least

762
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,240
high-level procedures be maybe you find

763
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,799
an active threat on the network which

764
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,360
will be really bad um what do you do if

765
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,799
that were to occur

766
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,000
um

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,640
and then timeline so you see here

768
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,559
examples 8th of june to 14th of june

769
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,559
we're going to do an initial foothold to

770
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,559
do that we're going to do spearfishing

771
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,440
and there's a physical pen test aspect

772
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
to it that we want to include

773
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,640
for 15 to 21st of june could be we're

774
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,559
going to walk through persistence data

775
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,120
collection discovery credential access

776
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
and how we're going to do that

777
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,200
we won't go through all these examples

778
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
but you get the idea that laying this

779
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,679
out ahead of time will

780
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
save you energy and time when you get

781
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,919
into that execution so laying out a

782
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,840
timeline very important

783
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,600
so let's talk just a little bit about

784
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,760
simulation versus emulation we won't

785
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
deep dive that there are talks courses

786
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
on doing emulations

787
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
however we think that there's a few

788
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
things that we should leave you with uh

789
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,520
when we're talking about the differences

790
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
uh so when we're talking about

791
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,279
simulation versus emulation you see

792
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,720
there on the left uh this plays into

793
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
our planning and execution phases we may

794
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
need to adjust

795
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,399
slightly our playbooks to accommodate

796
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,640
these different uh simulation versus

797
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,520
emulation especially ttps

798
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,559
and how we conduct those so you see

799
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
for both simulation and emulation these

800
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,000
are objective based assessments um

801
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,960
however

802
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,039
in a simulation operators are using

803
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,120
their own ttps

804
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,840
everything is pretty much on the table

805
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,559
uh as long as it's spelled out in the

806
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,760
roe or obviously uh wouldn't be anything

807
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,080
that was illegal but

808
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,720
for the most part any ttp

809
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,399
that you would find in minor or it could

810
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,919
be custom

811
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,440
is on the table whereas with an

812
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,000
emulation you're emulating a specific

813
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,279
threat actor

814
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,120
and in this case uh you're bound uh more

815
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
to emulate and mimic

816
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,840
their ttps based on the threat

817
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,399
intelligence or open source collection

818
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,159
data that you have on that specific

819
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,200
thread actor once you've chosen them

820
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,039
in who you want to mimic during your

821
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,320
exercise and for that

822
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
attack navigator is a great tool that

823
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,200
can help you narrow down and answer some

824
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,039
of the big questions about

825
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,559
what ttps

826
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,039
a specific threat actor will use and

827
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,720
what specific threat actors might be

828
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,840
relevant to my organization and company

829
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,679
looking to the right uh just a little

830
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,399
bit more on examples so let's say with a

831
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,880
simulation we're doing phishing attacks

832
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
and lateral movement that could be more

833
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,559
generically we're going to send phishing

834
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,399
emails to employees

835
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,840
they're going to have malicious payloads

836
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,080
in them in macros and that's how we will

837
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,720
do that simulating a ransomware attack

838
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,960
again more general it could be as simple

839
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,360
as uh dropping flags or commodity

840
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,640
payloads on open smv shares that we find

841
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,440
and

842
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,919
then opening notepad with just a fake

843
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,279
ransomware message to the user to read

844
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,960
whereas you see when we get into an

845
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
emulation we might be still doing the

846
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
same activities but they begin to look a

847
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,799
lot more specific to actual threat

848
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,919
actors

849
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,080
so what you might uh see in that

850
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,159
scenario is

851
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
you begin asking what threats target my

852
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,600
company

853
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,039
you know impact my industry

854
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,360
where i have my headquarters the company

855
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,320
i operate from uh any partnerships that

856
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,799
my company has um

857
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,520
those things will be the basis of what a

858
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,679
potential threat actor would be that is

859
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
targeting my company and once we know

860
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,919
that we want to ask the question that's

861
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,320
probably just as important is do we have

862
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,640
enough applicable ttps

863
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,399
for that threat actor to play out in

864
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,559
that in our environment so

865
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,960
the reason we call that out is if your

866
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,559
environment is

867
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,760
heavy for a particular architecture or

868
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,279
let's say that there's none of that

869
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,840
architecture but this threat actor that

870
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,720
you've chosen relies heavily

871
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,440
the ttps are impactful to that

872
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,279
technology which you don't have you

873
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
might want to take a step back and

874
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,520
rethink you know is there uh more data

875
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,679
to be collected uh do you have enough

876
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
applicable ttps if this is going to be a

877
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,880
good exercise uh if you were to say well

878
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
i'm a political uh campaign firm i've

879
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
chosen apt 28

880
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,039
what would that look like so would i

881
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,760
have enough applicable tptps

882
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,120
and so

883
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,039
going forward with that knowledge and

884
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,640
those considerations

885
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,440
uh again more specifically

886
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,640
if i'm trying to gain initial access uh

887
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
and now i'm bound to say targeting iot

888
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
and voip or printers with default

889
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
credentials can i do that in my

890
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,480
environment if it were for lateral

891
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,600
movement maybe my threat actor being

892
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,679
apt-28 is known to do a lot of past the

893
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,399
hash does that work in my environment

894
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,279
and

895
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,120
if i'm going to be maintaining access um

896
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,919
can i do legitimate credentials probably

897
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,600
so these are things that i want to keep

898
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,399
in mind as i narrow down and limit the

899
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,720
ttps that i'm going to be emulating

900
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,880
during an emulation

901
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
so we won't walk through all of these

902
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,360
but again if we were talking about

903
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,880
emulating ransomware versus a simulation

904
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
more specifically what that would look

905
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,399
like maybe i'm gaining initial access

906
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,200
and

907
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,080
tying it to malicious emails and i'm

908
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,159
focused on the perimeter for a

909
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
particular thread and maintaining access

910
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
could be tied to a very specific tool

911
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
like in the case with darkseid

912
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
teamviewer so keeping those things in

913
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
mind looking at the differences between

914
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
the simulation and emulation these

915
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,760
things uh we specifically think it's

916
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
important to call out

917
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,519
and if you're going to be running an

918
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,480
emulation keep those things in mind when

919
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,679
you uh plan your exercise

920
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,080
so establishing the y cell we won't talk

921
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,679
too much about this but we want you to

922
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,200
know what it is if you're unfamiliar

923
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,279
with the concept as well as some

924
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,440
practical things that we think are

925
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,360
important so

926
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,399
our white cell

927
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,720
is our unbiased communications

928
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
facilitator and sometimes they're our

929
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
referee now hopefully in your

930
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,039
organization your red and blue team uh

931
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,960
you don't have moments where

932
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,760
it gets adversarial uh that would be bad

933
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,880
um but if it did why cell can often help

934
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
is that unbiased

935
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
referee

936
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
in between both teams during the

937
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
exercise it's another value that you get

938
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,799
from the white cell

939
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,399
just quickly some key points um

940
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,600
they are facilitator and a lot of times

941
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
they facilitate a lot of important

942
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,840
deconfliction information between both

943
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,640
teams

944
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,080
we'll talk a little bit about what

945
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
deconfliction means if you're unfamiliar

946
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,159
with that concept

947
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,080
but for now know that they serve that

948
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,440
important role

949
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,640
a lot of times

950
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,600
white cell will lead your outbriefs out

951
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,720
briefs

952
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,279
maybe end of day might be weekly between

953
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,760
red and blue that meeting might be even

954
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,440
monthly whatever works in your

955
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
organization

956
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,760
but why so often

957
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,519
in their capacity leads the outbreaks

958
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,480
and

959
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,960
we want to note that identifying a y

960
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,760
cell

961
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,079
team member can be challenging and the

962
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,280
reason for that is because uh if in your

963
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,320
company you think that uh white cell or

964
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
white cell the person

965
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,879
that wants to play this role uh expects

966
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,560
maybe a couple hours a week where

967
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,719
they're putting on this hat well it's

968
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,480
been our experience white cell was

969
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
basically a full-time job while the

970
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,639
execution and exercise is happening so

971
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,119
know that going in that if a person

972
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,520
wants to play this role that maybe only

973
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,399
has a little bit of time in between say

974
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,119
their normal day job or meetings it's

975
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,599
probably not going to be that effective

976
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,719
um

977
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,079
however

978
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,320
remember too that if you can have a

979
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
white cell member

980
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,040
it's very valuable because otherwise

981
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,960
you're going to be trading especially

982
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,520
with your red team time and energy

983
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,440
so we talked a little bit about the key

984
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,280
points just some additional goals and

985
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,480
benefits

986
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,119
deconfliction this is really where

987
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,440
you don't want your blue team to mistake

988
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
an alert for an actual attacker maybe

989
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,800
they think it's the red team

990
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,680
and valuable time is lost uh we don't

991
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,119
want that to happen

992
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,440
we want the blue team to investigate

993
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
make um

994
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,079
accurate but fast conclusions and

995
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,320
ultimately relay that to our white cell

996
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,560
for deconfliction is it the is it the

997
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,119
red team is it not the red team do we

998
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
need to focus

999
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,240
uh more on this than that um this is an

1000
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,599
important thing to ensure

1001
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,200
that deconfliction of information

1002
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,880
happens um exercise outbreaks again

1003
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
this could be daily or weekly and

1004
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,119
whatever works for your teams

1005
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,760
but it's important to the exercise

1006
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,800
to have that cross-flow of information

1007
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
and then again

1008
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,720
white cell services that sandy check and

1009
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,839
sometimes referee between the two teams

1010
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,240
and finally reporting it's been our

1011
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,760
experience that white cell also

1012
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
sometimes they remember things

1013
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,760
differently and more accurately than

1014
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,240
maybe red team did or blue team maybe

1015
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,079
red team doesn't quite remember

1016
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,320
something gets missed from the log

1017
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
white cell is another person

1018
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,320
involved in the exercise that can say no

1019
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
no it happened this way or

1020
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,480
what i wrote down was this so reporting

1021
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,839
is another place where they can be

1022
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,480
really valuable

1023
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
and so the green cell uh to us uh not

1024
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,320
too many teams uh have this luxury a

1025
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
team dedicated to managing red team or

1026
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,960
whatever infrastructure you might have

1027
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
in your environment um but they play

1028
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,000
that part so they manage uh the red team

1029
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,880
other

1030
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,359
infrastructure related

1031
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,680
infrastructure related

1032
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,599
systems

1033
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
they will be the administrator of any

1034
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,560
special software or hardware

1035
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,680
that might be used

1036
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,119
often the red team

1037
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,400
ends up managing their own

1038
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,920
infrastructure

1039
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,240
but again

1040
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,800
there's a trade-off if

1041
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,839
if there is no white cell or green cell

1042
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,800
and in terms of goals and benefits uh

1043
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,200
resourcing and resiliency no different

1044
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
than any other it system if you have

1045
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,200
special infrastructure

1046
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,640
involved in your exercise a green cell

1047
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
not only ensures that

1048
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
somebody's there to manage the systems

1049
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
but they're available during the

1050
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
exercise it's like any other outage uh

1051
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
with it if your infrastructure goes down

1052
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,000
it's going to impact the exercise

1053
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
possibly the environment could stop the

1054
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,359
exercise

1055
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,760
and so if you happen to be on a cyber

1056
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,480
range um or

1057
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,400
a private range versus your production

1058
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
network there's

1059
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
trade-offs obviously to each one

1060
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
we won't go into

1061
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,160
that really

1062
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,040
but

1063
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,960
cyber ranges can be

1064
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,480
really awesome

1065
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
but they often require completely

1066
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
separate infrastructure if you have any

1067
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,680
special software like traffic generators

1068
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,599
uh things of those types that are

1069
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,400
especially useful in cyber ranges this

1070
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
is where green cell really

1071
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,560
is helpful in managing all of that

1072
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,440
so we'll talk about the execution in our

1073
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,839
aars

1074
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,560
again on the left side you see our

1075
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,760
key points

1076
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
we think it's really important to

1077
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,359
strictly follow your rules of engagement

1078
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,560
always

1079
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
we also think it's important to call out

1080
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,160
that red team should not do anything

1081
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,400
that obstructs the blue team's ability

1082
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
to investigate

1083
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,040
for example turning off edr tools

1084
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
things like that that could blind the

1085
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
blue team now i know that sometimes

1086
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,599
especially in later when teams are very

1087
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,240
mature there may be

1088
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,760
times where you want to do cyber

1089
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,680
deception campaigns and things like that

1090
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,320
where you are actually obscuring maybe

1091
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,599
blue team's view but most of the time

1092
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,119
you don't want to do anything in your

1093
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,560
exercises

1094
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,079
is going to hinder the blue team's

1095
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,359
ability to investigate and respond

1096
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,320
and

1097
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
also for red team

1098
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,079
if you're not getting caught easily

1099
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,839
increase the level of noise at some

1100
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,599
point in your exercise you can think

1101
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,839
about when the appropriate time is based

1102
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,760
on your operations

1103
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
but increase the noise so blue team has

1104
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
the ability to

1105
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,640
develop some iocs to hunt you by is

1106
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,480
going to make a better exercise for both

1107
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,599
teams

1108
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,320
and so on the right side again examples

1109
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,680
um we talked about uh aar as being a

1110
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
military concept kind of like an

1111
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,640
improvement plan this just lays out

1112
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
another piece of your reporting

1113
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,119
of what went well what didn't go well

1114
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,040
what can be improved and how you want to

1115
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,599
plan for future success doesn't have to

1116
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,560
be

1117
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,599
super verbose but capturing these items

1118
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,119
will add

1119
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,040
again maturity and rigor to your

1120
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,839
exercises for both teams so what you see

1121
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
on the right side for red that might be

1122
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,599
that the redirectors that you deployed

1123
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,119
really helped obfuscate your c2

1124
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,839
infrastructure from the blue team

1125
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,599
and made it more challenging for them

1126
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,680
and help the red team so for blue it

1127
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,920
might be correctly and quickly

1128
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,800
identifying uh red team's smb password

1129
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
sprays that led them to a compromised

1130
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
laptop on the network that was on a

1131
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,040
marketing segment maybe wasn't as

1132
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,440
protected as other segments uh we won't

1133
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,240
go through all of these um but you get

1134
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,760
the idea of how you want to uh develop

1135
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,760
your aar uh in all your exercises

1136
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,880
so we'll talk a little bit about um

1137
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,240
adversary emulation again

1138
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
just some additional things that we want

1139
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,119
to leave you with um again it's a little

1140
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
things that will be important uh

1141
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,640
especially

1142
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,760
during your planning and execution so

1143
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
again

1144
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,760
just some additional considerations uh

1145
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
they may require more white carding uh

1146
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,560
during your execution especially and

1147
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,800
that's okay it's okay to use white cards

1148
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,359
make sure to log it into your report so

1149
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,720
that everybody knows why it was used

1150
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,800
and remember that not all ttps will be

1151
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,920
applicable

1152
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
uh some won't be stealthy some won't

1153
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,760
even be possible so

1154
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,000
you want to emulate a threat actor known

1155
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
to have the resources to do zero days um

1156
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,960
not everybody can burn a zero day on a

1157
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,400
red team exercise

1158
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
most of us i'd say

1159
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,280
cannot um that's all right though we can

1160
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
still have a

1161
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,200
productive exercise emulating or

1162
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
mimicking those ttps

1163
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,440
of that threat actor and remember too

1164
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,280
um ttps from a specific threat actor

1165
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,000
today have probably evolved so even what

1166
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,079
we know about that threat actor and how

1167
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,560
they uh work in environments during

1168
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
their operations has probably changed

1169
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,079
they're probably not doing exactly the

1170
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,119
same thing

1171
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,359
they're not using the exact same tools

1172
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,880
that's okay there's still value in doing

1173
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,280
apt or red team

1174
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,640
emulations

1175
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,119
but just keep those things in in mind

1176
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,119
and how to still get that value

1177
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,359
and sometimes it can be

1178
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,520
helpful to have an insider

1179
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,319
sometimes this could be why cell

1180
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,000
it could be someone from your it staff

1181
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,760
but they will help you be able to

1182
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,520
emulate certain parts of your

1183
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,800
exercise

1184
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,160
that might not be possible otherwise and

1185
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,640
you'll still still be able to get

1186
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,319
validity from those ttps and be able to

1187
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,480
have a blue potentially detect and

1188
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,440
respond and so keep that in mind as well

1189
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,839
so remediation we'll talk a little bit

1190
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,000
about remediation and how we see and

1191
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,400
break down remediation we put it into

1192
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,760
two categories uh prevention and

1193
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,000
detection and response so prevention is

1194
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,079
anything that denies it degrades or

1195
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,400
disrupts the attackers tactics costing

1196
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,640
them time and stealth

1197
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,960
for detection and response this is

1198
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,079
really anything that involves the

1199
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,640
collection monitoring for say a bypass

1200
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,720
of preventative controls as well as

1201
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,520
things that cannot be prevented

1202
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,599
not everything can be prevented but

1203
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
usually everything can be detected so

1204
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,480
just some examples of those for

1205
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,280
prevention putting in place mfa

1206
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,359
putting in additional network

1207
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,599
segmentation maybe having a stronger

1208
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,319
password policy all great preventative

1209
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,440
controls

1210
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,319
in looking at the detection and response

1211
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,040
so again not everything can be prevented

1212
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,839
motto talked about dc sync we may not be

1213
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,480
able to always prevent it but if it

1214
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,720
happens we can detect and we can have a

1215
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,680
robust response to that if the detection

1216
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,200
were to fire

1217
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,480
and mfa is a great preventative control

1218
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,560
but we all know that there are bypasses

1219
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,160
out there um so what happens if mfa is

1220
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,319
bypassed can we detect it and can we

1221
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,640
adequately respond to it and of course

1222
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,480
things that are very difficult

1223
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,359
in cases to be able to

1224
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,319
prevent and also difficult at times to

1225
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,960
detect and respond to would be

1226
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,839
abusing legitimate user accounts or in

1227
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,800
cases of legitimate admin accounts these

1228
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,000
are the things that we want to be able

1229
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,040
to detect abnormal activity or use of

1230
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,680
those accounts and be able to take

1231
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,118
an effective response to it

1232
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,800
so looking at this slide we talked uh

1233
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
earlier when we looked at this slide

1234
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,640
more to the left of our planning

1235
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
execution and aars now we're going to

1236
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,920
talk a little bit more about the

1237
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,839
reporting the remediation

1238
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,599
all the way over to

1239
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,280
uh the right side where we're going to

1240
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,440
have our blind test

1241
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
for response

1242
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,839
so we'll be taking our ttps used in the

1243
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,040
red team exercise there you see in the

1244
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,560
execution step

1245
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,359
those ttps will be the basis of our unit

1246
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,240
tests and those will be used to build

1247
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,880
new or better detections whether our

1248
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,560
ttps are

1249
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,000
mapped to say miter attack or if they're

1250
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,920
custom

1251
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,240
custom ttbs really doesn't matter

1252
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,200
we will be able to take either path

1253
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,400
and our purple team exercises

1254
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,040
and detection pipeline process work for

1255
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,359
building and testing detections from

1256
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,000
either so during our unit tests for

1257
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,280
detection

1258
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,160
as a team we will slow down we will

1259
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,119
be replaying the ttps used in the red

1260
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,640
team engagement and we're going to

1261
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,599
validate uh our expected alerts are

1262
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,079
triggered and once we have high fidelity

1263
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,200
detections working our red team will do

1264
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,680
that blind test using those ttps to

1265
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,359
validate that we have an effective

1266
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,640
response

1267
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,880
and last thing we want to know that this

1268
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,720
is a great place to measure team

1269
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,760
improvement we think about that as how

1270
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,480
much time did it take say initially

1271
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,119
during our execution in our regime

1272
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,240
exercise uh to detect something or if we

1273
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,040
didn't detect it all and to respond and

1274
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,319
now

1275
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,520
how much faster is that

1276
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,920
after our purple team says and this can

1277
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,599
really be the basis of showing

1278
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,960
improvement

1279
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,079
and we'll talk a little bit about

1280
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,760
metrics and reporting

1281
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
so

1282
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,200
metrics and tools metrics demonstrate

1283
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,319
again that improvement in that value we

1284
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,560
think about important

1285
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,440
metrics in terms of time time is a key

1286
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,000
metric in our opinion time is money

1287
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,560
whether you're an attacker or a defender

1288
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,319
attackers want to orient to the

1289
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,440
environment

1290
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
faster than defenders and defenders want

1291
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,200
to kick out uh the attackers uh from the

1292
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,920
environment faster than the attacker can

1293
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,720
achieve their objectives right so time

1294
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,839
is key

1295
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,839
we won't deep dive all of these tools

1296
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,000
or even the metrics but we want to leave

1297
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,400
you with some tools that we think are

1298
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,839
great and could be helpful for

1299
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,920
doing metrics and reporting

1300
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,920
when you do your exercises uh and um

1301
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,760
what comes out of those so you see here

1302
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,000
again key adversarial metrics could be

1303
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,240
like mean time to compromise mean time

1304
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,160
for privilege escalation for renting for

1305
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,559
blue team could be mean time to detect

1306
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,839
mean time to respond and meantime for

1307
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,040
recovery

1308
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,599
some tools that will help you do that

1309
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,720
you see

1310
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,000
on the right side uh detection navigator

1311
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,280
which moto mod talked about

1312
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,760
that can be uh very useful that we've

1313
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,800
found

1314
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,599
as well as miter tag navigator uh attack

1315
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,480
navigator will also be useful in your

1316
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,800
emulation planning if you're doing one

1317
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,880
and then also

1318
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,160
you can check out uh detect and vector

1319
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,480
uh also some useful tools in this

1320
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,040
category

1321
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,960
so

1322
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,079
uh at the end of our adversarial

1323
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,119
services lifecycle is going to provide

1324
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,680
feedback on all the great work

1325
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,160
that was completed during phase one two

1326
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,839
and three

1327
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,520
it's going to help train the blue team

1328
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,800
to engage

1329
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,599
be able to track and be able to hunt for

1330
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,599
adversaries whether it's the red team or

1331
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,839
an actual adversary

1332
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,880
and our remediation fees uh is going to

1333
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,119
ensure that improvements in prevention

1334
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,680
detection response and our overall

1335
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,640
posture is improving and of course the

1336
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,880
strong preventions and detections are

1337
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,160
really the foundations of a strong

1338
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,599
response

1339
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,079
you're going to be able to show progress

1340
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,559
and value

1341
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,559
by repeating

1342
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,559
all of these phases all these phases are

1343
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,960
recurring and um

1344
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,880
they're going to work for whatever type

1345
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,359
of exercise you are planning

1346
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,440
so in closing uh again we think that

1347
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,720
blue team

1348
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
can use this training to proactively

1349
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,760
hunt for example uh let's say that an

1350
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,680
exploit is released for a zero day

1351
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,400
doesn't really matter if it's a zero day

1352
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,119
or a five-day whatever it might be blue

1353
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,480
team's going to be able to use this

1354
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,680
methodology to proactively hunt uh with

1355
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,119
iocs for a zero-day exploit

1356
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,920
whatever it might be

1357
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
and be able to build detections from the

1358
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,119
iocs

1359
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,599
again all phases are methodically linked

1360
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,599
they're recurring and they provide you

1361
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,319
the basis for continuous security

1362
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,559
posture improvement especially around

1363
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,880
detection response

1364
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,800
and importantly as well it's going to

1365
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,960
provide transparency to your leadership

1366
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,839
team

1367
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,960
they're going to see the value of what

1368
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,800
their budgets are

1369
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,040
doing they're going to see all the great

1370
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,839
red team assessment findings all the

1371
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,119
improvement with time and in regards to

1372
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,400
what comes out of your purple team

1373
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,680
exercises and all the great detections

1374
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,359
and response

1375
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,680
that your team is improving with and so

1376
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,520
they're going to know again

1377
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,599
what they're getting for their money

1378
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,520
the metrics the documentation and the

1379
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,920
communication all of these

1380
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,400
coming out will be improved especially

1381
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
around reporting and communication this

1382
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,960
will build additional transparency so

1383
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,599
that your management teams understand

1384
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,839
all the great things that the

1385
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,640
teams are doing

1386
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,040
so

1387
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,200
and with that we'd like to give a big

1388
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
thanks to everyone
