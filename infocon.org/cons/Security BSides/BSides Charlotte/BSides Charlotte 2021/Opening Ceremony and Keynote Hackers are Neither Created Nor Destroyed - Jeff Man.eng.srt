124
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
i guess uh before we get to

125
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
uh genie with an intro for our keynote i

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
did want to point out that uh this

127
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
conference again we're we're virtual

128
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,319
this year last uh last year we we made

129
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,800
that decision for covid this year we did

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,080
as well we're definitely planning for

131
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
in-person in 2022 we're

132
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
a lot more comfortable with where things

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
are looking now they're not great but we

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,280
trust that things will improve by that

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
point uh so so stay tuned closing

136
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
ceremonies will provide details on 2022

137
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
and what that looks like

138
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
to hopefully

139
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
move

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
primarily out of virtual space we will

141
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,479
likely still continue to have a virtual

142
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
presence because

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
having this virtual platform has been an

144
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
amazing opportunity to bring other

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
speakers to

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
you from a presentation standpoint that

147
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
we otherwise would have had a lot more

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,919
difficulty doing

149
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
we did so last year with with

150
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,000
international speakers and again this

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
year with two of our

152
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000

it's always a mixed bag having to do the

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,760
virtual versus real i i much would

235
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,640
prefer to be real i think everybody

236
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,440
would

237
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,399
um

238
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,000
ironically

239
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
uh when i ran in uh to some of the

240
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519

time it's it's rather

287
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,200
an extensive career and i've been very

288
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
fortunate in the opportunities i've had

289
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,000
throughout my career

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920

jeannie telling you

294
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,000
um one of the purposes of this talk that

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,360
i put together

296
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,079
and

297
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,320
full disclosure i gave this talk uh

298
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
initially a couple weeks ago at girkon

299
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,920
actually live

300
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
and i'll apologize ahead of time some of

301
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,160
the the slides are oriented towards

302
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
audience participation which obviously

303
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,399
is going to be difficult this morning

304
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,160
in the virtual space

305
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,279
um

306
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,399
but

307
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,360
you know the title of my talk uh hackers

308
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
are neither created or nor destroyed

309
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,040
is partially because

310
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,959
back in the back in the former times

311
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
after speaking at conferences i would

312
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
very often get approached by people

313
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,000
asking

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
me various variations of a question you

315
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
know how do i become a hacker

316
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
how do i get into

317
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
cyber security how do i get into red

318
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
teaming pen testing

319
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
you know how how do i do this

320
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,560
and you know variation would be well how

321
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,360
did you get into it and i usually just

322
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,240
tell the story well i started in nsa and

323
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
that's usually

324
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
uh as far as i go with it because most

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,880
people think well okay nsa that that's

326
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,560
obviously a pedigree

327
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
uh within our space

328
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
if that doesn't make sense to you

329
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,160
you know when i started at nsa i started

330
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
in an in an organization

331
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,399
uh where the name of the organization

332
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,160
was information security so that was

333
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
kind of our main business we weren't a a

334
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
company that was also building widgets

335
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,760
or selling widgets or producing software

336
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
or equipment or anything like that our

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
focus actually was information security

338
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
and i i was lucky enough to be

339
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
born at a time where i grew up in in the

340
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
very beginnings of the internet and we

341
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
used to call it internet security

342
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,320
and and you know

343
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
on to where we are today

344
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,959
so

345
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,760
you know a lot of how i got to where i

346
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
am is simply just being at the right

347
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
place at the right time and i think if

348
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,560
you ask a lot of people um that is

349
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
that's sort of a way

350
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,160
that a lot of people

351
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,839
uh venture into this space

352
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,399
um

353
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,240
you know this is where it's like okay i

354
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
haven't seen everybody in two years

355
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
because of the lockdown and of course

356
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,839
we're virtual again but uh

357
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,120
some of the things that i've been doing

358
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
over the last couple years

359
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,160
which also is sort of a segue into in

360
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,800
into what i want to talk about today

361
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,519
um jeannie mentioned i'm i'm a host of

362
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,160
paul security weekly uh paul actually

363
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
gave me my own show just about two years

364
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
ago called security and compliance

365
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
weekly

366
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,959
where

367
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,680
i was either rewarded by always talking

368
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,079
about compliance i talk about pci a lot

369
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,160
or he put me off in a corner still not

370
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,680
sure which one it was

371
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
but the the goal of this podcast

372
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,880
at least for me is to try to bring

373
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,839
together

374
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
multiple communities within our with uh

375
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
within our field of cyber security i've

376
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
spent the last couple years going

377
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,360
through

378
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
um

379
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
going to hacker conferences a lot of

380
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,240
b-sides

381
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
uh you know all the big name conferences

382
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,759
i saw somebody tweet this morning uh

383
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,199
apparently we're somewhere around the

384
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,279
anniversary of when derbycon would be

385
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,000
and somebody put out the obligatory

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,480
trevor forget tweet

387
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,759
if you don't know what that is you're

388
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,759
probably better off in my opinion but

389
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,639
i'm a

390
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
grumpy old man

391
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
but i also go to security conferences

392
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
more the vendor side of conferences

393
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,319
type of conferences information security

394
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,880
conferences compliance conferences the

395
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,520
pci industry has their own conference

396
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
and something that's impressed me over

397
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,119
the past couple years when we were doing

398
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,280
these things live was there's a lot of

399
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
smart people all over this industry and

400
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,720
there's a lot of people doing great

401
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
things and

402
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
very often they don't know that the

403
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
other side exists

404
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,039
and so

405
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,200
one of the main focuses of my show is to

406
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,280
try to bring in people from both sides

407
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,080
or both both silos both both and there's

408
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
more than two really but bring in

409
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
multiple people multiple personalities

410
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
multiple people that are smart doing

411
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
great things interesting things have

412
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
stories to tell to expose the other side

413
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,760
to oh there's people like me over there

414
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
and they're doing a lot of the same

415
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,400
things because

416
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
uh this is a huge industry at the end at

417
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,320
the end of the day there's so much

418
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
responsibility there's so much

419
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,559
complexity to all the nuances of

420
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,360
uh what we do in this thing called cyber

421
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
security and

422
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,280
uh you know lots of supporting roles

423
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
lots of lots of front line roles but you

424
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,559
know all told we're all in this together

425
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,559
um

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
uh

427
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
jenny mentioned i'm sorry genie

428
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280

they

457
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
put together a a

458
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,799
survey a series of questions

459
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,440
um you know how'd you get your start and

460
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,280
security what are your what are your

461
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
triumphs and losses what what would you

462
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
do again if you could all sorts of

463
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,880
different types of questions and they

464
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
put these questions out to

465
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
all sorts of people in the industry that

466
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
are recognized in their fields of

467
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,520
expertise and and and you know obviously

468
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,160
call up call them hackers so every

469
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,799
chapter of each book is a different

470
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
person responding to the same questions

471
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,799
it's a fascinating uh series very very

472
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,360
informative and educational i highly

473
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
recommend it to everybody and stay tuned

474
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
it's going to be an audio book so i'm

475
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,280
going to be in the next couple weeks

476
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
recording my chapter of the first book

477
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
and i think over the course of the next

478
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,640
six months or so they'll get through all

479
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,520
the books so kind of a cool opportunity

480
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,360
and i'm looking forward to it

481
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,520
um also in the in the last year or so

482
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
i've been involved over the last couple

483
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,760
years with a an organization also a

484
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
non-profit called hack for kids

485
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
hopefully some of you have heard of it

486
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
it's it's a it's an organization that's

487
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
focused on teaching

488
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,360
not only the technical skills to to

489
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,919
young people but also hacking skills so

490
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,799
they they very often put on

491
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
as a group sort of mini conferences just

492
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,640
for kids as part of other regular hacker

493
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,960
security conferences and do a lot of the

494
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,240
same things in terms of capture the flag

495
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,480
exercises having lockpicked villages one

496
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,640
of the fun things they do is they get

497
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,039
people to volunteer and donate

498
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,720
old equipment of any kind it could be

499
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,840
tvs vcrs

500
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,760
computers tablets whatever and they let

501
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,960
kids just

502
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
rip them apart break them apart

503
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
you know no agenda just tear this thing

504
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
apart see what you think

505
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,799
experience it um anyway they i spoke for

506
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,559
them a couple years ago at their main

507
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
conference with students which is in

508
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,159
chicago and they asked me to join the

509
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,640
board and we came up with this title

510
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,000
of the

511
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,799
director of diversity equity and

512
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,039
inclusion my focus is trying to make

513
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
sure that um

514
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
what hack for kids and what we're doing

515
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
as a community to bring others up and

516
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,000
bring others into the field uh is is

517
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
something that's available for everyone

518
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
uh regardless of

519
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,480
you know race religion creed ethnicity

520
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
orientation

521
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
uh culture

522
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
geographic location whatever i mean one

523
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,760
thing i think we as a country learned in

524
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
the past year and a half is that there's

525
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,679
a lot of disparity just in terms of

526
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
opportunity for access to technology and

527
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
internet frankly uh throughout the

528
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
country depending on where where you

529
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,720
happen to be born by no fault of your

530
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
own so that's something that i'm i'm

531
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
interested and passionate about and

532
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
always open to ideas and if anybody has

533
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,960
ideas or wants something like hat for

534

let any of us know

537
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
um

538
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,559
i'm i i have a day job i work for

539
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,200
company called online business systems

540
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,919
uh i i work in the pci field is what's

541
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,159
called a qualified security assessor or

542
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,919
qsa

543
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,480
my job is to go into companies that are

544
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,039
responsible for meeting pci data

545
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,919
security requirements and i assess

546
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
whether they're actually following the

547
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,960
rules and doing everything that they're

548
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
supposed to be doing

549
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
um

550
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,159
and uh i do that and i've been doing

551
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,280
that for 17 years why i like doing it

552
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
and why i talk about pci

553
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,919
my little pci moment is a pci is a solid

554
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,720
framework for basic security

555
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,240
things that everybody should be doing no

556
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,159
matter what

557
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,840
most of the companies that have to do it

558
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,600
are not companies that are historically

559
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,320
involved in security or have security as

560
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
part of their

561
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
fabric uh you know organizational

562
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
structure it's not part of the their

563
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,480
history

564
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,679
um

565
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,840
and so they don't understand it so i i

566
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
spent a lot of time

567
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
uh you know just trying to explain what

568
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
it all means and putting it in context

569
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
because i think it's very reasonable if

570
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
you understand security requirements

571
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
most people say well that makes sense

572
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
yeah we should do that and that gets you

573
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,799
over the hurdle of people doing the bare

574
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
minimum just want the check box which

575
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
if you've heard of pci it very often is

576
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,320
labeled as a as a check box compliance

577
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,559
exercise which unfortunately a lot of

578
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,279
people treat it like that i'm sort of on

579
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,559
on a mission to try to dispel that uh

580
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,240
attitude and try to get people to

581
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,400
understand no this is basic security

582
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,559
stuff that you need to do in an

583
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,840
organization

584
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,760
um anyway enough of the pci minute

585
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
this is the the company i work for

586
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
we're a consulting practice primarily we

587
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
do a lot of the compliance things we do

588
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,559
security architecture

589
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
recommend solutions we have a security

590
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,400
testing team

591
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
uh we've got a pretty decent team of pen

592
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,799
testers web app testers so on and so

593
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,960
forth and and we get a lot of work so

594
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
we're always hiring so keep that in mind

595
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
if you are job seeking now or in the

596
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,320
future

597
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,279
um

598
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,559
if you've heard me uh speak

599
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,039
at other conferences or

600
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,799
you know conferences talks are very

601
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,679
often available online on youtube

602
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,600
one of the things that i did early on in

603
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,960
my career at nsa as a cryptographer was

604
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
work with the u.s special forces

605
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,520
back in those days they used a paper

606
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,919
one-time pad for communications and i

607
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,679
developed a little

608
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
uh cryptographic

609
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,159
cipher wheel special specially designed

610
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,279
to be

611
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
able to work with the the the one-time

612
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,840
pad that the special forces use

613
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,240
they called it the the whiz wheel

614
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,279
i came to find out

615
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,360
the last real defcon before the shutdown

616
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,760
back in 2019 i happened to meet a guy

617
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,440
that was ex-special forces that

618
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
remembered using my wheel

619
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
and over the course of the lockdown uh

620
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
he happened to also be the chapter uh

621
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
president for the special forces

622
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
association which as you can imagine is

623
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,919
for ex-special forces ex-green berets

624
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,480
but they have the associate

625
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
uh membership

626
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,840
available and he said you know you would

627
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,080
qualify because you know what you did

628
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,159
really helped the mission so long story

629
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,880
short he was able to get me a lifetime

630
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
membership into the special force

631
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,559
association he helped me apply for it

632
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,039
and and i was

633
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
given a lifetime membership

634
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,760
uh you know i used to spend a lot of

635
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,559
time in fayetteville north carolina so

636
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
there's a little bit of a north carolina

637
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,559
connection here as well uh in the

638
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
fayetteville area of course at fort

639
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,440
bragg

640
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,480
um

641
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,279
one other thing or among other things

642
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,080
notable is uh i was interviewed actually

643
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
along with marcus carey for an episode

644
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,840
of darknet diaries uh where i tell uh

645
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,400
pretty much the origin story of how

646
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,279
penetration testing uh got started at

647
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,480
nsa

648
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,520
back

649
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,480
in the

650
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
mid early to mid 1990s um

651
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,720
i'm i'm embarrassed and shocked to say

652
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
that it's been almost 30 years since i

653
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,919
started uh penetration testing and doing

654
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,520
you know internet security trying to

655
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,320
break into computers and networks

656
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
uh which just makes me feel old and

657
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
makes me feel tired

658
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,880
um

659
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
one other thing that that happened is

660
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,159
and sort of is the segue into this talk

661
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,120
uh ultimately or one of the reasons is i

662
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
was asked to become an advocate

663
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,760
for another non-profit called hacking is

664
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
not a crime

665
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
um

666
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,600
and and speaking of hacking that that's

667
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,440
one of the reasons that got me thinking

668
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
about

669
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,840
you know what it what does it mean to be

670
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
a hacker

671
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
how do i know i'm a hacker how do i

672
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
become a hacker how do how do i get the

673
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
skills how do i learn hacking skills it

674
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
all kind of jumbled together in my mind

675
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,919
but but part of it frankly was when i

676
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
was asked to join this group and i was

677
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
reading through

678
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,480
um

679
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,159
you know some of their bylaws and

680
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,840
mission statements and so on and so

681
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,120
forth um

682
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,440
my to be honest my initial knee jerk

683
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,840
reaction is uh you know every time i'm

684
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
approached by someone that says how do i

685
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,279
become a hacker in my mind i think

686
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,159
uh if you have to ask that question

687
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,520
you're probably not a hacker

688
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,480
but

689
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
i i i'm always trying to to check myself

690
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,760
because i don't want to be arrogant and

691
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,440
think well i'm a hacker and you're not

692
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
and therefore i'm better than you i

693
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,039
think it's more to the point and this is

694
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,640
what i want to try to bring out in this

695
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
talk this morning

696
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,840
is that

697
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,679
uh it's more important to find out who

698
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,720
you are

699
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
uh and and find out what you're uh good

700
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,720
at what you like to do what you have

701
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,240
some talent or aptitude or or potential

702
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,279
to do

703
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,960
and and pursue that and it's not really

704
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,760
uh

705
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,120
this is for the people that may not be

706
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,880
hackers it doesn't matter if you're not

707
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
a hacker you can still excel and exceed

708
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,919
and have a lot of fun and a lot of

709
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,820
satisfaction in

710
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,440
[Music]

711
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
you know success

712
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,120
which is a weird word because how do you

713
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,399
define that

714
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
in this industry pursuing so many things

715
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,080
because there's so many different things

716
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,960
you can do in this industry if you are

717
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
if you do happen to be a hacker

718
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,799
uh what i'm going to talk about could

719
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,360
help reinforce and maybe make you feel a

720
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,559
little bit more

721
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,039
uh accepted or you know

722
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
oh i'm not a i'm not the only one that

723
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,799
thinks like this or acts like this or

724
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,919
does this

725
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,039
um but this organization essentially is

726
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
trying to

727
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,600
do i think one of two things uh you know

728
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
at a high level one is just you know to

729
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,559
try to dispel the the notion that hacker

730
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,799
means a bad guy um

731
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,039
which is the part that i'm like

732
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,520
kind of the least interested in because

733
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
we in this industry and i and i've been

734
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,919
in this industry and especially in the

735
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,799
computer hacking internet hacking space

736
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,640
essentially from the beginning

737
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
this has been an argument that's been

738
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
going on for you know 30 years and

739
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
counting and i don't think we're ever

740
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,640
gonna

741
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,200
really shift the mindset doesn't mean we

742
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,399
don't try

743
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,120
but

744
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
uh i think more importantly the the

745
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
other goal of this organization is to

746
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,960
try to promote

747
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,440
uh and help out with uh you know

748
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,679
proposed legislation that tries to make

749
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,799
hacking activities illegal and

750
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
uh i i think that's

751
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,399
more the key element of this

752
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,440
organization is to try to

753
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,799
you know

754
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,200
make sure that the the the the

755
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,960
inaccurate uh

756
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,080
mindset of or or beliefs about what it

757
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
means to be a hacker or what hacking is

758
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,720
doesn't negatively impact the hacking

759
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
community especially in it within the

760
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,520
realm of computer internet

761
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,960
uh

762
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,679
technology hacking that we do do today

763
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,240
they have also key tenants and i can i

764
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,120
can put them up here let you read them

765
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
of course you can find

766
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,279
the website and learn more about this

767
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,480
organization

768
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
i i will i will have a get off my lawn

769
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,720
moment as a grumpy curmudgeon

770
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,640
and uh one of the tenants they point out

771
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,159
there that i've highlighted is they're

772
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,000
trying to discourage the use of the

773
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,640
terminology white hat versus black hat

774
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
you know to define good and bad you know

775
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,559
because of the

776
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,600
uh the racial overtones the the ethnic

777
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
overtones uh

778
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,559
you know how we as a society of tried to

779
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,679
move away shift away from white meaning

780
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,640
good black meaning bad which i get i

781
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,159
mean but you know this has been around

782
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,440
in our culture for a long time

783
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
um it's

784
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
i i kind of tend to think that it's it's

785
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,440
not necessarily the origins in terms of

786
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,279
a racial thing uh and undermining

787
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,480
uh people that don't look like me uh i

788
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,279
i'd like to think it's more a contrast

789
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,480
scientifically sort of the the opposite

790
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,799
ends of the spectrum to to point out

791
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,559
that there's a huge difference

792
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,240
i point out this one in particular

793
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,559
because i will probably slip and say

794
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
white hat or black hat at some point and

795
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,880
i apologize ahead of time but for this

796
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
morning's um

797
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,080
lesson in in race relations uh and i i

798
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,519
put this slide back in at the last

799
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,200
minute because torrey mentioned star

800
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,519
trek and and i had to remove this

801
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,720
because i didn't want to go down this

802
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
road but if you want to have the classic

803
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,320
lesson on why racism is stupid go back

804
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,799
to star trek the original series and

805
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,200
find an episode i think it's called this

806
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
let this be your last battle where these

807
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,000
two planets have been at war for you

808
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,240
know decades centuries

809
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,039
and

810
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
and because they're different and you

811
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
have to look carefully and this is where

812
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,159
it's easier to have audience

813
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,720
participation and people shout back but

814
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
these two people are different and

815
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
because they're different they

816
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,960
fought wars and were killing each other

817
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
for for years and years and years and of

818
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,799
course captain kirk and the enterprise

819
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,320
came in and saved the dave and helped

820
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
them understand that their differences

821
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
were stupid but look carefully the

822
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,320
difference between them and this is the

823
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
beauty of star trek and at least the

824
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,919
original series the the societal lessons

825
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,679
that they tried to teach and and the

826
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,880
societal

827
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
um

828
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,919
norms that they went after

829
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,640
one person here is black on the right

830
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,880
side white on the left side while the

831
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
other one is the opposite white on the

832
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,760
right side black on the left side

833
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,640
it takes you a while to see it but that

834
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,480
i thought this was the classic example

835
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,919
of pointing out why racism is stupid uh

836
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,320
so my nod to star trek and and the

837
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
brilliance of the original series and

838
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
all the other series but i'm an original

839
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,480
series kind of guy

840
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,919
um

841
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,000
i want to spend a few minutes uh just

842
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,720
talking about you know sort of uh you

843
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
know some of the things that hacking is

844
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,120
not a crime is trying to tackle in a

845
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
visual sense of course

846
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
uh you know the depictions in hollywood

847
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
of course of hackers

848
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
uh

849
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,760
you know

850
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,640
i i

851
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
i could have spent a whole uh you know

852
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,559
hour just talking about all the

853
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,799
depictions i just tried to capture some

854
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,480
you know here's some of the boys that we

855
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,360
know

856
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,679
uh from you know

857
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,559
hollywood uh depictions of course there

858
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,519
are women hackers out there and and you

859
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,519
know more than i can put on one slide

860
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,960
what i thought was interesting when i

861
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,440
was you know looking for these images is

862
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
um

863
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,239
typically

864
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,520
you know there's exceptions to every

865
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,359
rule but typically the

866
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,599
um or very often the the male hackers

867
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,879
uh

868
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,800
there are the they are the bad guys in

869
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
the movies and the tv shows not all the

870
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
time of course and and very often the

871
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
women are the ones that are the good

872
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,960
guys the ones that are doing things for

873
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,719
the side of good trying to catch the bad

874
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,839
guys

875
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,639
um uh

876
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,320
you know for a live audience at this

877
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,560
point i would ask an opinion poll this

878
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,719
is because paul acidore and i have sort

879
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,879
of this running bet because we asked

880
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,879
this question of our guests on the main

881
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,480
show paul security weekly what's your

882
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,359
favorite hacker movie and uh his

883
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,918
favorite hacker movie is hackers my

884
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,079
favorite hacker movie is sneakers and we

885
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,159
each have our reasons why

886
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,720
um so this is sort of you know i always

887
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
like to find out and and we're sort of

888
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,960
keeping an informal tally of you know

889
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,599
which one of this is right type of thing

890
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,440
in the context because this is a virtual

891
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
talk and i it was pointed out to me

892
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,880
after i did this

893
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
at girkon the other week

894
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
uh there are a lot of younger people in

895
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
this community that

896
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,880
actually may not have seen these movies

897
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,480
therefore don't know what they're about

898
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,079
so rather than asking you what's your

899
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,560
favorite hacker movie just very quickly

900
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,680
the movie movie war games and this is a

901
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
an encouragement if you haven't seen any

902
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,160
of these movies go watch them because

903
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,520
this is sort of

904
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,160
hacker history this is our community and

905
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
our industry's history

906
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,200
um

907
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,760
the perhaps the first and most classic

908
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
and arguably is the best but i i'll tell

909
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,520
you why my movie uh favorite movie is

910
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,920
sneakers in a moment but this movie came

911
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,720
out

912
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,040
in the early 80s 1980s so almost 40

913
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,320
years ago

914
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,839
and it was a a tale of

915
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,440
at the end of the day artificial

916
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
intelligence and machine learning and

917
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,680
the potential of what could go wrong

918
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,320
but it showed the early days of hacking

919
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,359
which was uh over phone lines and it was

920
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,599
very slow and there wasn't a whole lot

921
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,560
of

922
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,119
graphics it was all very textual

923
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,880
i don't want to give a spoiler but

924
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,920
that's war games early 80s

925
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,079
uh the next movie uh that sort of uh a

926
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,000
classic hacker movie is a movie called

927
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
sneakers if you work in the

928
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,359
as a as a penetration tester red team or

929
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,040
do any type of testing for other

930
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,240
companies

931
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,400
this movie is the model essentially for

932
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
the methodology that you follow

933
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,839
this movie came out in the early 1990s

934
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,680
there is also a classic line in this

935
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,640
movie

936
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,160
um that and i i don't have it memorized

937
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
even after all these years but basically

938
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
it says

939
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
it's all about the information you know

940
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,599
there's there's a war being waged and

941
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,359
it's not with missiles and guns and

942
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,560
bullets it's all about data i think you

943
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
know that that is prescient and i think

944
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,920
it holds true today

945
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,560
and of course the third movie which is

946
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,400
called hackers came out in 1995

947
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,440
so all these movies are old um

948
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,640
it

949
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,920
in my opinion um and this is where paul

950
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,880
and i diverge it's it's the movie that

951
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,160
introduced uh hacker culture the idea

952
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,280
that you're

953
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,640
um

954
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,000
you know you're you're

955
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,720
a community you're a tribe you're a pot

956
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,640
of people that kind of know what's going

957
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,599
on and are out to

958
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,079
defeat evil defeat the man defeat the

959
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,720
organized government defeat big brother

960
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,960
have fun do cool things know all about

961
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,359
this cool new technology

962
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,599
i encourage you to watch these movies

963
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,280
um

964
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
hackers of course do have an image

965
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,599
problem uh and

966
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,079
i i also went out to do a search of like

967
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
okay who are the world's best hackers

968
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,160
who are the most famous hackers there's

969
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
thousands of lists out there some some

970
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,920
names show up a lot but a lot of

971
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,599
disagreement uh most of the lists again

972
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,119
are

973
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,400
white guys

974
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
but there are other lists that have

975
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,599
women on the list and again hack most of

976
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,400
these lists the best famous

977
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,440
hackers

978
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,839
are all

979
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,440
i shouldn't call them bad guys or good

980
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,640
guys but they're all people that have

981
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,280
been arrested prosecuted

982
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
perhaps have served to jail time and of

983
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,680
course maybe you've reformed and

984
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,440
turned to the side of good

985
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,640
um

986
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
i'll let you be the judge

987
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,960
uh but you know there is an image

988
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,240
problem i think most people

989
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,560
acknowledgement not acknowledge this i'm

990
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
sure you guys have all seen some sorts

991
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,079
of of media representation this classic

992
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,200
hooded

993
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,800
uh faceless dark ominous

994
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,040
hacker person and this is one of those

995
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
images that i think the that we're

996
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,880
trying to dispel

997
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
um

998
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,640
i can go on and on and on my question

999
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,000
simply is

1000
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,160
and i ask this of myself

1001
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,359
um

1002
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,000
you know how many black hoodies

1003
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,440
is too many to have uh i have probably

1004
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,359
about a dozen of them

1005
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,240
um

1006
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,280
anyway

1007
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,560
uh

1008
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,640
i want to shift gears a little bit and

1009
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,720
and and sort of get into the essence of

1010
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,119
the talk and and the essence of the talk

1011
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,359
is hackers are neither created nor

1012
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,839
destroyed i believe and i could be right

1013
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,440
or wrong and i'm happy to be proven

1014
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,359
wrong but i kind of believe that you're

1015
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,920
either a hacker or you're not

1016
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,400
and i know this because i'm a hacker and

1017
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,160
i want to qualify that uh i i often

1018
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,480
forget my own advice which is don't

1019
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,760
assume that people know what you're

1020
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,400
talking about when i say i'm a hacker

1021
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,640
i'm talking about a mentality a

1022
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,079
lifestyle almost a world view an

1023
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,280
approach to just how i see things i was

1024
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,960
a computer

1025
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,359
network security internet security

1026
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,640
hacker for many years but i have not

1027
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,200
done hands-on trying to break into

1028
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,160
systems for quite a few years i don't do

1029
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,480
computer hacking anymore but i still

1030
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,319
claim to be a hacker and i'm very

1031
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,880
comfortable in saying i'm a hacker and

1032
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,119
in fact becoming a computer hacker is

1033
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,079
what

1034
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,319
began the road of discovery to to to

1035
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,079
figure out that i am a hacker uh and and

1036
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,680
the essence of what i want to share with

1037
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,520
you for the for the remainder of our

1038
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,440
time is how we got there

1039
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,240
um

1040
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,400
you know part of me is like you know

1041
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,240
again as i was doing the research and i

1042
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
look up the actual dictionary definition

1043
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,720
of of the word hacker which is something

1044
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,240
that i like to do

1045
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,040
just in general is figure out okay at

1046
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,240
least start let's start with a

1047
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
definition before we get in into deep

1048
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,040
discussions about any kind of topic so

1049
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
when i first looked it up i'm like is

1050
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,400
this really something we want to discuss

1051
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,480
but don't worry there's more to the

1052
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,560
definitions and you'll see even in

1053
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,680
dictionaries that there's a definition

1054
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,839
of hacker that represents the good and

1055
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,839
there's a definition of hacker that

1056
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,880
represents the bad

1057
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,040
so

1058
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,319
in order to be to properly frame this i

1059
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,680
i want to use myself as as an example

1060
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,839
and uh you know sort of talk to you

1061
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,440
about how i

1062
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,800
figured out that i'm a hacker um and and

1063
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,440
figured out more importantly

1064
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,880
uh how to how do you how to use my

1065
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,960
mindset in the

1066
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,359
particular peculiar way that i see the

1067
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,240
world to to do something

1068
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,000
hopefully that's positive in terms of

1069
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the the whole industry and helping

1070
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,079
companies be more secure and so and so

1071
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,839
forth

1072
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,170
so um

1073
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,680
[Music]

1074
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,520
my origin story

1075
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,319
uh which is me attempting to answer the

1076
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,560
question a little bit more in detail how

1077
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,240
did i get my start in information

1078
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,079
security or cyber security how did it

1079
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,839
how did i become a hacker how do i know

1080
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,240
that i'm a hacker

1081
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,000
you know i mentioned of course that i

1082
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,599
usually just say i started at the

1083
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,960
national security agency

1084
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,800
i

1085
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
want to walk through the process though

1086
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,760
because it i it occurred to me

1087
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,680
how did i get my start in the industry

1088
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,960
how did i become this is is really the

1089
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,359
question is how did i get to nsa

1090
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,119
and and that's what i want to focus on

1091
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,200
for a few minutes here

1092
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,040
when i first started at the national

1093
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,480
security agency which was back in 1986

1094
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,119
35 years ago

1095
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,480
nsa was going through a hiring spree

1096
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,720
what they were looking for first and

1097
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
foremost and primarily were what they

1098
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
called the critical skills of computer

1099
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,640
science mathematics and engineering um

1100
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,319
you can loosely think of this in terms

1101
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,920
of things that we're familiar with today

1102
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,359
so stem

1103
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,119
we didn't call it stem back then we

1104
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,839
called it critical skills if you had a

1105
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,040
degree in any of these disciplines you

1106
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,640
were offered a job at nsa if you were in

1107
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
in school

1108
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,480
studying these you know nsa would show

1109
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,040
up at job fairs nsa did crude recruiting

1110
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,000
from college campus campuses

1111
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
if you got the degree you were hired

1112
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,280
they

1113
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,560
did this

1114
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,440
you know

1115
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,200
they hired thousands of people this way

1116
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,760
i went to work at nsa i was neither of

1117
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,720
these

1118
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,800
i'm still neither none of none of these

1119
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,720
disciplines i actually have a business

1120
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,599
degree

1121
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,640
um

1122
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,040
so i had to go a different route and

1123
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,440
this is what i want to focus in on

1124
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,119
i'm going to talk to you kind of about

1125
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,640
how i got there

1126
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
and and what i want you guys to think

1127
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,280
about is because i'm thinking about it

1128
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,160
is

1129
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,359
how did nsa know that that i would

1130
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,319
succeed and and be able to do the job in

1131
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,359
nsa

1132
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,240
um i had to apply i had to fill out an

1133
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,960
application mail it in the mail um

1134
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,040
provide them all all of my information

1135
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,800
college transcripts and stuff but

1136
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,880
ultimately i was invited onto the campus

1137
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,280
fort meade

1138
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,000
for a couple days worth of skills tests

1139
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,920
aptitude tests i had to have a physical

1140
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
a psych exam how i passed that i don't

1141
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,200
know

1142
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,359
so on and so forth all i knew at the

1143
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,040
time was nsa likes to hire

1144
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,160
people

1145
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,240
uh who had liberal arts degrees and i

1146
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,160
happened to go to a liberal arts college

1147
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,079
so i think that happened you know that

1148
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,599
was in my favor

1149
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,800
um i also knew or came to know that uh

1150
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,400
you know they want people with

1151
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,160
you know uh

1152
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
clean wreckers or you know people that

1153
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,960
were trustworthy

1154
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,640
that uh

1155
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,400
you know back in you know i think 30

1156
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,760
years ago

1157
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,520
it was a major issue for hiring

1158
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,960
if you did any kind of drugs

1159
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
you know had alcohol problems gambling

1160
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,920
problems

1161
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,680
cheated on your spouse girlfriend uh had

1162
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,000
alternate lifestyles any of those types

1163
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,319
of things were issues um

1164
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,680
now nsa

1165
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,280
when i went through the hiring process

1166
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,200
they wanted you know they hook you up to

1167
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,800
a polygraph machine and they wanted to

1168
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
know all your dirty little secrets

1169
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
not so much to preclude you from

1170
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,800
employment although that happened but

1171
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,800
also to make sure that um

1172
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,480
they knew what your secrets were so you

1173
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,920
couldn't be blackmailed because there

1174
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,160
had been espionage cases this is back in

1175
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,760
the days of the soviet union and the

1176
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
cold war where people were compromised

1177
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,800
and and and committed treason

1178
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
uh you know u.s citizens by being

1179
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,280
blackmailed you know so that

1180
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200
it wouldn't come out that they were

1181
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,880
cheating on their spouse or more

1182
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,079
importantly it wouldn't come out that

1183
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,920
they were homosexual

1184
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,319
you may remember uh the inventor of the

1185
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,160
computer the one that broke the the

1186
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,240
enigma machine in world world war ii

1187
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,599
alan turing

1188
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,480
uh you know he was homosexual and it was

1189
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,920
a time when it was illegal and he

1190
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,760
actually you know

1191
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,160
you know the story we've come a long way

1192
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
and uh unfortunately and still have

1193
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,680
further to go

1194
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,440
but um

1195
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,960
the you know so that's some of the

1196
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,359
background stuff the the tests that i

1197
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,880
had to take the two days worth of

1198
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,160
aptitude tests um i i wish i remembered

1199
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
all of them uh and i wish i could

1200
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,920
display all of them the one that i

1201
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,640
remember the most is they gave you a

1202
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
picture a geographic you know

1203
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,760
two-dimensional drawing of a

1204
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,839
three-dimensional object and they would

1205
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,160
ask you what does this look like from

1206
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,240
behind what does this look like from the

1207
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,000
right or the left and then they give you

1208
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,839
you know other pictures and options and

1209
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,520
you're supposed to identify

1210
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,839
what it is that people what it what what

1211
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,760
the object looked like from the from the

1212
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,560
various perspectives um i found that

1213
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,200
easy apparently not everybody can do it

1214
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,560
other other tests were they gave you a

1215
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
made-up language a language that didn't

1216
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,240
exist

1217
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,480
it was just gobbledygook but they asked

1218
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,359
you

1219
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,520
it had structure and they asked you if

1220
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,440
could you identify the structure can you

1221
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,040
figure out what the nouns are can you

1222
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,040
figure out what the verbs are and all

1223
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,720
the other parts of speech

1224
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,480
another

1225
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,400
test was

1226
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
they gave you samples of collection

1227
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,800
traffic now back in those days the the

1228
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,480
information that was collected was

1229
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,400
mostly out of the air it was radio

1230
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,760
signals

1231
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,839
ironically very similar to network

1232
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,920
traffic in terms of the signals would

1233
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,960
have

1234
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,720
you know essentially header information

1235
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,040
there's to and from and time stamps you

1236
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,200
know source and destination things like

1237
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,000
that

1238
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,160
very similar so you know to try to give

1239
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,240
you a picture of what i'm talking about

1240
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,280
they

1241
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,079
uh

1242
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,599
they would give you all this traffic and

1243
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,359
they would ask you questions like can

1244
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,280
you figure out who's in charge you know

1245
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,760
is is there an address that

1246
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,640
uh messages are originating from more

1247
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,319
than other can you figure out the chain

1248
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,240
of command these were these these were

1249
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,680
messages that were

1250
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,520
you know going from governments to

1251
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,599
armies to

1252
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,280
battalions to various levels of you know

1253
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,800
leadership and authority within a

1254
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,160
military organization so they ask you to

1255
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,000
try to figure out what the structure was

1256
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,079
what kind of information could you get

1257
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,240
get from it nsa calls that traffic

1258
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,760
analysis what kind of useful information

1259
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,599
can you get from that you know stuff

1260
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,839
that we still do today with network

1261
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,000
traffic but we call it different things

1262
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
but in essence it's the same kind of

1263
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,400
stuff that nsa had been doing for years

1264
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,520
and years

1265
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,240
um

1266
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,040
what impresses me and this is an ongoing

1267
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,440
sort of research project that i'm doing

1268
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,079
is the fascination that

1269
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,000
um nsa knew how to find someone like me

1270
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
and i i gave a very condensed version of

1271
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,200
this talk a couple days ago

1272
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,960
uh for another group in north carolina

1273
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,240
which i'll i'll i'll talk about uh later

1274
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,040
on

1275
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,440
uh but it sort of clicked in my head at

1276
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,720
that point

1277
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,760
um

1278
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,599
and this is a message that i think a lot

1279
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,160
of us especially the ones of us that are

1280
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,960
hackers or identify as hackers i think

1281
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,040
i think will resonate with you

1282
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,480
um

1283
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,040
given today's standards given nsa

1284
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,520
standards back then looking for people

1285
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,000
that had a certain pedigree

1286
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,079
to put it in today's terms looking for

1287
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,359
people

1288
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,520
to hire into this industry that have

1289
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
certain certifications

1290
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,599
that have a degree

1291
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,640
in a certain field of expertise

1292
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,440
or

1293
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,960
a field

1294
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,200
to have training of some sort

1295
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,280
uh you know those are the common sort of

1296
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,520
barriers of interest entry into into our

1297
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,680
business these days

1298
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
back then it was these three critical

1299
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,880
skills

1300
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,319
um nsa figured out a way to identify me

1301
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,079
and find me i didn't even know what i

1302
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,559
was capable of they probably had no idea

1303
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,559
what i was capable of but they knew what

1304
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,400
the indicators were and that's the

1305
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,920
essence of what i'm trying to get at

1306
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,240
today and what i'm i'm curious to keep

1307
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,520
discovering and researching and and and

1308
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,839
i encourage you to think about it too

1309
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,119
and and feel free to to contribute and

1310
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,040
and let's talk about it but what are the

1311
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,480
things that

1312
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,359
uh

1313
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,720
nsa

1314
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,960
knew to look for that would identify the

1315
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,200
potential in someone like me because

1316
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,720
quite frankly

1317
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,599
i

1318
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,520
didn't qualify

1319
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,480
with their standard criteria a way a lot

1320
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,880
of people today i think

1321
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,760
don't qualify to get into this field

1322
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,920
because they don't fit the

1323
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,119
the

1324
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,839
popular

1325
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,359
criteria uh for you know what is the

1326
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,680
minimum that you need to get into and

1327
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,760
that's obviously a topic that's that's

1328
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,760
been very heated

1329
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,760
and ongoing for

1330
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,920
probably many years but we had nothing

1331
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,680
to talk about the last couple years

1332
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,359
since we're all locked down but you know

1333
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,359
this is stuff that we've talked about on

1334
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,079
uh the main show of the podcast my show

1335
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,160
the podcast when i have had

1336
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,400
conversations in the past in in real

1337
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,640
time it's you know how to how do i get

1338
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,960
into the field how do i you know

1339
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,440
re-engineer myself change you know

1340
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
change uh

1341
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,599
uh professions and and and sort of start

1342
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,200
over and get into this field you know

1343
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,800
there's all sorts of variations to

1344
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,599
discussion what i'm ultimately getting

1345
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,319
at and want to plant a seed in in

1346
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,119
everyone's head to think about is

1347
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,319
what are the identifiers that make

1348
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,359
us

1349
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,319
uh

1350
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,040
recognize someone's potential for being

1351
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,400
successful

1352
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,480
in this in this field whether it's to be

1353
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,040
a hacker or to learn hacking skills be a

1354
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,079
red tester red test red teamer or a pen

1355
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,480
tester but of course again there's so

1356
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,319
many different things in in this field

1357
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,599
that you can do

1358
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,680
how do you f how do how do we identify

1359
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,800
the things

1360
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,280
that uh

1361
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,880
make it more likely that somebody's

1362
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,440
gonna be successful and and be able to

1363
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,359
have a career in this field and be good

1364
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,880
at what they do

1365
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,760
um

1366
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,480
the nsa scores of the test and you can

1367
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,440
barely see it here but my scores are

1368
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,160
very faint but you can see hopefully

1369
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,400
there are mostly sevens eights and nines

1370
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,839
i had one six i actually uh i still have

1371
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:18,720
this

1372
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,920
i have about a 12 or 15 page document

1373
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,480
that basically lists every job code that

1374
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,040
was available at nsa at the time

1375
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,319
and

1376
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,720
it shows the minimum score on on which

1377
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,640
particular test that you have that you

1378
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,800
needed to get to qualify and you can see

1379
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,640
here just from this little snippet

1380
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,319
they're mostly looking for fours and

1381
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,240
fives to get people qualified where i

1382
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,240
was in the seven eight and nine range so

1383
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,839
i basically scored off the charts

1384
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,160
um you know again briefly

1385
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,359
uh to just to highlight okay i i wasn't

1386
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,319
those critical skills but in my 10 years

1387
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,559
at nsa here's some of the things that

1388
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,200
i've done i taught i give talks this is

1389
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,480
the name of the talks where i go into

1390
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,240
more detail and tell more tell more

1391
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,119
stories but you know just very quickly i

1392
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,800
invented something that had never been

1393
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,440
done before i fielded what i believe is

1394
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
the first software-based crypto system

1395
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,760
that nsa ever produced

1396
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,359
they weren't happy about it because they

1397
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,680
were an engineering build a little black

1398
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,400
box but i essentially i had to hack the

1399
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,200
system i had to rewrite rules that were

1400
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,480
written for

1401
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,040
producing secure hardware and figure out

1402
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,200
how what made sense and apply it to how

1403
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,440
do we produce secure software and a

1404
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,319
secure application um i'm not saying i

1405
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,000
would ever repeat this and i'm not

1406
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,920
saying it would be secure in any way

1407
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,760
shape or form by today's standards

1408
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,280
because that computer wasn't plugged

1409
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,480
into a network

1410
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,920
but at the time

1411
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,880
it was fulfilling a need from a customer

1412
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,280
and and it made sense to me why not use

1413
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,800
a computer to speed up a a an intensely

1414
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,359
manual process that would take hours to

1415
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,200
do sometimes which is manually

1416
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,839
encrypting and decrypting a one-time pad

1417
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,480
uh i mentioned earlier the wheel that i

1418
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,480
invented for special forces which they

1419
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,880
ended up using as near as i can tell

1420
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,760
for 10 or 12 years

1421
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,280
[Music]

1422
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,640
and of course

1423
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,319
you know i go on in a different talk

1424
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,839
more tales from the crypt and tell the

1425
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,640
origin story of the first pentest team

1426
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,000
there's a book that came out a couple

1427
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,319
years ago called dark territory there's

1428
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,119
a chapter in that book that has a

1429
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,839
a a paragraph that talks about

1430
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,000
um you know the nsa

1431
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,920
red team working out of a super secret

1432
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,839
dark chamber called the pit i was

1433
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:34,800
actually

1434
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,160
uh

1435
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,640
part of the team and we called our

1436
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,079
office the pit but we sort of

1437
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,079
collectively came to know our call

1438
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,480
ourselves the pit um but we're we're

1439
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,480
famous we're in a book so obviously

1440
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,520
whatever we did had lasting impact

1441
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,880
um

1442
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,599
meanwhile the all the people that were

1443
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,839
highly qualified the critical skills

1444
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,079
what they typically did at nsa was they

1445
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,760
came in and they got paid more right out

1446
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,799
of the gate sometimes 30 40 more than

1447
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,799
just p on me on the regular pay scale

1448
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,200
was paying they immediately got into a

1449
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,119
2020 program where they could go to

1450
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,440
school and pursue the graduate degree

1451
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,079
and only work part-time half-time school

1452
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,559
20 hour school 20 hours of work they

1453
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,319
were first in line for promotions

1454
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,400
because nsa wanted to keep them they are

1455
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
first in line for the training

1456
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,520
opportunities for the diversity

1457
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,240
opportunities which is touring different

1458
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,640
offices within nsa that did different

1459
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,720
things to be exposed to get you know

1460
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,400
sort of a liberal arts kind of thing

1461
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
expose themselves to everything they

1462
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,559
would get their master's degree and two

1463
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,079
months later they'd leave for private

1464
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,920
industry where they got an even better

1465
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,119
paying job

1466
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,240
that

1467
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,160
with exceptions that was very much the

1468
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,280
model

1469
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,359
they discovered me

1470
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,839
however they did i did some meaningful

1471
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,559
tangible things uh all the people that

1472
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,440
they thought were highly qualified uh

1473
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,280
they threw money at them an opportunity

1474
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,280
at them and they left anyway

1475
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,440
uh and i'm am i bitter about it perhaps

1476
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,480
um

1477
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,599
but

1478
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,119
you know so that that's sort of the

1479
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,440
origin story which i provide is context

1480
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,599
i yeah i didn't go into nsa thinking i

1481
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,319
was a hacker or even you know using that

1482
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,240
word in my vocabulary that obviously

1483
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,559
came later when i got into the red red

1484
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,680
teeming pen testing thing but i you know

1485
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
again i'm trying to think about okay how

1486
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,599
do i know i'm a hacker what is it about

1487
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,720
me that identifies the potential or the

1488
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,160
skill set of being a hacker i i want to

1489
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,319
use myself as an example

1490
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,680
and and this is where it would be

1491
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,839
ordinarily audience participation so

1492
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,319
you'll just have to play along you know

1493
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,280
silently wherever you are

1494
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,480
but

1495
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,920
you know what i would ask if it was a

1496
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,079
live audience is you know show of hands

1497
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,119
who else is like this and the nuance is

1498
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,359
and there's overlap is i'm not just

1499
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,880
looking for things that are sort of

1500
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,359
character traits or identifiers like oh

1501
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,000
that person's a hacker uh but the things

1502
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,480
that are the sort of innate about your

1503
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,559
being your the way you think the way you

1504
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,200
approach things that are indicators that

1505
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,760
oh you might have that

1506
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,559
that hacker mindset if you will

1507
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,799
so uh you know again i did a little bit

1508
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,839
of a research online you know because

1509
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,319
i'm quite sure that any idea that i have

1510
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,640
or anything that i want to pursue

1511
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,240
probably 100 other people have done it

1512
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,559
before me and have done a better job

1513
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,319
organizing it i found this one

1514
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,520
particular

1515
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,200
uh article

1516
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,079
uh that i thought was kind of cool um

1517
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,599
you know if you have a chance go back on

1518
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,319
the

1519
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,559
replay and find this article it's pretty

1520
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,240
interesting but yeah this is kind of

1521
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,079
interesting stuff but again these are

1522
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,160
sort of uh you know it's the it's the

1523
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,559
reverse of course but you know signs

1524
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,799
that you would make a lousy hacker don't

1525
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,280
do this make a good hacker

1526
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,000
but

1527
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,559
uh all that aside these are the next

1528
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,240
several slides or these are the things

1529
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,799
that are unique about me that looking

1530
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,520
back on it self-reflection i think these

1531
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,680
are indicators that a

1532
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,160
i'm a hacker but b these are probably

1533
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,400
indicators that you know

1534
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,040
helped me get in the door at nsa helped

1535
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,359
me be able to score well on those tests

1536
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,280
i don't think this is an exhaustive or

1537
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,079
exclusive list and i am genuinely

1538
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,760
interested in hearing other people's

1539
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,040
ideas

1540
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,440
maybe drop it into into the discord

1541
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,960
server in the chat

1542
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,240
um

1543
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,119
but you know what are the what are the

1544
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,760
signs and indicators that someone might

1545
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,640
have the potential or the aptitude for

1546
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,680
doing well in this field so i grew up

1547
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,920
doing puzzles i uh i was in a puzzle

1548
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,079
solving family we used to get these

1549
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,760
things called dell crossroad puzzle

1550
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,920
magazines in these in these books there

1551
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,839
were of course crossroad puzzles which

1552
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,920
hopefully you've heard of but there's

1553
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,520
other types of puzzles and these are the

1554
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,280
ones that i like to do them

1555
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,880
more often than just the normal

1556
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,119
crossword something called a diagram

1557
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,200
list which is a crossword puzzle but not

1558
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,880
only do you have to solve the clues and

1559
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,119
get the words you have to figure out the

1560
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,920
grid a little bit higher level of

1561
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,760
difficulty but a fun puzzle um i i

1562
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,240
actually did the crypto quizzes where

1563
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,480
uh you'd have to guess words and the

1564
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,720
letters would pop into the grid and

1565
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,000
eventually you would have a a a a quote

1566
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,440
or a phrase

1567
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,440
and you could actually work it both ways

1568
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,240
as you started to get more letters in a

1569
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,799
word in the grid you might recognize the

1570
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,559
word which would give you more letters

1571
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,720
to go back over to the

1572
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,280
uh the questions of uh you know the

1573
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,799
specific words that you're trying to

1574
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,119
guess similar to a crossword puzzle

1575
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,119
um

1576
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,040
you know these are all caesar ciphers in

1577
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,720
fact these were in the puzzle magazines

1578
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
they they used to be in the funny pages

1579
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,799
the comics pages of newspapers the ones

1580
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,040
that i grew up with you know so i was

1581
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,599
doing cryptography long before i ever

1582
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,240
did it for a living uh but the most

1583
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,599
important one

1584
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,520
uh type of puzzle that i used to like to

1585
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,839
do was something called a logic problem

1586
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,040
and in

1587
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,839
in a in a karma type of twist of fate

1588
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,160
when i first started at nsa

1589
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,520
in this

1590
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,599
cryptic cryptographic organization where

1591
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,359
i did the software and i did the whiz

1592
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,200
wheel i had a mentor and the mentor was

1593
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,920
a cryptologist that had been in

1594
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,880
at nsa for 15 or 20 years already he

1595
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,200
taught me a lot he really i i would

1596
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,880
credit him everybody should have a

1597
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
mentor that you can credit is

1598
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,799
putting you on the path to

1599
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,200
having you know a successful rewarding

1600
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,720
career for me it's job satisfaction um

1601
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,559
the the twist of fate is this this

1602
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,640
person that was my mentor as it turned

1603
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,079
out used to as a side job as a hobby

1604
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,240
write logic problems for these dell

1605
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,160
crossword puzzle magazines so i used to

1606
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,640
do puzzles that he would write and then

1607
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,559
i ended up working with him and he

1608
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,280
became my mentor

1609
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,040
i'm left handed i

1610
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,160
i feel like in this industry uh there

1611
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,119
are more left-handed people than than

1612
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,559
you know the national average the

1613
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,000
worldwide average of how many

1614
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
left-handed people there are

1615
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,440
um

1616
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,280
if you're left-handed hopefully you'll

1617
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,359
understand the difficulties that we face

1618
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,280
you right-handed people don't have to

1619
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,480
listen right now because you don't

1620
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,799
understand but we live in a world where

1621
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,720
everything is right-handed and when

1622
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,559
you're left-handed that means things are

1623
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,839
backwards

1624
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,480
i am still scarred for my first day of

1625
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,319
first grade in elementary school where

1626
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,119
back in those days this was the 1960s

1627
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,040
the schools would give you supplies

1628
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,640
they'd give you a little box and you get

1629
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,520
pens and pencils and rulers and the most

1630
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,000
coveted item was a pair of scissors and

1631
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,680
everybody else got these little shiny

1632
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,799
pointy scissors i got these rounded

1633
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,240
blunt-edged loose dull scissors and it

1634
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,680
always kind of bothered me like why

1635
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,200
can't i have the pointy scissors i'm

1636
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,040
left-handed i'm gonna put my eye out um

1637
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,559
i still have issues

1638
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,760
uh

1639
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,240
i i very often feel like i don't fit in

1640
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,839
with a crowd i always feel like an

1641
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,240
outsider i think part of it is because

1642
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,400
going through especially junior and

1643
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,480
senior high school and even college

1644
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,400
if there's a left-handed desk in the

1645
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,440
classroom it tends to be pushed back in

1646
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,680
the back row off to the corner so to

1647
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,039
this day if i go into an auditorium or a

1648
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,039
convention center or you want to attend

1649
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,359
a talk at a conference i tend to like to

1650
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,280
sit in the back left corner i don't know

1651
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,520
why it is but that's the way it is

1652
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,640
um i've got trust issues i've got lots

1653
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,200
of issues if you have issues

1654
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,640
you're either

1655
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,280
a normal human uh or maybe it's an

1656
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,400
indicator

1657
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,240
um

1658
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,160
i this is where i'm trying to put myself

1659
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,559
out there a little bit i count things uh

1660
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,480
i don't tell people that a lot but i'm

1661
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,160
putting it out there

1662
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,839
pretty much every set of stairs that i

1663
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,760
ever go up and down i'm always counting

1664
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,000
the stairs if i'm driving out on the

1665
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,160
highway i'm i'm counting the dotted

1666
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,559
lines you know between intersections or

1667
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,839
from some arbitrary point a to point b

1668
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,280
um i i i would ask you the question i

1669
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,799
have to give you the punch line but you

1670
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,880
know

1671
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,880
these are sort of depictions i think of

1672
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,119
people that might be uh on the spectrum

1673
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,160
at some point they might be adhd they

1674
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,680
might be cdo which by the way is ocd but

1675
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,160
in alphabetical order um

1676
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,559
there tends to be a lot of people in our

1677
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,280
our our industry that that have these

1678
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,319
kind of

1679
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,200
you know what society says or

1680
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,640
abnormalities but they actually make us

1681
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,400
really really good at doing the things

1682
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,000
that we need to be good at you know the

1683
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,640
ability to see things and analyze things

1684
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,960
and you know are com i'm not just saying

1685
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,960
it's me necessarily i see this in others

1686
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,319
but just brilliant people that are just

1687
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,319
for whatever reason sort of socially

1688
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,280
awkward

1689
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,079
and you might have picked up on on on it

1690
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,839
especially talking about the nsa

1691
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,839
experience i might have some anger

1692
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:57,440
issues uh other random things like uh

1693
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,960
i'm one of the types of people that

1694
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,559
actually take the tags off of the

1695
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,799
furniture even though it's illegal

1696
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:03,839
um

1697
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,440
i happen to be from a musical family i i

1698
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,160
attempt to play guitar that's that's me

1699
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,160
i think when i was four years old when

1700
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,880
somebody gave me my first little ukulele

1701
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,720
clearly i'm left-handed

1702
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,200
um i don't have a good depiction for it

1703
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,000
but for some reason i can see what's

1704
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,799
wrong with things uh you know i'll watch

1705
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,240
somebody give a conference talk and i'll

1706
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,000
see a typo in their slide or they'll use

1707
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,599
the wrong word or

1708
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,559
or

1709
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,319
you know it's made me good as a as a

1710
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,160
consultant going in trying to find

1711
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,599
whether companies are doing the right

1712
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,920
things or not i for some reason i can

1713
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,720
see

1714
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,000
the wrong the logic error very often

1715
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,119
and

1716
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,280
you know as an example

1717
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,280
this slide bugs me because i don't have

1718
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,440
an example i don't have a graphical

1719
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,599
example to depict this it kind of bugs

1720
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:52,960
me

1721
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,960
little odd things like you know being

1722
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,799
able to see the world not necessarily

1723
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,160
for what it is

1724
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,240
you know most people know that joke

1725
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,240
um but that's where i invite you that's

1726
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,480
just me that's just a glimpse of me you

1727
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,520
know

1728
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,359
what are your experiences what do you

1729
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,079
see as indicators not just again not

1730
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,760
just the character traits or the

1731
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,319
identifiers from a oh they're a hacker

1732
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,160
but what makes it

1733
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
what makes you

1734
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,440
or others

1735
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,319
uh

1736
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,319
likely to have be good at have the

1737
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,319
potential for success

1738
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,319
at being a hacker at being a cyber

1739
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,079
security professional

1740
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,839
um

1741
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,760
i mentioned earlier that i've given a a

1742
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,920
brief uh version of this talk earlier

1743
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,280
this week i was actually down in

1744
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,200
asheville north carolina

1745
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,760
i was invited by the carolina cyber

1746
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,319
center which is uh operating out of

1747
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,079
montreal college they've joined an

1748
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,599
organization

1749
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,319
uh it's it's an you know

1750
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,480
i'm only glimpsing and beginning to

1751
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,720
understand but i'm sharing this because

1752
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,480
this is an opportunity for you guys in

1753
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,400
north carolina they they're part of

1754
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,240
something called the carolina cyber

1755
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,440
network so if you're someone that's uh

1756
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,799
you know if you're listening today it's

1757
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,240
because you're you want to learn if

1758
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,240
you're participating in b-sides you

1759
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,720
consider yourself a student if you

1760
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,240
happen to be an actual you know like

1761
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,000
college student or even a high school

1762
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
student looking to get into college and

1763
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,160
you live in north carolina there's this

1764
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,400
whole

1765
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,720
network of

1766
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,400
colleges and universities that have

1767
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,799
gotten together trying to figure out how

1768
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,119
to better identify people that are going

1769
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,119
to succeed in this career but give them

1770
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,200
the right types of education so they can

1771
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
actually go out and have jobs in this

1772
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,359
career so just a a quick acknowledgement

1773
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,359
especially since this is essentially a

1774
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,599
local resource for you guys

1775
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,599
uh you know in the state of north

1776
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,599
carolina

1777
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,640
so you know my bottom line here to some

1778
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,400
degree is

1779
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,880
whether you identify as a hacker or not

1780
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,760
to me

1781
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,200
at one level it doesn't matter but

1782
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,720
that's easy for me to say i guess

1783
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,599
because

1784
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,920
i am a hacker but it's not something

1785
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,520
that is

1786
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,920
means that you

1787
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,760
it doesn't really mean anything at the

1788
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,520
end of the day you can be smart and

1789
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,920
successful and do well at your job

1790
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,000
find what it is that you're good at find

1791
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,280
it what it is that you have the

1792
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,359
potential for

1793
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,839
i want to take the last few moments to

1794
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,760
tell you a quick story

1795
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,920
um not sure if anybody knows who this

1796
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,640
person is uh if you've heard of a book

1797
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,359
that's relatively old at this point this

1798
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,680
is robert fulgum

1799
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,359
folgim i don't know how to pronounce his

1800
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,680
name he wrote a book called all i really

1801
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,000
need to know i learned in kindergarten

1802
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,319
um speaking of which uh you know just

1803
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,240
for fun here here's my actual

1804
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,480
kindergarten class the photograph was

1805
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,400
taken in 1968

1806
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,520
and in case you're wondering that's me

1807
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,920
uh but i want to take a few minutes

1808
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,359
and i know we're running short on

1809
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,359
getting close to the top of the hour but

1810
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,000
i want to read a short essay that robert

1811
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
fulgum wrote just to give you a sort of

1812
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,359
food for thought

1813
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,400
um

1814
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,799
so let me open up

1815
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,559
and tell you real quick and i apologize

1816
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,720
for reading something but i i think it's

1817
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,799
worth it for you so robert fulgham

1818
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,319
writes over the last couple of years

1819
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,079
i've been a frequent guest in schools

1820
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,160
most often invited by kindergartens and

1821
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,640
colleges the environments differ only in

1822
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,719
scale in the beginner's classroom and on

1823
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,040
university campus campuses the same

1824
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,600
opportunities and facilities exist tools

1825
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,359
for reading and writing are there words

1826
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,520
and numbers areas devoted to scientific

1827
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,040
experiment

1828
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,359
labels labs and work boxes those things

1829
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,198
are necessary for the arts paint music

1830
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,279
costumes rooms to dance so on and so

1831
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,880
forth

1832
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,479
in kindergarten

1833
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,640
the resources are in one room with

1834
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,120
access for all in college the resources

1835
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,799
are in separate buildings with limited

1836
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,960
availability but the most apparent

1837
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,040
difference is in the self-image of the

1838
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,080
students

1839
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,000
ask a kindergarten class how many of you

1840
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,479
can draw all hands shoot up of course we

1841
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,560
can draw all of us what can you draw

1842
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,880
anything how about a dog eating a fire

1843
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,799
truck in a jungle sure how big do you

1844
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,279
want it how many of you can sing all

1845
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,839
hands of course we can sing what can you

1846
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,679
sing anything what if you don't know the

1847
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,920
words no problem we'll make it up let's

1848
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,799
sing now why not how many of you dance

1849
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,040
unanimous again what kind of music do

1850

1852
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,759

1853
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,679
do you like to act in plays yes do you

1854
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,439
play musical instruments yes do you

1855
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,759
write poetry yes can you read and write

1856
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,359
and count yes we're learning all that

1857
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,479
stuff now their answer is yes over and

1858
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,479
over again yes the children are

1859
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,080
confident in spirit

1860
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,439
infinite in resources and eager to learn

1861
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,439
everything is still possible

1862
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,279
try those same questions on a college

1863
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,880
audience a small percentage of the

1864
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,560
students will raise their hands when

1865
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,399
asked if they can draw or dance or sing

1866
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,640
or paint or act or play an instrument

1867
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,479
not infrequently those who do raise

1868
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,560
their hands will want to qualify their

1869
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,880
response with their limitations well i

1870
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,080
only play piano i only draw horses i

1871
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,239
only dance to rock and roll i only sing

1872
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,159
in the shower when asked why the

1873
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,239
limitations college students answer they

1874
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,480
do not have talent are not majoring in

1875
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,719
the subject or have not done any of

1876
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,040
those things since about the third grade

1877
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,920
or worse they're embarrassed for others

1878
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,320
to see them sing or dance or act you can

1879
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,840
imagine the response to the same

1880
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,719
questions asked of an older audience the

1881
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,280
answer no none of the above so the

1882
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,440
question robert fulgam asks is what went

1883
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,159
wrong between kindergarten and college

1884
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,760
what happened to yes

1885
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,280
of course i can

1886
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,440
so my question

1887
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,560
to you

1888
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,040
and my encouragement to you as as our

1889
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,880
time wraps up is

1890
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,000
uh

1891
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,760
you know what happened between when you

1892
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,440
were kindergartner and where you are

1893
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,840
today because this is true of all of us

1894
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,920
where do we build in our limitations and

1895
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,080
i want to encourage you to to remember

1896
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,719
especially as you pursue your learning

1897
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,640
and further your career in cyber

1898
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,719
security and hacking and pen testing and

1899
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,400
wood pen testing whatever it is that

1900
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,520
you're doing

1901
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,880
um

1902
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,920
you know realize you are

1903
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,560
capable of doing anything anybody can do

1904
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,560
this but i think the important point is

1905
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,080
i give you a couple sort of parting

1906
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,400
thoughts here the important thing more

1907
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,120
than trying to get to a particular place

1908
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,120
is to find out that place where you're

1909
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,280
best suited to be find out what your

1910
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,840
potential is learn how to recognize the

1911
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,239
potential in yourself and others the

1912
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,560
things that are indicators that are that

1913
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,120
will make you right for the job and and

1914
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,760
my my wish for everyone

1915
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,280
and this is something i say to people

1916
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,640
again in the former times that have

1917
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,400
approached me how do i get into this

1918
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,640
career how do i exceed or excel or

1919
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,400
advance myself is

1920
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,600
uh expose yourself to as much as you can

1921
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,640
don't limit yourself find out what it is

1922
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,960
that you are good at or have the

1923
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,800
potential or the aptitude or the

1924
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,840
interest or the curiosity for and pursue

1925
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,080
that but also find out what it is that

1926
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,440
you like to do and the sweet spot

1927
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,560
if you're lucky and i've been very lucky

1928
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,480
what you're good at and what you like to

1929
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,520
do are the same thing and and to me

1930
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,840
that's sort of the ultimate indicator of

1931
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,960
success

1932
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,840
uh

1933
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,400
but maybe i'm wrong

1934
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,239
but you know so i leave this with you

1935
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,400
enjoy the rest of your day

1936
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,320
enjoy all the talks especially the

1937
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,960
international talks that's so cool

1938
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,960
let's figure out this thing together my

1939
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,600
question in my ongoing research is what

1940
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,920
are the indicators that someone has the

1941
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,440
potential to to excel and be successful

1942
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,000
in the career of cyber security and by

1943
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,520
all means

1944
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,159
you know don't stop questioning

1945
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,560
as a way to push back but also as a way

1946
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,000
to learn

1947
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,400

1982
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,280
at some point in this field you you have

1983
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,159
to get a sense of humor somehow

1984
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,679
otherwise it

1985
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,600
uh i don't know how you would do that

1986
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,679
successfully without it would be a lot

1987
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,000
more bitter

1988
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,280
yeah there's a a saying that i got in a

1989
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,360
fortune cookie many years ago you know

1990
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,600
it's a common saying and i always i

1991
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,360
always get it mixed up because i

1992
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,840
overthink things which is

1993
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,800
one of one of those other

1994
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,320
characteristics but

1995
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,360
life

1996
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,679
is a

1997
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,640
tragedy for those who feel and a comedy

1998
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,159
for those who think

1999
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,480
or switch that one

2000
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,400
yeah that's one of those other

2001
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,719
if you can't laugh at this stuff you'll

2002
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,880
you know and unfortunately too many of

2003
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,040
us have

2004
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,280
we will uh pursue more permanent

2005
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,440
solutions to our problems which i think

2006
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,480
yeah i know of course tragic yeah

2007
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,159

01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,800
yeah yeah and and

2009
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,920

uh joining us today

2037
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,719
again thank you for letting me have the

2038
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,360
opportunity

2039
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,760
and again i encourage everyone to to

2040
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,679
think about what it is that makes me who

2041
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,640
i am whether you identify as a hacker or

2042
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,440
not

2043
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,840
and and what are the indicators so that

2044
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,800
we can

2045
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,040
fill the openings and and help the next

2046
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,159
generation

2047
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,600
you know what are what are the things to

2048
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,719
look for

2049
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,600
beyond the stem and beyond the certain

2050
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,000
certifications that we love or hate and

2051
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,400
so on and so forth because again and

2052
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,280
this was

2053
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,800
as i said it crystallized for me the

2054
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,159
other day when i gave this talk to

2055
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,360
educators

2056
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,480
i wouldn't get into your colleges today

2057
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,159
you know with the qualifications that

2058
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,760
you have i wouldn't have gotten into the

2059
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,440
college that i went to

2060
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,120
which means i wouldn't have gotten into

2061
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,840
nsa because i didn't have the the

2062
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,239
prerequisites that they were looking for

2063
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,560
so you know if for nothing else we've

2064
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,480
got a as a community we have to come up

2065
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,560
with a different set of indicators

2066
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,480
because we all know that the ones that

2067
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,320
everybody's pointing to

2068
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,800
are are not let's say not necessarily

2069
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,360
the right indicators but that means we

2070
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
got to come up with the other indicators

2071
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,760
and that's what i'm i'm pursuing and and

2072
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,320
i i hope but i have at least intrigued

2073
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,400
others to think about it and and let's

2074
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,880
let's let's pull our resources and think

2075
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,800
about and promote

2076
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,800
how do we find the talent how do we

2077
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,360
identify the skill sets for all the

2078
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,960
different things we do in this industry

2079
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,040
that's really what i'm

2080
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,880
working on in my brain

2081
