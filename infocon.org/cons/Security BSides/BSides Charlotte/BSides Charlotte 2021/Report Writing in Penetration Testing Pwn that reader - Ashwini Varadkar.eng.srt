1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,879
hello everyone today we are going to

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,640
talk about that part of penetration

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,440
testing which is as important as any of

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
its other parts for example be it

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,240
reconnaissance or exploitation

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
reporting is important but

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,000
this is something that is really less

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,680
talked about

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,439
so in this session we are going to talk

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,359
about report writing in penetration

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
testing

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
a report is a critical document

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,039
especially in penetration testing it

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,480
deals with security critical

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
observations for that matter take any

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,360
cyber security engagement be it security

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
audits be it source code reviews be it

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
compromise assist assessment engagement

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,559
the final deliverable will always be a

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,399
report

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
now summaries of these observations can

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
also be communicated verbally but then

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
complete and final report is always a

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,440
written document

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079
now we know this from our experience as

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
well have we ever

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
uh

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
see the situation where our pentest

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
observations were recorded and we have

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,559
audio stored of it no right the final

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
deliverable will always be a written

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
document and that is exactly why that

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
when we are working in a dynamic field

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
like penetration testing it is important

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,520
that

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,360
attention the relevant attention is

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,479
given

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,680
to

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,119
one of the most important phases of

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,840
penetration testing that is report right

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
so now that the stage has been set

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
let's get going

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,920
so first things first who am i

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,479
my name is ashwini varadkar and i am

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,320
working as a lead quality assurance

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,360
analyst

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,640
fondly the storyteller at not to secure

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
and if i have to summarize my journey i

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
started my career as a technical writer

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,759
and cyber security analyst

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
moving ahead to becoming a pen tester a

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
senior security analyst and then working

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
as a lead qa in cyber security

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,040
so since

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,600
i started my career as a tech writer and

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,079
i was always passionate about writing

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
my interest and my passion was also

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,759
there towards reports it was natural

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,160
because i used to love writing

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,319
so during report debriefs or while

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,080
writing pentest reports

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
if the client did not understand any

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,480
finding or be it for any other team

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
member if the client came back and they

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640
needed an explanation

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,360
i used to be curious as to why

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
did the client not understand what did

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
we miss

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
or if we have not written it correctly

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
did we understand the finding

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,599
so this curiosity

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,440
led me to explore report writing more

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
identify common mistakes come out with

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
ways in which how report writing could

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,200
be improved

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
and as a part of my

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,599
journey i paid special attention to

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
different kinds of reports in pen test

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,080
by various consultants i have an

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
experience of reviewing reports from

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
various consultants different years of

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
experiences different projects different

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
templates so in this session i am going

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
to utilize my experience and try to

85
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
and try to put forward whatever i

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
gathered during these years of

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
experience in cyber security

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
so let's get going

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,959
now since we are talking about reporting

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
in penetration testing the first thing

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
that we should understand is what is

92
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
penetration testing or the objective

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,840
now when i say penetration testing a lot

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
of people

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
think about vulnerabilities criticality

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
is shell access fine fair enough

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,599
penetration testing is a

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,920
exhilarating domain

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
but is that the objective

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
like discovering vulnerabilities

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,599
taking pocs images and then what storing

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,319
them in a folder no right do we

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,080
send across a folder to client no

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
so the actual objective is

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,360
to identify vulnerabilities

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
report confirmed and validated

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,519
vulnerabilities if remediation is part

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
of the scope write about remedial

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,360
measures and then send across this

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
report now based on the remedial

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
measures provided the client will start

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
fixing those vulnerabilities to achieve

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,439
security so the ultimate goal of

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
penetration testing is security

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
now if we map penetration testing the

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
goal of penetration testing to security

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
we automatically understand that okay

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
vulnerabilities are important but if we

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,120
cannot communicate and if we are not

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
on one page with a client in terms of

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
vulnerabilities and remedial measures

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
then there might be a gap in

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
understanding

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
so the objective of penetration testing

125
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
is security

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,280
now

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
just before the session i did a small

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,479
survey because i wanted to understand

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,320
what our fellow pen testers

130
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
what

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
fellow pentesters have to say about some

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
questions for example i just asked them

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
what is the ultimate goal of pen test

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
you can see the result here 66 percent

135
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
were correct in guessing security

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
obviously the options are a bit tricky

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
but if we have to remember

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,199
security is a main objective so then

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
automatically communication skills also

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,600
comes into the picture

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
also steps of ethical hacking now when

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
as newcomers

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,960
we started studying about security this

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
was the cycle that we were told about we

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,280
were explained about or hacking

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,840
methodology ethical hacking cycle

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
so if we see reporting is a very

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,280
important part in this entire process

149
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
now if you are a freelancer or if you

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
are doing independent pen tests

151
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
sometimes it's only from recon to this

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
and there is reports are important but

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,440
when you are in an organization

154
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
reporting is a bit different

155
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,840
there are report reviews then are report

156
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
debriefs so there is a process and there

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
is no running away so this is where

158
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
reporting stands in penetration testing

159
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
in and penetration testing engagement

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,759
and that is why we need to understand

161
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
the objective first

162
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
and then go towards how we can improve

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,479
our writing

164
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
now if you see this question do you

165
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,479
think reporting in your organization is

166
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,280
given the attention that it deserves

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
now 55 percent of people have said no

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,240
so this is quite alarming

169
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,280
now when i say attention meaning in

170
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
terms of training in terms of review in

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
terms of a person who is accountable if

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
there is any doubts related to report

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,600
writing or sentence formation etc so

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
this is something really alarming

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,319
now problem areas because we are adamant

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
in our likes and more so in our dislikes

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
see when we the first thing

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,599
towards

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,360
resolution of a problem is that we need

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
to acknowledge that a problem exists now

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,639
there is no problem per se but then

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
report writing is really a highly

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
despised task

184
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
if you ask pen testers what is that they

185
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,360
don't like

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
in this pen test

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
methodology they'll say reporting

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
because it's like it involves a lot of

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
time and you have to write and there is

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,199
nothing cool or dynamic about it

191
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
so the problem statements which i found

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
are additional tasks a lot of pen

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
testers consider report writing as an

194
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
additional task

195
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
the fact is penetration report writing

196
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
is as important as any other phase like

197
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,759
i said reconnaissance exploitation any

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
phase it is a part of pentest and when

199
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
we look at reporting when we considered

200
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
it as an important part we automatically

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
feel like investing time in it if you

202
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
think of it as an additional task you

203
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
might not want to invest time or you'll

204
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
be reluctant

205
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
when any trainings are provided when any

206
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
feedback is given

207
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,560
next accelerating domain now this is

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
important and i wanted to share

209
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,919
as a newcomer when we hear about cyber

210
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
security that we want to make a career

211
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
in cyber security we immediately think

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
of hacking then there are cyber crimes

213
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
cyber

214
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
cells etc all cool stuff

215
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
but we don't think about communication

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
skills at this stage fair enough

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,639
as a senior if i have to switch from

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,520
some domain to cyber security again i

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
will think about various certifications

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
and how i can move laterally and change

221
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
my domain right i will think about again

222
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,479
communication skills there

223
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,879
fair enough but what happens is

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,559
when they enter into this field and they

225
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
realize that almost 40 to 50 percent of

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,479
their time is going to be invested into

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
reporting

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
into amendments as per the changes that

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
are suggested in report debriefs

230
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
communication skills speaking and

231
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
writing more

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,040
so they find it really different that

233
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
okay oh god there's a lot of reporting

234
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,880
can we simply not automate the entire

235
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
reporting but we don't want to learn

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
they're reluctant there's some kind of a

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,959
reluctancy towards

238
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,480
trying to invest time in report writing

239
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
so then is communication skills more

240
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
important than the skills that are

241
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
required for ethical hacker no but then

242
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,839
balance is the key

243
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
both are equally important now if we go

244
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,800
back to this cycle

245
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,480
there's one more important thing that

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
from recon to here the skill set that is

247
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,560
required is different and if you see

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
reporting and debriefs the skill set

249
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
that is required here is different this

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,760
is communication skills and these are

251
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
our technical skill sets which are

252
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,839
required for assessments

253
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,360
so this is the thing what i mean by

254
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
skill sets that two different skill sets

255
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,839
are required when we say we are a pen

256
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,600
tester or a consultant

257
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
it is a it is a job that we are also

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
focusing on communication skills because

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
like we saw the final two stages are of

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
communication skills so these are three

261
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
problem statements that we need to

262
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,279
address and as and when we also start

263
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
preaching about communication skills

264
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
about the importance of reporting at

265
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,279
initial stages or when somebody is

266
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,200
trying to enter into this field they'll

267
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
be prepared that this is something that

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
they need to learn and gradually we'll

269
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,519
see a day that reporting will be like

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,079
everybody will be good in reports and in

271
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
speaking because they already have been

272
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,760
preparing themselves

273
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,839
gaining technical knowledge and also

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,279
working on communication skills

275
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
now the need for good report writing

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
so if you are

277
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
really good in identifying

278
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
vulnerabilities and you have found

279
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,839
critical vulnerabilities there are

280
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,480
chaining of attacks and everything but

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
if you cannot transfer this knowledge

282
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,959
correctly to the reader your knowledge

283
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
will be limited to you

284
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
so this is completely your loss because

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,399
you have studied something but you're

286
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,800
not able to put put forth your story to

287
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,279
the reader so because of this your

288
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,760
knowledge your hard work is restricted

289
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,519
to you

290
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,560
second point is good impression

291
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
now suppose you are reading a report

292
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
that has a lot of spelling mistakes

293
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
incoherent sentence is like sentences

294
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
from which any meaning cannot be derived

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,399
by seeing such reports you will doubt

296
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
the credibility of that report even

297
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
though it is technically accurate you

298
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
will still doubt for that matter

299
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440
imagine you're getting an email from a

300
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
legitimate source and there are a lot of

301
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
spelling mistakes

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
uh inconsistencies with regards to cases

303
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,160
the first thing that you will think is

304
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
is that a phishing email

305
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,079
you will right so this is a thing a bad

306
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,680
report

307
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
will affect your image your impression

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
as well so when you are investing time

309
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
in reporting it is also for your own

310
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,760
self for knowledge transfer

311
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
and also that your report is considered

312
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,480
and it is a dc and it is really recently

313
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
received by the reader

314
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
now again this is yet another alarming

315
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
thing do you personally like reporting

316
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
people don't like reporting again i

317
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
think

318
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
if we go back to the problem statements

319
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,000
that they think it is an additional task

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,560
but it's very much a part of pentest

321
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
and i'm sure gradually there will be a

322
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
change

323
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
tech writing versus content writing this

324
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,959
is one

325
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,040
beautiful thing that i learned from a

326
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
mentor

327
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
difference between tech writing and

328
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
content writing

329
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
now when it's penetration testing it

330
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,639
comes under tech writing okay

331
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
now this is some comparison that i did

332
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
on three factors only

333
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
the first factor is

334
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
style okay

335
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
so the style for technical writing will

336
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,399
be formal on technical topics

337
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,839
content writing informal on non-tech

338
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,200
topics right

339
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
the vocabulary here is professional and

340
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,440
for technical audience your general

341
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
evocative technical writing is to inform

342
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,839
instruct

343
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
content writing

344
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,839
inform

345
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,200
entertain right

346
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
so if you see technical writing sounds

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
like something very strict

348
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
official and content writing free

349
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,880
flowing poetic kind of

350
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
but if you go by this definition and if

351
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,519
you write technical writing as per these

352
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,880
points you will fail

353
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
you cannot just spit facts at readers

354
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,839
they need to be told a story

355
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
so for a good technical writing these

356
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
two points in red from content writing

357
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
needs to be embedded technical writing

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
can be emotional technical writing is

359
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,079
technical storytelling

360
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
you can entertain people via your

361
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,079
technical write-ups

362
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,000
so this is very important that technical

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
writing is really not

364
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
that strict as it sounds

365
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,560
and once you understand this that it's

366
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
all about technical storytelling keeping

367
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,040
things simple you will enjoy technical

368
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,880
writing or pentest report writing

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
now that we understand that penetration

370
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
testing can be free flowing too just we

371
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,959
need to keep some simple things in mind

372
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,279
like not to use jargons or internet

373
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,920
words keep it simple decent and then you

374
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,839
get your technical writer now let's

375
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
dissect a penetration testing report

376
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
now i have

377
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,519
divided the report into two parts of

378
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
course there are other parts in a report

379
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
like executive summary there might be

380
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,279
appendices

381
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
so the two key parts that i have

382
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,519
identified are the proof of concept and

383
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
risk rating

384
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
now the proof of concept is a key part

385
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
because this is where you talk about

386
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,040
vulnerabilities the readers will refer

387
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
to this if they have to reproduce the

388
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
attack correct

389
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
and this is one part which cannot be

390
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
automated so the real writing the real

391
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,240
storytelling happens at this section and

392
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
the other important key part is the risk

393
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,040
rating

394
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
you organize your findings as per risk

395
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
rating now be it qualitative

396
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
risk assignment or numerical scores

397
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
based on cbss or any other method that

398
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
you use

399
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,600
so risk rating will allow you to

400
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
arrange your findings and the proof of

401
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,880
concept

402
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
is the evidence that a vulnerability

403
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,839
existed when you tested that particular

404
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,440
asset and it's a proof

405
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,639
evidence

406
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
so these are the two key parts and the

407
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
other parts like description mitigation

408
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,040
now why mitigation is not in key part

409
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,800
because sometimes for pen test

410
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
engagements mitigation might not be

411
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
compulsory it depends upon the scope and

412
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
what was agreed upon

413
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
mitigation

414
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
at a high level

415
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,079
can be reused

416
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,519
even description now when i say

417
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,800
description

418
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
it is description of a vulnerability

419
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,120
mostly we write a generic description

420
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
like suppose sql injection then we talk

421
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
about sql injection we talk about in

422
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,040
lack of input validation in the

423
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
description itself

424
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,199
impact that it may it will have

425
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,759
so if you have already

426
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
written a description of sql injection

427
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
for any client

428
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,839
you may reuse that part

429
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,000
mitigation also at a high level can be

430
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,320
reused then depending upon the client

431
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
and the circumstances you can make some

432
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
changes but other than that

433
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,160
a lot of

434
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,920
content can be reused or you can

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,120
automate it right so the actual writing

436
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
or the challenges faced by pen testers

437
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,639
if we see

438
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,880
is in the proof of concept section so we

439
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
are going to talk about how proof of

440
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,279
concept can be framed how we can frame

441
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,240
sentences uh by using various ways

442
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
and

443
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,839
this will also help you with the

444
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,440
description as well but since

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
description is a generic part and not

446
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,519
very challenging we will focus on proof

447
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,880
of concept for this session

448
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
now if you see here the question was do

449
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,639
you write a lot of reports

450
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,720
so yes but there are some places where

451
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,800
the reports are completely automated

452
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,959
okay

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,880
now for this session

454
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,519
i have created a formula report writing

455
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,360
will be storytelling plus immediate

456
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
takeaways

457
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
now storytelling and immediate takeaways

458
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,520
are basically two sections in this ppt

459
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,359
in this session so when i say

460
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,799
storytelling

461
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,799
it is going to be all about writing

462
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,039
and writing takes time you will start

463
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
writing you will gather feedback

464
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,199
you will work upon all the changes that

465
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
are suggested to you and gradually you

466
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,599
will improve your storytelling or

467
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
writing

468
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
but immediate takeaways these are some

469
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
basic points which you can immediately

470
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
start implementing in your technical

471
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,400
write-ups

472
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
now decent writing and store or

473
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
storytelling and these basic pointers

474
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,799
together will definitely ensure that 60

475
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
to 70 percent of your work is done

476
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
now remaining

477
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
40 to 30 percent work will be done by

478
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
reviewers when you get a different

479
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,080
perspective or input on your reports

480
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
you automatically

481
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,400
get good quality points

482
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
and your work is done like 80 to 90

483
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,919
percent work is done there because

484
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,840
someone is reviewing it

485
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
and when we spend a lot of time

486
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
in our reports there'll be a point that

487
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
we cannot find any mistakes in it fair

488
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
enough fresh the power of fresh

489
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
perspective is

490
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
really great

491
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
the storytelling and immediate takeaways

492
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
and reviewing a very important part of

493
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
report writing process will ensure that

494
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
you have a good quality report with you

495
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,559
so like i said

496
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,880
storytelling will take time so first

497
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,919
let's understand the immediate takeaways

498
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
now you can also have a checklist in

499
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
place you can note down the points like

500
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
okay

501
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,960
as in when you

502
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
check one one points

503
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
i mean once you write your report you

504
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
can check then if these basic pointers

505
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,199
were ensured in the report

506
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
now the first point is getting the names

507
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
right

508
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,559
now just like how our names are official

509
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,080
and defined

510
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,600
the name of a software tool attack

511
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
parameters

512
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,520
our organization name client

513
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
organization name these are all official

514
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,039
and defined and in no way should we

515
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,480
change those

516
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
now the best way to understand

517
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
the official names

518
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,720
for the tools or attacks or parameters

519
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
is to check official websites

520
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
whatever is written then written there

521
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
you can use it in your reports for

522
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
example jquery not jquery with small

523
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
queue click jacking

524
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
like this is wrong

525
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,840
now csrf token if in request the

526
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
developers have written csrf token like

527
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
this please do not change it to csrf

528
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
token small t or csrf space token

529
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,720
now if you observe that later looks like

530
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
an english word like we are talking

531
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
about csrf token in the request that's

532
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
it but not the csrf token the tokens

533
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,880
theme

534
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,280
so this is important even attacks like

535
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
poodle it's an abbreviation so you need

536
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
to write it like that these small

537
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
important things if you take care

538
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
initially

539
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,880
during reviews a lot of time will be

540
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
saved

541
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
another important point is images or

542
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
screenshots

543
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
images or screenshots are used as

544
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
evidence in reports they support your

545
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,919
proof of concept and helps client

546
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,640
reproduce the issue

547
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,600
now

548
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,559
images are really important

549
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,720
one because just imagine if there's a

550
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
report uh having only descriptive lines

551
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
and no

552
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,159
image

553
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
it will be very difficult for you also

554
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
to paste your output

555
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,000
to show the client of the exact scene

556
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
that happened when you executed a

557
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,000
command

558
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,440
so

559
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,240
description and images together

560
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,320
enables readers to understand better

561
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
what had happened and the folders that

562
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
you visited and how the output or the

563
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
error looked

564
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,360
also there is one more thing that images

565
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,799
are important

566
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,919
it is important for a consultant or a

567
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,440
tester as well

568
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
sometimes suppose there are two three

569
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,400
pen testers testing one asset

570
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
and suppose a tool is giving you a

571
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,480
different output or an ip is unavailable

572
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
to you so when you attach a screenshot

573
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
it gives readers the idea that okay

574
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
really at that point of time this tool

575
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
did not work as expected with you or an

576
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,559
ip was not really available so it's a

577
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,440
proof

578
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
for yourself as well and when any issue

579
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,039
is found for the clients as well

580
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,720
now the basic checks

581
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,039
related to images that you should take

582
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,640
care

583
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,919
alignment

584
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,679
consistency is the key

585
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,320
if you have aligned your image towards

586
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
the left

587
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
ensure all your images are aligned

588
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,679
towards the left

589
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,720
or center whatever consistency is the

590
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
key here

591
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,559
clarity the image should be clear

592
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,840
now it may so happen that the font size

593
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,000
on the terminal might be really

594
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
small

595
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
so when you take the entire

596
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
page

597
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
the image will automatically become

598
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
smaller and it may be unreadable so

599
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
clarity is important even the terminals

600
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,159
of some tools or some operating systems

601
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,159
are like transparent so the back end

602
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,760
folders are visible

603
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,520
so ensure that you have a correct

604
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,559
setting

605
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,600
and

606
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
relevant highlights

607
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
some tool outputs give a lot of uh

608
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
out some tools give a lot of output you

609
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,520
know like there'll be a huge page

610
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,400
so if the page is important

611
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
you can paste it but ensure that you are

612
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
highlighting relevant points so that the

613
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
reader is automatically directed towards

614
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,480
those highlights and they don't have to

615
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
search okay what is to be seen here if

616
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,919
you say

617
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,679
some old version has been detected so

618
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,120
where is it because there's a lot of

619
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
write up a lot of content numbers

620
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
versions license information there could

621
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,640
be anything so highlights are important

622
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,799
apart from that highlights are important

623
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,720
masking is important

624
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
now if your poc is about hashes or

625
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
passwords

626
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
even though you are sharing it with your

627
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
client there are many stakeholders in

628
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,159
the client organization as well

629
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,000
so in order to

630
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,559
keep that privacy mask those hashes or

631
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,320
passwords because we don't want anybody

632
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
to understand the pattern of it we can

633
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,159
have in internal malicious actors right

634
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,320
so it's best that you mask hashes so

635
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,720
that nobody is make able to make sense

636
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
out of it

637
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
another reason masking is important is

638
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,760
like suppose you're capturing your

639
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,480
entire desktop screen

640
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
and by mistake there's a folder about

641
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
some other client so you don't want to

642
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
give that information or if there is any

643
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,440
personal information

644
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
or bookmarks and you don't want to

645
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,080
reveal that so ensure that correct

646
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
things are masked before you are

647
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,520
submitting your report again these are

648
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
basic things that you can

649
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,360
if you have a checklist i think it will

650
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,679
it will be easier you can take that okay

651
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
alignment has been reviewed for self

652
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,400
review you can make a checklist of these

653
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
immediate takeaway points

654
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,880
now highlights and emphasis

655
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,360
okay so in cyber security we come across

656
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
various terms which mean differently in

657
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,440
english language and in cyber security

658
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,919
engagements for example when we say a

659
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,039
cookie was not secure okay now if you

660
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,799
are talking to a fellow pen tester he

661
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,640
will immediately understand that you are

662
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,159
talking about insecure cookie

663
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,000
transmissions

664
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,960
but

665
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
if you have written it just like this

666
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,760
a reader

667
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
will think that you're talking about

668
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
a cookie which is not secured that is it

669
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,520
is not protected that's it but if you

670
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,559
add a single quote over here for secure

671
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,919
if you add a single quote you're

672
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
automatically stressing that this is not

673
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,320
ordinary secure term

674
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,279
we are trying to say something else

675
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
we are talking about the attribute

676
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,279
secure so this message automatically

677
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,120
gets delivered if you hide if you use

678
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,320
highlights and emphasis in a proper way

679
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,880
another example i can think of is a tool

680
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
called eyewitness

681
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,559
so if you say using eyewitness you did

682
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,000
xyz

683
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,480
so if there are no highlight of some

684
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,919
kind or if you don't add this term tool

685
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,799
so eyewitnesses also means human beings

686
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,039
human being eyewitness as a proof of

687
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
concept

688
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,039
so highlights and emphasis is important

689
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
now you can use bold italics single

690
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
double quotes again consistency is the

691
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,559
key here

692
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,279
if you have started with bold

693
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,600
use that throughout single quotes then

694
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,279
single quotes

695
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,039
avoid using underlines because

696
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,960
underlines will give it a flavor of a

697
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,559
link

698
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,640
or even color codes like sometimes

699
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,720
you're using red green people the

700
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
readers might not know of the color

701
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,840
codes

702
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
so avoid colors

703
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,279
and

704
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,919
you can stick to these options

705
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,880
and again you can make a habit like

706
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,240
if you are writing a report anytime

707
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,720
it will be bold only always so that

708
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,000
there is no confusion and you will

709
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,360
automatically get that hang of

710
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,679
consistency as well

711
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,440
so this is why highlights and emphasis

712
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
are important

713
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,000
even for that matter codes scripts if

714
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,960
you are

715
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,159
appending

716
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,720
code or

717
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,039
code snippets in your report

718
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,799
you may want to use a different form so

719
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,640
that the reader understands immediately

720
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,240
okay this looks like

721
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
a request captured in any tool maybe so

722
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
you get that effect that okay this is

723
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,960
something different this is a script

724
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
so use these things even for payload you

725
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,799
can use a different font

726
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,919
suppose if there's a url and in the url

727
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
there's a affected parameter and you

728
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,919
have appended your payload so try to

729
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,520
give a different format to the payloads

730
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
that just by looking at it you know this

731
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,279
is not something regular not a part of

732
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,480
the url

733
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,320
so these are things that you can you

734
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,760
should definitely

735
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,279
implement in your reports

736
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,679
case consistency another basic simple

737
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,080
thing that you can immediately start

738
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,279
taking care of

739
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,600
the title subtitles or figure captions

740
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,679
must have case consistency

741
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,919
now either all the titles are

742
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,039
like this

743
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,080
like the first letter is capital or the

744
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
first letter is capital and the first

745
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,000
letter of second word is not

746
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,159
so this consistency is also important

747
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,200
be it titles subtitles or figure

748
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,840
captions the same rules

749
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,240
apply now imagine if you don't take care

750
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,960
of this and if you get a feedback that

751
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,640
please ensure consistency this is going

752
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
to be extremely time consuming later on

753
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
so you

754
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
might

755
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,279
have to note this initially

756
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,720
again like i said make your own

757
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,080
checklist

758
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,600
and

759
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
just decide that this is what you are

760
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
going to stick to

761
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
no matter what

762
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,640
report you write

763
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
so these are some of the immediate

764
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
takeaways

765
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,880
that you can immediately start

766
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,640
implementing apart from this there are

767
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
some points like not using ampersand for

768
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
formal writings it's not wrong nobody

769
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,720
even highlight that

770
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
but we can avoid ampersand using etc a

771
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
lot

772
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
you can end it like this like x y and z

773
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
such as x y and z so when we say such as

774
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,360
x y and z we are automatically implying

775
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,520
that there could be more such as this

776
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,720
this and this

777
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,200
so you can you should avoid etcetera if

778
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,760
possible so these are some simple things

779
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
that you can avoid

780
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,639
in your writing

781
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,039
okay coming to storytelling

782
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,960
this is where

783
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,720
we are going to talk about writing and

784
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,559
in pentes reports proof of concept

785
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,919
section is the section where

786
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,399
storytelling happens

787
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,080
and this is one part which cannot be

788
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,640
automated this will be different as per

789
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
different situations different clients

790
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
you can automate the description of

791
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,279
vulnerabilities or remedial measures but

792
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,039
storytelling

793
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,720
you have to do it there is like no

794
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,679
running away from it

795
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
now as a part of that survey there was

796
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,919
one question which section in the report

797
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,840
do you find challenging

798
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
so if you see poc a lot of people had

799
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
troubles with poc description impact

800
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
there were a lot of more responses all

801
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,600
geared towards poc so yes of course poc

802
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,720
because

803
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
vulnerabilities can get complicated

804
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,159
and

805
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,000
explaining this

806
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,520
to readers can be challenging

807
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
okay so before anything we need to

808
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,360
understand the concept of proof of

809
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
concept

810
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,840
now this line is important

811
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,279
penetration testing is a proof of

812
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,120
concept based approach of finding

813
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,880
vulnerabilities

814
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
so it's a proof of concept based

815
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
approach not exploitation based

816
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
exploitation does not happen always

817
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
for some reason we are required to do

818
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
non-intrusive testing

819
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
right

820
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
sometimes due to time constraints we

821
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,520
cannot exploit

822
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,159
a vulnerability fully

823
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,120
so pen testing is a proof of concept

824
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,640
based approach okay

825
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,559
so what is a proof of concept so proof

826
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
of concept is basically where our focus

827
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
is towards determining

828
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,120
whether an idea or a concept can be

829
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,360
turned into reality it might not be

830
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,600
complete but can this be developed

831
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
modified further

832
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,520
into a wholesome attack

833
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,519
correct so this is proof of concept

834
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,200
now the main purpose of poc is to

835
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
demonstrate the vulnerability and to

836
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,080
verify a certain concept or theory that

837
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,559
can be achieved in development

838
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,480
now proof of concept means different and

839
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
different domains okay like software

840
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,360
testing poc versus prototypes there is a

841
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,840
different argument right there

842
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
in cyber security like i said

843
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,799
whether an idea can be converted to

844
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,279
reality this is the key point here

845
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,320
now

846
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,159
i did not think

847
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,600
of this really deeply when i started but

848
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,760
i was just going through some exploit

849
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,840
codes and i wanted to

850
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,720
determine scores okay

851
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
so i saw that some public exploits were

852
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
rated as high

853
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,880
okay

854
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,039
so the description associated with high

855
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,360
was that the exploit code is functional

856
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,000
it works in all the situations

857
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,760
publicly available and plus there are

858
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,120
automated tools available for it or the

859
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
code is written in such a way that it

860
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,120
can be automated so it was most harmful

861
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,799
then i saw if

862
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,000
high exploit code is functional in every

863
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
situations then what is functional

864
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,919
exploit code so the functional exploit

865
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,120
was

866
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,919
described in just one line that

867
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,159
functional exploit code

868
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,240
works in most of the situations that's

869
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,960
it so basically this was high but high

870
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,760
always worked could be automated

871
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
functional worked in most of the

872
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,399
situations not always

873
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,639
okay

874
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,399
then there was something called as the

875
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,799
exploit code was just proof of concept

876
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,919
based so meaning it was not 100

877
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,840
and a lot of modifications were to be

878
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,320
required from the testers or consultants

879
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
end

880
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,799
so when i

881
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,880
read about the difference between these

882
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,200
three terms that is

883
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,399
when i realized okay so proof of concept

884
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,279
is

885
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,080
uh in itself a different concept and yes

886
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
this is what it means

887
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
so when i

888
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
was exploring about exploit quotes i

889
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,399
came to know the

890
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,840
deep meaning of proof of concept

891
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,640
again it reminds me that now since proof

892
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
of concept is not

893
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,720
might not really be wholesome

894
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
a lot of low and informational

895
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,799
vulnerabilities should be reported

896
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,360
because we are talking about

897
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,000
development here like today we are not

898
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,799
able to exploit but tomorrow this idea

899
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,120
can be exploited

900
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,880
so anything you

901
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,760
feel

902
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
can become a big issue tomorrow should

903
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,159
be reported so that is what a proof of

904
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,640
concept is

905
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,399
now the target audience this will

906
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,840
determine an important part of writing

907
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,480
so when you say client it's never one

908
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,120
entity when it's spent as profession but

909
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,679
an entire organization involving various

910
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,440
stakeholders

911
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,360
some of the various stakeholders are as

912
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,480
below

913
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,320
senior management technical and

914
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
non-technical

915
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,200
now since this is a senior management

916
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
and since we are talking about security

917
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,560
of our own organization security posture

918
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
i think everybody will be interested

919
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
so when we say security senior

920
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,719
management it's it can be technical and

921
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,800
non-technical so that is your first

922
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,960
audience there

923
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,440
then we have developers

924
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,359
because if a web application has been

925
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,320
developed by a developer it is them who

926
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,560
should know about the flaws and the

927
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,839
remedy is going to be implemented by the

928
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
developers so yes the developers must

929
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,520
understand

930
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,918
the vulnerability and also the remedial

931
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,480
measures and clarity so that they can

932
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,320
make those changes in their product or

933
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,560
their application then we have our

934
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,040
fellow pen testers now suppose for some

935
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,399
reason you cannot continue your pen test

936
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,639
or you might not be able to

937
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,200
give report debriefs or anything so your

938
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,240
fellow pen testers will take that ahead

939
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,440
or if you have been working in teams

940
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
then your pen testers

941
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,520
may continue your project like for

942
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,119
example you wrote the report but someone

943
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,800
else is going to present

944
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,720
so your fellow pen testers will refer

945
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,079
your report okay so this is one audience

946
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,520
who should understand whatever you have

947
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,800
written

948
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,880
now pen testers could be in our

949
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
organization and in target organization

950
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,079
as well

951
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,400
so this is the third audience that is

952
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,839
going to read your pen test report

953
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,000
and of course auditors who refer pentest

954
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,839
reports as a part of audit like if there

955
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,560
is annual audit biannual sorry or annual

956
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,720
pen tests by annually pen tests and if

957
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
there is a criteria for some

958
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,480
certification then they will want to see

959
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,760
of course they are not going to refer it

960
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,359
in deep

961
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,920
but they will go through it so this is

962
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,280
your fourth audience who's going to

963
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
refer to your

964
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,800
pen test reports

965
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
report

966
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
now if you observe they are technical

967
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,480
people except for the non-tech senior

968
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,160
management everybody is technical but

969
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,079
their level of technical competency is

970
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,160
different

971
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,400
so your your challenge is

972
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,040
to effectively educate all these

973
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,280
stakeholders at their level

974
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,079
and

975
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,079
you are going to be delivering only one

976
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,160
report so you need to be damn sure

977
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,320
that your report

978
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,440
is written in such a way that all these

979
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,000
readers

980
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,079
so that all these readers are going to

981
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,760
make sense out of it

982
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,960
okay

983
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
so a single document that is of

984
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,920
beneficial to these people are technical

985
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,359
but they have different technical

986
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,320
competency now what is it that what is

987
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,240
the common element

988
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,400
that will allow you to write a report

989
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
which is understood by all these

990
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
stakeholders so that is simplicity a

991
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,000
simple writing cuts thick skulls

992
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,119
so when

993
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,760
you write in the most basic way that is

994
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,839
easier for you as a writer

995
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,480
and everybody can make sense out of it

996
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,359
so

997
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,359
simple writing it is when it's pen

998
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,480
testing

999
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
you have to ensure that you are basic

1000
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
and there are no shortcuts and you just

1001
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,160
write all the steps

1002
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,760
now using plain english

1003
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,359
now i didn't know about this concept

1004
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,720
before but recently i came across this

1005
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
plain english now plain english is a

1006
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,480
language

1007
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,240
which is

1008
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,599
which

1009
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,200
uh which asks the writers to use only as

1010
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,520
many words as necessary

1011
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,760
so we achieve plain english by using

1012
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
everyday words it is the simplest form

1013
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,560
of writing the idea is to allow readers

1014
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,720
to only focus on the message instead of

1015
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,079
being distracted by jargons any

1016
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,359
complicated

1017
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,400
phrases

1018
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,960
or any complication for example if you

1019
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,880
want to write some

1020
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,839
word

1021
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,839
and you are

1022
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,160
writing a formal document and then you

1023
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
check for synonyms then you're

1024
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,960
complicating it

1025
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
plain english is all about keeping

1026
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,560
things really simple

1027
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
now i would really suggest that you all

1028
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,119
read more about plain english there are

1029
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,079
also campaigns where in which

1030
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,960
people are trying to uh

1031
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,079
rewrite

1032
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,599
official high of highly official

1033
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,680
documents beat government and all in

1034
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,280
simple language so that a layman can

1035
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,800
understand so this is the whole

1036
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,560
objective of plain english

1037
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,800
plus plain english makes good business

1038
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,359
sense and you might want to read and

1039
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,680
this will help you greatly when writing

1040
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,119
pentest reports

1041
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,720
because we do have findings which are

1042
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,680
really

1043
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,359
complicated

1044
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,680
and if you stick to plain english

1045
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,440
because pen test reports a formal report

1046
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
so we end up thinking that okay do we

1047
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,880
want to use some

1048
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
high five words no

1049
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,280
plain english is all about using simple

1050
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,920
languages everyday words and it is used

1051
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
in business

1052
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,800
documents as well

1053
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,240
so this is something that you should

1054
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,680
definitely explore more

1055
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,040
now sentence construction

1056
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,240
we all talk talk about uh different

1057
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,560
ways like read so that your writing

1058
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
improves speak so that your writing

1059
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,280
improves

1060
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
but to improve writing you write

1061
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,280
and you get it reviewed so that you get

1062
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,760
feedback and you again write and this is

1063
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,280
the only way how you can improve your

1064
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
writing

1065
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,440
so now if you're talking about

1066
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,760
people writing or storytelling sentence

1067
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,640
construction is important

1068
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,079
so one of the most important

1069
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,040
part

1070
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,960
in sentence construction that greatly

1071
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,359
helps me is mind maps now when i say

1072
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,359
mind maps i'm not talking about any tool

1073
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,280
on the system like using your mouse

1074
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,200
dragging from here to there of course

1075
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,079
when the complication is high

1076
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,960
and

1077
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,119
if your mind maps is going to be really

1078
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,359
really big then you cannot do it offline

1079
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,880
then you need tools

1080
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,640
but then you know pen and paper the

1081
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,400
power of pen and paper doodles is really

1082
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,640
underrated

1083
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,200
so what i feel is no matter what the

1084
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,160
attack is if i have a white board or a

1085
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,040
notepad in front of me before starting

1086
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,720
to frame

1087
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
poc

1088
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,119
poc statements or sentences what i do is

1089
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,520
i just start doodling okay now i've got

1090
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,480
idor

1091
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,800
what was the action okay password could

1092
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,839
be changed

1093
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,720
what was since it's idol what was the

1094
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,760
exposed parameter or the insecure object

1095
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
id parameter okay was authentication

1096
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,280
required you write your yes no

1097
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,240
now if you also got something related to

1098
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
privileges like if you could escalate

1099
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,440
privileges then talk about the user with

1100
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,839
the user that you used to sign into an

1101
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,480
account to sign into the application so

1102
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,760
you write your user a with low

1103
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,319
privileges then idea of user a was

1104
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,880
changed to to that of b

1105
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
and we had high privileges so you know

1106
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,920
make these star marks and

1107
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,119
make doodles

1108
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,520
now if you see this might this is not an

1109
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,160
order it's okay if you have not

1110
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,839
followed a particular stepwise order but

1111
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,440
once you have this in front of you you

1112
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,319
can refer to it and then decide

1113
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,480
okay the first step should be user a

1114
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,880
with low privileges so you can say

1115
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,319
that the tester signed into the

1116
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,760
application

1117
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,599
with the role of user a which had low

1118
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,160
privileges so this is how you can frame

1119
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,240
sentences

1120
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,640
this you can also do in the report

1121
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,319
report itself like before starting the

1122
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,880
poc section just make bullet points this

1123
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,520
was the issue this is important to this

1124
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,079
finding like idol so first is what is

1125
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,560
that direct object note that url

1126
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,480
affected parameter

1127
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,560
what could be done

1128
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,200
so mind maps and doodlings rough work

1129
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,359
greatly helps in sentence construction

1130
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,400
this is really important

1131
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,480
so what happens is when you have this in

1132
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,240
place you can simply slowly frame

1133
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,560
sentences around it your job becomes a

1134
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,079
lot easier rather than you know just

1135
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,720
seeing the screenshots and if everything

1136
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,960
is in your mind it's difficult okay what

1137
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,800
had happened so first you can have a

1138
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,839
rough work and then make it fair

1139
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,240
another important point is dictionary

1140
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,359
now if you're using ms word or any other

1141
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,319
tool

1142
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
any other software

1143
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,119
so like for example in word

1144
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,560
xyz

1145
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,960
was able to do

1146
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,240
something

1147
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,440
so was able to automatically get

1148
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
a red line below it so that will be

1149
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,040
replaced by good

1150
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,079
correct in order to gets replaced by two

1151
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
so there are

1152
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,319
these things use the power of computers

1153
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,440
you can have various tools for uh spell

1154
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,920
checks dictionary keep it on and just

1155
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,000
see the suggestions now when and if

1156
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
you're using plain english you're

1157
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,480
already

1158
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,640
writing in a most basic language and

1159
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
with this suggestions you'll get a good

1160
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
decent sentence right there so use

1161
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,240
dictionaries and everything that is

1162
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,200
easily available

1163
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,440
then we have tenses

1164
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,920
now the tense for any verb

1165
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,680
is its setting

1166
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,920
in that time okay

1167
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,359
now first you need to decide whether

1168
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,960
your proof of concept is going to be in

1169
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,599
past tense present tense or future tense

1170
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,480
then you stick to that decision

1171
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,079
ensure consistency and only change if

1172
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,720
there is a need for that tone to change

1173
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
mixed tenses are allowed

1174
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,480
but

1175
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,240
depends upon the situation

1176
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,319
now if you see this sentence it was

1177
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,240
discovered that the application used an

1178
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,040
outdated version of xyz which is

1179
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,920
vulnerable so it was discovered which is

1180
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,119
vulnerable to cve whatever okay

1181
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,079
now here if you say which was vulnerable

1182
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,160
no that vulnerability is like kind of

1183
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,400
forever there was a version

1184
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,280
of xyz software and it is well

1185
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,079
vulnerable to this cve a cv id has been

1186
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,880
assigned and this is going to be forever

1187
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,280
so when the reader reads

1188
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,520
for him it will be like when the testing

1189
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,000
was done in the past

1190
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,839
it was discovered that an application

1191
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,720
used an outdated version of xyz

1192
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
which is vulnerable because when he is

1193
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,680
reading it

1194
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,359
even that time this fact will hold true

1195
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,119
so this is the thing about tenses

1196
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,040
nothing complicated first you decide

1197
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,839
majorly it's past or present only

1198
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,839
and mixed tenses are allowed and how you

1199
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,720
decide upon mixed tenses is with this is

1200
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,800
that thing true today then that will be

1201
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,720
in present tense think from a reader's

1202
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,279
perspective

1203
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,680
then this is reading out loud

1204
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,839
like when you frame sentences carefully

1205
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,599
craft your sentences and then when you

1206
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,280
read out louds

1207
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,640
loudly

1208
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,880
what happens is as for the punctuation

1209
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,960
you will pause and you will speak

1210
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,319
so when you're speaking when you're

1211
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,119
reading out loud any glitch that your

1212
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,960
eye could not catch

1213
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,720
your toning or your pauses will

1214
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,880
immediately highlight you if there is

1215
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
any change or if there is any

1216
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,240
disconnect

1217
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
you will find that out by reading your

1218
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,280
sentences loudly okay that glitch you

1219
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,760
will immediately catch that

1220
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,200
so once you have doodled start to frame

1221
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,640
sentences

1222
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,640
if you are using

1223
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,000
word or any tools whatever

1224
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,800
you'll get suggestions use that simply

1225
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,760
don't

1226
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,359
waste don't invest time in you know

1227
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,599
specifically finding flaws

1228
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,359
whatever

1229
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,960
is highlighted it's fine you can make

1230
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,599
that change at that point of time

1231
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,160
tenses decide i think if you are in an

1232
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,480
organization then this

1233
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,079
must have already been decided like your

1234
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,240
proof of concepts are from

1235
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,839
in the past tense

1236
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,240
but if it's your choice then again make

1237
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,760
a checklist for yourself that all your

1238
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,359
pocs going ahead are going to be like

1239
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,640
this

1240
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
so then this gets sorted

1241
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,720
and read out loud whatever you write so

1242
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,119
that anything that your eye could not

1243
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,160
capture

1244
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,040
is sound will

1245
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,480
now rule of thumb

1246
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,800
so think of any finding how do you make

1247
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,040
mind maps you need to determine what is

1248
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,800
important to a particular vulnerability

1249
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,680
like we saw i dot insecure direct object

1250
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,440
so what is that object first thing

1251
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,079
should be i dot object okay then you can

1252
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,720
write about that affected parameter

1253
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,960
then another thing important about idol

1254
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,920
would be

1255
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,119
if you could get privilege escalation

1256
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,800
right about that because this is after

1257
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,319
all you're talking about broken access

1258
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,800
control here so you jot down points

1259
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,240
which are important to a particular

1260
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,960
vulnerability if it were csrf then

1261
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,400
victim authentication would have been

1262
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,680
important

1263
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,200
this again depends upon the user

1264
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,560
accounts that you are provided for the

1265
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
test

1266
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
the user that you used as a victim and

1267
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,160
as an attacker you need to determine all

1268
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
that roughly

1269
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,640
then a context in short now for findings

1270
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,040
like idol and csrf if there are six to

1271
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,359
seven steps involved like we said we

1272
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,400
have to stick to simplicity no shortcuts

1273
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,319
and if you are using plain english then

1274
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,000
there could be even more steps since we

1275
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,119
are explaining

1276
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
everything

1277
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,440
so the reader should not wait till your

1278
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,760
eighth or ninth step to understand what

1279
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
happened so you can provide a context in

1280
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,680
short that the application was available

1281
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,880
to idol

1282
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,240
and

1283
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,319
this allowed the tester to

1284
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,079
escalate privileges

1285
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,280
and

1286
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,520
get account takeover

1287
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,160
as the final output so give a context in

1288
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,760
short

1289
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
so that the reader readers know in

1290
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,680
advance what is to be expected

1291
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,319
user accounts and privileges provided

1292
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,040
this is important uh if authentication

1293
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,520
is important uh to exploit any

1294
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,119
vulnerability so you need to talk about

1295
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,480
that about the user accounts and

1296
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
privileges provided and especially for

1297
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,960
findings like idol csrf

1298
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,119
privileges are important like the user

1299
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,040
that you used

1300
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,440
or the user account you used to sign

1301
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,640
into the application and then you

1302
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,240
initiated the attack so talk about that

1303
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,599
then there is modification the

1304
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,079
modification that you did

1305
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,800
um suppose id was set to one and you

1306
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,640
changed it to two talk about this

1307
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
modification what was changed from what

1308
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,079
to then what

1309
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,240
was brute force used like automatically

1310
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,319
it was changing and then you got so many

1311
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,920
responses and in one response you

1312
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,520
identified that okay this was an admin

1313
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,440
account or something so you talk about

1314
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,960
that

1315
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,599
then again final outcome

1316
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,960
what could be achieved if account

1317
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,800
takeover then you better show them that

1318
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,559
you could sign in show them that

1319
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,640
interface so the this is the thumb rule

1320
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,720
before writing determine these things

1321
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,000
what is important to a particular

1322
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,960
vulnerability provide a context in short

1323
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,520
and then steps depending upon these

1324
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,960
questions these pointers

1325
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,599
now suppose we are taking the example of

1326
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,720
idol

1327
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,400
now what is important to this finding

1328
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,680
this is important to create mind maps

1329
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,640
like what could happen

1330
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,559
like what could happen uh you could

1331
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,720
change a user's password

1332
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,839
you could gain admins

1333
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,880
account

1334
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,640
so you need to determine that note it

1335
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,240
somewhere then what was the affected

1336
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,720
parameter and user privileges so these

1337
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,920
are basically

1338
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,839
these

1339
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,920
questions okay so for idol you answer

1340
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,240
those questions and make a rough note of

1341
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,119
it or mind maps of it

1342
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,079
now

1343
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,359
suppose

1344
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,240
this is the situation

1345
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,920
any user could change the password of

1346
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,319
other user affected parameter was id so

1347
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,000
how would you write

1348
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,760
the proof of concept for this finding

1349
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,400
this issue

1350
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,160
the mind maps would look something like

1351
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,599
this

1352
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,440
the main action password change possible

1353
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,599
this was the object authentication was

1354
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,599
required

1355
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,920
user a with low privileges

1356
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,480
this was a modification done id was

1357
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,240
changed id of a was changed to that of b

1358
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,480
and we had high privileges

1359
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,880
so instead of a password of b was

1360
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,680
changed when the request was submitted

1361
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,960
due to this the tester could get the

1362
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,400
access of

1363
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,800
b users account

1364
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,040
so these are just this is just rough

1365
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,839
work

1366
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,839
and then you frame sentences around it

1367
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,240
okay so this is your context that was

1368
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,760
identified that web application was

1369
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
vulnerable to idol

1370
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,680
the affected parameter was id and by

1371
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,880
changing it

1372
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,440
any application user could change

1373
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,680
password of other user this is the basic

1374
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,040
context

1375
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
so in case a reader or some senior

1376
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,640
management doesn't want to read the

1377
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,559
steps he'll be satisfied with this

1378
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,240
paragraph that okay this was the

1379
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,599
vulnerability and this happened

1380
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,359
then you can further demonstrate the

1381
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,040
vulnerability

1382
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
for anybody like developers your fellow

1383
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,800
pen testers

1384
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,480
any technical person from the client

1385
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,119
organization who wants to understand

1386
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,280
the vulnerability in depth

1387
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,119
this is step one

1388
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,280
tester signed in as

1389
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,920
user a a low privileged user and clicked

1390
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,079
on changed password to change this

1391
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,559
user's password now a low privileged

1392
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,880
user is important because in this case

1393
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,240
we did get

1394
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,599
uh

1395
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,839
access of a high privileged user and if

1396
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,240
you were provided a low privileged user

1397
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,839
before testing then you need to mention

1398
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,839
about it

1399
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,839
normally people just directly start

1400
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,440
that the tester

1401
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,640
clicked on change

1402
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,520
change password to change users password

1403
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,760
okay but this is really important that

1404
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,599
during testing what was the role that

1405
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,119
you assumed

1406
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,760
correct so first step should be about

1407
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,400
that the tester signed in as user a a

1408
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,359
low privileged user

1409
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,240
then you talk about

1410
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,640
interception of that request tester

1411
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,880
intercepted this change password request

1412
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,240
in a proxy

1413
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,880
or any yeah proxy tool and observe that

1414
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,240
there was an id parameter in the request

1415
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,280
so here you talk about the main

1416
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,680
part of idol vulnerability the insecure

1417
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,559
object

1418
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,040
and it was in the request of change

1419
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,240
password action

1420
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,680
then the tester changed a user's id

1421
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,400
parameter to that of b user a high

1422
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,079
privileged user provided for testing

1423
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,839
purpose okay

1424
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,920
and the request was submitted or

1425
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,200
forwarded

1426
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,040
step four should be it was observed that

1427
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,359
the request was accepted by the server

1428
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,079
and the password of user b instead of a

1429
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,680
was changed

1430
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,240
in this way tester who signed it as a

1431
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,440
user got account access of buser via an

1432
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,400
insecure direct object reference that is

1433
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,200
in the password change request so if you

1434
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,800
see

1435
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,960
this is how this is the most simplest

1436
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,079
and the basic way in which in four steps

1437
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,680
we completed idols poc

1438
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,839
so the moral of the story is

1439
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,599
you need to stick to basics and if

1440
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,839
anybody reads it they will understand

1441
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,079
this finding

1442
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,720
and stick to the thumb rule

1443
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,440
talk about what is important like

1444
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,640
object

1445
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,559
in eye law the object is important so

1446
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,960
where did you find that so mention all

1447
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,480
that

1448
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,640
then again

1449
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,040
a user's id parameter was changed to

1450
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,280
that of b user a high privileged user

1451
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,880
provided for testing purpose so that the

1452
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,640
readers understand that okay two user

1453
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,640
accounts are provided so these are some

1454
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,880
important things that you can simply

1455
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,760
put

1456
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,359
of course these steps are to be

1457
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,520
supported with images

1458
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,920
so that the user

1459
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,599
along with description and with images

1460
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,359
they will understand it better there are

1461
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,319
images will come here after every step

1462
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,040
now don't combine two three steps don't

1463
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,640
miss out on pocs

1464
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,720
now sometimes what happen is

1465
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,240
people will directly start with step

1466
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,280
three

1467
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,440
that tester changed a user's id

1468
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,520
parameter to that of b

1469
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,319
not wrong but then if you go step wise

1470
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,480
it's easier for anybody to understand a

1471
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,079
technical person will understand from

1472
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,839
step three as well

1473
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,839
but the main point like we saw was

1474
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,000
simplicity

1475
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,119
so you

1476
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,800
break it up

1477
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,760
at the lowest level possible and if

1478
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,079
needed if needed

1479
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,359
if you think and if your reviewer

1480
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,119
suggests that step one and step two can

1481
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,760
be combined then do that but the first

1482
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
time go as

1483
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,200
go to the lowest level as possible so

1484
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,400
that at least the reviewer also

1485
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,559
understands then maybe you all can

1486
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,400
decide about combining sentences and

1487
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,799
everything

1488
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,200
now for idol kind of vulnerabilities

1489
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,480
avoid

1490
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,880
merging everything in one step

1491
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,960
do not directly give the image of the

1492
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,640
final step or the second step for

1493
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,880
example you have four steps and you are

1494
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,440
just showing the final step

1495
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,240
try to give pocs or screenshots at every

1496
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,959
step remember simplicity is the key

1497
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,319
again now if we have to talk about csrf

1498
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,319
so remember that thumb rule what is

1499
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,440
important to this finding make mind maps

1500
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,000
victim user and the attacker user now if

1501
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,799
you have been given two users

1502
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,400
which was the victim user and the

1503
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,640
attacker user the attacker user here

1504
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,040
will be the tester okay now if if

1505
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,799
authentication was uh

1506
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,880
authentication is a must for csrs so you

1507
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,040
did sign in using some user account

1508
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,480
correct

1509
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,000
and

1510
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,559
if you're using that user account to

1511
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,880
target another user that was provided

1512
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,359
so you are the attacker so the first

1513
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,760
important point is that you signed in

1514
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,319
for the application using user a who's

1515
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,000
attacker for this demonstration

1516
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,799
then you talk about the html poc or the

1517
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,319
script because csrf is one attack where

1518
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,079
social engineering will be required if

1519
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,640
you want to compromise the victim user

1520
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,079
because there has to be some way that

1521
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,480
you send a malicious url or a malicious

1522
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,319
payload to the victim and they have to

1523
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,760
click on that link

1524
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,000
for some action or an unintended

1525
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,559
activity to happen correct

1526
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:19,440
so

1527
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,680
talk about the html poc show them the

1528
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,040
raw html poc show them that okay xyz was

1529
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,760
set to true and you changed it to false

1530
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,119
show them that

1531
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,000
tell the readers that when any user

1532
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,640
clicks on this html page

1533
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,359
their account will be changed

1534
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:38,960
whatever was set to true will be to

1535
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,119
false so this is important that you

1536
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,599
describe the html poc or any of the

1537
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,680
script that you are using for csrf

1538
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,839
exploitation there has to be a line

1539
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,040
about that

1540
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,559
then you talk about the modification

1541
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,319
that happen password change then

1542
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,559
password change and final outcome like

1543
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,720
account takeover or whatever that you

1544
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,359
could achieve

1545
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,079
so now if i have i had to do csrf mind

1546
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,720
maps so your csrf then first thing that

1547
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,559
comes to our mind token

1548
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,040
absent was that no token or there was a

1549
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,359
token but it was invalidated so these

1550
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,760
are the two questions you can just

1551
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
make a rough note about your

1552
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,359
roughly

1553
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,520
then what happened like password change

1554
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,160
user you signed in as and the privileges

1555
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,319
if user accounts were provided what were

1556
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,720
the what were their privileges was there

1557
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,040
any kind of privilege escalation if yes

1558
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,280
then this point is important then you

1559
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,119
talk about modification

1560
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,559
and how you did it html or any script

1561
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,920
you can further go down that html

1562
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,440
setting of um xyz was true changed to

1563
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,640
false

1564
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,559
who was a victim user and what were his

1565
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,720
privileges and social engineering

1566
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,520
aspects if you are normally people don't

1567
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,079
write about social engineering as a part

1568
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,720
of csrf poc because then it will become

1569
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,040
longer like we directly show the html

1570
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,839
page with the submit button

1571
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,000
and action happens but if you want to

1572
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,559
write you can go ahead like

1573
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,680
the link was sent via an email to any

1574
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,440
employee like if fixed user accounts are

1575
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
not provided and if you have to target

1576
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,000
any employees then maybe you can talk

1577
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,520
about this

1578
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,520
and then the final outcome

1579
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,359
so again this is these are not the

1580
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,680
perfect steps these are just mind maps

1581
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,400
like token absent invalidated depending

1582
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,960
upon the reality you keep this notepad

1583
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,160
or this

1584
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,920
page in front of you and start framing

1585
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,480
sentences

1586
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,440
so like we said context is important

1587
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,880
tester identified that the web

1588
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,280
application was vulnerable to csrf the

1589
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,200
issue allowed an application user to

1590
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
change contact preference of another

1591
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,079
user this was the context in short

1592
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,480
the senior management would like to know

1593
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,240
then you demonstrate the vulnerability

1594
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,000
in detail

1595
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,400
tester signed it as user a the attacker

1596
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,599
in this case

1597
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,400
the contact preference page of user a

1598
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
can be seen in figure below

1599
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,119
sms is their preferred contact

1600
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,040
okay so here since we are talking about

1601
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,280
contact preferences it could be sms it

1602
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,119
could be emails anything and this

1603
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,000
particular user user a had sms as their

1604
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,960
preferred contact

1605
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,480
then tester as user a that is attacker

1606
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,119
created an html page which when accessed

1607
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,440
by any application user will cause their

1608
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,079
contact preferences to be modified note

1609
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,359
that the victim user must be

1610
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,960
authenticated to the affected

1611
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,559
application so you can add this

1612
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,480
important note as a part of step

1613
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,799
so html poc

1614
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,119
or the appendix

1615
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,599
so if your html poc is a very small code

1616
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,079
or you can take a code snippet which is

1617
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,559
important one and paste it or if your

1618
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,079
code is really big move it to the

1619
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,240
appendix and then redirect user

1620
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,279
to that appendix

1621
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,240
so once you paste the code snippet here

1622
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,200
you can give a note or write such a

1623
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,280
paragraph that notice in the html code

1624
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,319
that the value of input type sms is true

1625
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,839
this means that when the victim clicks

1626
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,200
on this html page the contact preference

1627
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,280
will be updated to sms

1628
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,480
okay like any victim who clicks

1629
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,359
now

1630
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,960
tester signs in as user b who has email

1631
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,040
as his preferred contact

1632
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,000
now when b accesses the above html page

1633
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,799
created by malicious actor a and submits

1634
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,200
it the contact preference of b gets

1635
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,599
updated and sms is selected as a prefer

1636
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,240
contact for b

1637
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,040
okay

1638
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,880
so this is how you can

1639
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,280
simply explain everything keeping

1640
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,680
simplicity in mind and considering that

1641
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,440
considering the target audience which is

1642
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,960
varied for pentest reports

1643
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
this is something really important like

1644
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,079
you talk about html code and the value

1645
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,559
that is already there

1646
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,720
and if sms is set to true you can change

1647
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,920
it to false or whatever you can add a

1648
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,880
new type also maybe your if there are

1649
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,359
advanced attacks so this is something

1650
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,760
you need to think about and write so

1651
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,440
that the readers understand everything

1652
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,720
correctly and in detail

1653
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,400
step four could be you can talk about

1654
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,559
anything you are sure of

1655
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,960
like token invalidation or token missing

1656
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,240
depending upon the true situation now

1657
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,839
here we just

1658
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,599
updated the contact

1659
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,200
suppose change password was also

1660
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,640
happening if the token was not

1661
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,440
invalidated then you can talk about that

1662
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,599
as well or like i said proof of concept

1663
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,920
might not be 100

1664
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,640
a perfect exploit code

1665
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,680
so

1666
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,440
as a step for talk about possibilities

1667
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,680
that this is this could also happen

1668
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,200
or

1669
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,480
anything that you feel can happen by

1670
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
using automated tools or just by a

1671
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,440
little tweaking here and there

1672
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,920
so this was csrf csrf is also one

1673
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,200
vulnerability which is really difficult

1674
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,960
as a pen testers for us also to

1675
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
understand at the initial levels

1676
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,160
so we should understand that if we found

1677
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,400
it difficult to understand csrf

1678
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,319
correctly it will be difficult for the

1679
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,400
readers as well

1680
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,160
so keeping this in mind

1681
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,280
you need to be as simple as possible and

1682
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,119
when you're writing simply it's also a

1683
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,440
test of your uh knowledge that if you

1684
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,440
have understood a concept clearly you

1685
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,440
will write you will be able to write it

1686
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,359
in the most simplest

1687
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,440
way

1688
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,960
now moving towards common mistakes

1689
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,880
first is assumptions and technical

1690
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,039
understanding for example user

1691
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,359
enumeration now sometimes what happens

1692
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,240
is there is just this much

1693
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,240
the application responded with a verbose

1694
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,760
error message

1695
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,920
and they mentioned the message here when

1696
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
an invalid email address was provided in

1697
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,119
the username field and the screenshot

1698
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,559
just that's it and this is username

1699
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,079
minimization

1700
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,000
so don't assume that the reader will

1701
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,640
understand what the real issue was

1702
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,799
now in such case you could have also

1703
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,480
provided a poc for valid email address

1704
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,359
like when there are invalid entries

1705
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,119
submitted

1706
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,799
the server responds like this and when

1707
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,720
they are valid the server responds in a

1708
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,920
different way

1709
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,799
so by these differing responses is what

1710
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,799
we realized that we could determine

1711
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,720
valid and invalid usernames of an

1712
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,480
application

1713
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,720
so don't assume that the reader will

1714
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,480
understand just because you understood

1715
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,160
so this is one point

1716
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,960
where

1717
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,280
people skip steps

1718
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,680
and this is like

1719
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,000
not simple

1720
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,240
so you can elaborate

1721
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,799
so that if the reviewer suggests that

1722
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,559
you can merge like i said

1723
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,400
then go for merging but from your part

1724
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,160
as a first writer go as deep as possible

1725
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,200
lack of

1726
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,280
completeness again going against

1727
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,119
simplicity lack of a screen shot

1728
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,839
suppose you have directly talked about

1729
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,799
step number three from i don't suppose

1730
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,559
and that's the only screenshot in

1731
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,920
between and there are no screenshots

1732
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,720
so

1733
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,960
you know images

1734
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,280
enhance the reader's understanding and

1735
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,160
if there are if your steps of or if the

1736
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,799
images are abruptly ending see even

1737
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,160
without descriptive lines the poc the

1738
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,480
images in itself should be

1739
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,079
somewhere enough

1740
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,160
to foreign

1741
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,839
for anybody who's going to reproduce the

1742
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,680
issue for them it's easier it should be

1743
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,960
easy for them

1744
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,680
so a missing screenshot is definitely

1745
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,760
not a good sign ensure you are giving

1746
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,440
screenshots for all the steps

1747
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,440
because even without sentences the

1748
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,280
screenshots in itself should be

1749
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,480
sufficient to some extent

1750
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,720
then we have half knowledge if we are

1751
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,400
talking about extreme options and

1752
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,839
missing headers but we are not talking

1753
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,160
about click checking

1754
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,559
and your remediation talks about click

1755
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,200
jacking okay so the finding is missing

1756
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,880
security headers and your remediation

1757
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,960
is reused and it has mentions of click

1758
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,880
checking and you're just half talking

1759
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,880
about extreme options being

1760
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,799
misconfigured

1761
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,400
so you ensure that you are checking

1762
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,319
everything and if you're talking about

1763
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,520
something

1764
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,880
that can also lead to another

1765
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,720
vulnerability then ensure you have

1766
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,359
mentions of those because these are some

1767
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,960
things that

1768
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,839
some other tester

1769
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,760
might mention in their reports so then

1770
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,280
what happens is

1771
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,359
you are like

1772
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,200
it seems that you have not done the

1773
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,640
testing completely there's something

1774
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,720
missing it's immediately highlighted

1775
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,599
so read the descriptions whatever is

1776
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,000
coming automatically ensure that

1777
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,599
if there are mentions you have a note

1778
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,640
around it

1779
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,880
suppose extreme options were not was not

1780
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,240
correctly configured and it was not

1781
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,400
vulnerable to click checking also

1782
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,280
so in such situations add a note

1783
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,680
that though this was there this was

1784
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,440
tested but it was not vulnerable to

1785
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,280
click checking so something of this sort

1786
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,079
make your vulnerability wholesome and

1787
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,720
ensure that there are checks

1788
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,240
related to other vulnerabilities which

1789
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,720
can arise from the base vulnerability

1790
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,640
awkward transitions if there are

1791
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,400
chaining of attacks

1792
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,119
and if you have ended something

1793
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,200
like

1794
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,920
using username enumeration you got valid

1795
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,799
usernames and now you're moving towards

1796
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,559
brute force because there is also weak

1797
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,240
password policy so there are chances

1798
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,880
that using the valid email address you

1799
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,640
can easily crack

1800
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,720
maybe a user's password and get through

1801
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,880
so when you are transitioning from user

1802
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,880
name enumeration to insufficient

1803
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,640
anti-automation or lack of rate limiting

1804
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,079
or brute force

1805
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,039
or even

1806
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,880
mentioning about weak password policies

1807
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,359
so there should be a systematic flow in

1808
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,680
this again you can use mind maps that

1809
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,359
first this happened

1810
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,640
and then you

1811
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,400
realized that there was a weak password

1812
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,079
policy so you should be checking about

1813
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,160
this as well

1814
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,760
so ensure that the transitions are

1815
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,039
smooth

1816
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,960
and again you don't miss out on anything

1817
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,559
because then it can get complicated for

1818
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,920
the readers

1819
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,240
wrong choice of words now sometimes

1820
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,079
discovery is fine

1821
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,720
like username discovery no so then

1822
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,319
username elimination because you could

1823
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,640
enumerate the list of those directories

1824
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,720
or usernames and some things you

1825
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,480
discover so choice of words is also

1826
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,400
important when you say a particular

1827
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,160
issue was exploited then ensure that it

1828
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,640
was actually exploited and not just

1829
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,640
simply confirmed

1830
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,160
confirmed and exploited again that's a

1831
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,359
different topic so choice of words is

1832
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,680
also important what you are saying

1833
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,760
and if you recollect the basic points

1834
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,280
the immediate takeaways that we talked

1835
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,400
about

1836
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,319
now those should not be a part of common

1837
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,880
mistakes come on so getting a tool name

1838
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,000
wrong everything this happens

1839
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,559
but these are some really important

1840
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,720
mistakes which we have highlighted

1841
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,359
and now that you know of the

1842
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,440
immediate takeaways

1843
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,640
ensure that those mistakes are not

1844
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,879
repeated by you in your pen test report

1845
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,600
now reviews reviewing is a very

1846
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,560
important part of

1847
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,040
reporting reporting process

1848
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,479
now when you invest a lot of time in

1849
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,679
your report

1850
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,679
sometimes you may not find mistakes in

1851
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,719
it but when a person freshly sees it the

1852
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,520
power of peer review is tremendous

1853
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,439
so when someone freshly sees it he will

1854
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,520
immediately catch errors be technical be

1855
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,399
it language-wise so reviews are really

1856
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,600
important

1857
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,759
and reviews take time there should be

1858
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,920
someone who is dedicated to this work

1859
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,600
that they are reviewing your reports

1860
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,960
this will help you this will give you

1861
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,279
really good insights so ensure you get

1862
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,880
your report reviewed before you send it

1863
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,158
to the client

1864
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,000
keep a checklist from all the points

1865
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,799
that we have gathered make a checklist

1866
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,359
and if you are doing a self review then

1867
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,279
ensure that there is a there is a huge

1868
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,359
gap of time between when you complete

1869
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,359
the report and when you are reviewing it

1870
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,000
so that you also review it with a fresh

1871
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,040
mind

1872
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,799
so this is

1873
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,479
important reviewing is important

1874
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,359
training uh report writing is an

1875
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,000
essential element of practice for all

1876
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,439
professions

1877
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,880
anybody who wants to improve their level

1878
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,439
of skills must seek specialist training

1879
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,920
in these areas in addition to obvious

1880
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,158
advances within the profession

1881
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,759
communication skills are important and

1882
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,520
if you feel you want to do upgrade

1883
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,080
yourself if you feel now that you have

1884
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,839
the required technical skill sets and

1885
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,198
you are doing good

1886
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,040
then you may want to move towards

1887
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,040
improving your communication skills and

1888
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,520
if you think you need guidance then

1889
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,399
definitely take trainings because like

1890
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,560
we said in all professions communication

1891
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,080
skills and the core skill sets

1892
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,600
balance is the key and both are

1893
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,280
important so think about getting trained

1894
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,719
and this was one question would you

1895
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,640
rather so yes

1896
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,320
people prefer pen testers with pen

1897
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,239
testing skills and communication skills

1898
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,520
even if a tester is extremely good

1899
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,440
even if they hire them they will have to

1900
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,920
train that person so

1901
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,800
yes all this matters

1902
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,640
and the conclusion if you have to

1903
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,800
summarize everything reporting is a part

1904
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,760
of pentest an important part of pentest

1905
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,199
technical writing

1906
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:33,280
is simple and evocative it is emotional

1907
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,040
proof of concept section is the heart of

1908
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,280
a pentest report where which cannot be

1909
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,199
automated and this is where your real

1910
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,040
storytelling skills come into the

1911
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,239
picture

1912
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,120
use creativity like mind maps doodling

1913
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,800
and frame sentences easily around it

1914
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,560
and reviewing is important because it

1915
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,480
will give you more ideas and proper

1916
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,239
inputs

1917
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,719
so yes this was

1918
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,880
all from my end about reporting in

1919
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,560
penetration testing

1920
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,719
thank you so much for joining in thank

1921
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,600
you
