1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,799
do

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,960
i went and i asked about 100 to 150

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,040
other consultants and a lot of my

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,120
friends our consultant said hey how do

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
you get clients

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,040
how do you figure out pricing how does

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,440
consulting work for you

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
so we talk about getting started with

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,560
consulting this is really the summation

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,119
of not just my experience but

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,080
let's say a couple hundred of my friends

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
and acquaintances as well

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
so let's talk about the dream

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,760
and there's a lot of truth here

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
consultants are rock stars they travel

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
the world pandemic willing our

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
world-class experts do meaningful work

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
have lots of freedom and are extremely

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
highly paid and there's a lot of truth

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,280
there for sure

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,719
reality lots of deadlines i have three

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,239
deadlines today

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,480
you don't have a boss you have multiple

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,039
bosses multiple clients

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,640
people talk about the feast and famine

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,239
of consulting you have a lot of work

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,680
then you don't have any then you have a

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,239
lot and so forth it's not all exciting

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,920
work i don't love writing reports i

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
don't love writing proposals i don't

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
mind i do it

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
um i travel a lot now a large extent

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
because i choose to when i do but

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
you know my last flight and i've only

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
had a few since the pandemic started

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
i came so close to being stranded both

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,000
going

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
because of a hurricane between me and

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,680
virginia beach

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
and

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
i almost got stranded coming back in dc

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
and dc's fine but dulles airport is is

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
dull

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
so

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,759
let's just start from the beginning

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,079
what's a consultant because people

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,479
confuse this first of all we all know

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640
what an employee is right you have a job

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
you work for one organization hopefully

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
you love it i'm not anti-job i loved my

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
first job absolutely

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,159
contractor is not the same as consultant

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,719
most contractors

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,119
work for one employer

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,159
and they might have different

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,320
remuneration or financial terms but

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,199
you're paid for your time so friend of

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
mine had a job for

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,879
well over a decade

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,000
he was laid off he came back literally

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,920
the next day as a contractor same desk

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
same co-workers same work

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
he's not a consultant you may use that

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
term if you'd like he's a contractor

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
consultant

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
typically with a consultant you have

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
multiple clients

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
so this year alone i think i've worked

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
for five different clients if i go and i

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
list them out in my mind one hasn't paid

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
me yet but that's happening

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,599
you have a lot more control you can say

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,720
no i turned down something just last

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
week it wasn't the right thing for me

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
and ideally you're paid for results

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
right you're not paid for your time

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
ideally you're paid for results now

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,599
usually there's some kind of mix here

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,640
now

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
granted there is some overlap between

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,680
these three there's employees that

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
consult on the side

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
consultants sometimes take contracts and

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
so forth

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,599
but they are different

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
we talk about consulting models

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
we're going to talk about being a

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
full-time independent consulting as well

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,519
as a little bit about consulting on the

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
side for sure because the same things

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
apply

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
now i remember when i started consulting

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
there was a recession going on

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,159
and people tried to talk me out of

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,599
consulting

96
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,959
and there are all these people that have

97
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,360
been laid off they're unemployed walking

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
around saying i'm a consultant hey if

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
you've never had a client

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
you really are looking for a job you're

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
not a consultant right you're unemployed

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
if you want to say consult that sounds

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
better that's perfectly cool

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
you could be a consultant working for a

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,439
consulting firm consulting firm or

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,680
consulting company number my friends do

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,640
that number my friends love doing that

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
we are not talking about that okay

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
similar skill set in many ways

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,519
but you're an employee

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,439
you could be an employee or contractor

112
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,079
who consults on the side and that's real

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,918
popular often that's a lot more popular

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,400
and common than people think often

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,880
people say well you know my my job won't

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
let me that that may or may not be true

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
okay

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
and

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
i have a lot of friends that have become

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,560
consultants

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
that then take a full-time job

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
and then maybe bounce back to consulting

123
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,199
or contracting that bounce around

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
and sometimes people have the mindset oh

125
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
that's a failed consultant they took a

126
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
full-time job but i have a number of

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
friends some pretty impressive you'd

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
know their names

129
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
who have bounced between consultant and

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,000
full-time employee or contractor they

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
don't really care what title they have

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
they're just looking for

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
exciting interesting hopefully

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,199
well-paying meaningful work

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,600
so consulting is a business and it's a

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
great business for a lot of reasons i'm

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
not going to go through all of these

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
bullets but like low full startup costs

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
right i just worked out of my house when

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,199
i began i bought a laptop

141
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,840
probably 90 profit

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
in general

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
degrees i wish i had finished my

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
doctorate that was dr demopolis right

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
but i haven't i have a bunch of

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,360
certifications

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
they really don't matter

148
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
when you have a lot of experience when

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
you have less experience

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,280
degrees and certifications matter more

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,039
in terms of licensing there's generally

152
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
no licensing required

153
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,840
one big exception for some of us

154
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
in some jurisdictions like i think the

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
state of

156
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
texas

157
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,039
and michigan to do digital forensics

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,919
work

159
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,560
you need to be a licensed professional a

160
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,800
private investigator a pi

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
a friend of mine did that it was not

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,479
that hard i had to sign something for

163
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
him saying i promise he is a good person

164
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
of good moral character and so forth but

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
generally you don't need that and

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
although not all consultants consider

167
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
themselves entrepreneurs it's a

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
relatively easy way to start

169
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,600
now the one thing that shocked me the

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
most when i started consulting

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
i didn't realize i was going to be

172
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
running a business i was like no no it's

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
like i'm like a geek i like this

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
technology stuff and

175
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
if i become a consultant i'll be able to

176
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
do exactly what i want i'll have more

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,199
freedom more choice over projects that i

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,319
pick

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
and hopefully make good money as well

180
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,600
and i did

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
but i didn't realize i was running a

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,319
business

183
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,000
you have to

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
have or acquire some business skills now

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
not everyone likes this

186
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,919
personally

187
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
i like hacking the business stuff as

188
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
much as i like hacking technology

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
but this was kind of a surprise for me

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
that i'm running a business now i have

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
to figure out how like the invoice

192
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
clients and

193
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,479
and define clients and so forth and we

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,720
are going to talk a lot about finding

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,199
clients in a little bit

196
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,639
so since you're running business you

197
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
have to start the business now when i

198
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,039
started i just said i am demopolis

199
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,479
associates

200
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
because it sounded like i should have

201
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
associates and be bigger now in fact

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,199
it's like it's me

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
i have a support staff part-time support

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
staff i do bring friends and colleagues

205
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
into projects

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,919
but i didn't file any paperwork or did

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,000
anything and this is really common

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
eventually after two years the bank

209
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
hassled me took two years

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,160
they said your check says demopolis

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
associates

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
you're ted demopolis

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
and they're they're kind of a pain in

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
the butt so i said okay what do i need

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
to do and they told me and i said you

216
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
know i think i'm gonna walk to that bank

217
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,879
down the street i walked down to another

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,240
bank and said hey will you take this

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,599
check

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
and they said sure but you're really

221
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
supposed to fill out a form called a

222
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,840
doing business as because

223
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
i'm not demopolis associates i'm ted

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
demopolis or formerly theodore james

225
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,039
demopolis in new hampshire it was 50

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
bucks right 50 bucks it was a form it

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
was trivial now in some jurisdictions

228
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
and this isn't legal advice for example

229
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
in luxembourg my friend david cecilia

230
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
when he started consulting

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
this is his quote the administrative

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
part can take up to two months with all

233
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
the papers

234
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
unofficially speaking because this is

235
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
not legal advice a lot of consultants

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
just start and then deal with the

237
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,559
paperwork and so forth later this may or

238
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
may not be legal depending on your

239
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
jurisdiction in north korea they'd

240
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,519
probably execute you

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
in luxembourg yeah probably no one would

242
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
care but i'm guessing

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
now i started as a sole proprietorship

244
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,920
that means i am my own business

245
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
now you could be a sole proprietorship

246
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,839
and use another name

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,519
i was joking that i was going to use the

248
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
name wingnut technologies but friends

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,839
talked me out of it so i went with

250
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
demopolis associates

251
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
you'd be doing business as another name

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
and still be a sole proprietorship that

253
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,680
means you are your company and your

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
company is you that's simple

255
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,920
simple is really good i love simple

256
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
the shortcoming with a sole

257
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
proprietorship the biggest one

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,120
is if your company gets in any trouble

259
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
gets sued has any liability owes any

260
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
debts and so forth well any problems

261
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
your company has are your problems

262
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,000
because you are your company

263
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
you could create a corporation

264
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,560
now the biggest reason to create a

265
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
corporation is it's a separate legal

266
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,680
entity

267
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
if the corporation has problems like

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,880
they get sued or they owe money or

269
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,720
somebody slips and

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
hurts themselves while they're doing

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
while they're visiting you it's not your

272
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
problem it's the corporation's problem

273
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
now there's something called an llc a

274
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,480
limited liability corporation this isn't

275
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
a corporation legally

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,519
this is a u.s entity by the way an llc

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
but it has that limited liability just

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,560
like a corporation technically it's not

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
a corporation

280
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
other countries have things like an llc

281
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,120
for example in germany in switzerland

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
they have a gmbh which something i can't

283
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,320
pronounce in

284
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
german

285
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
so wikipedia defines a corporation as a

286
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
company or group of people authorized to

287
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,519
act as a single entity they're legally a

288
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,880
person

289
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
and there's different kinds depending on

290
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,079
the jurisdiction a c corporation is a

291
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,120
full corporation in the us s corporation

292
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,399
is sort of like a corporation light

293
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
the biggest advantage again

294
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
limited liability there may or may not

295
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
be tax advantages

296
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
you can have multiple owners right sole

297
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
proprietorship obviously can't because

298
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
you are your own business you can't sell

299
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
part of yourself

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
and there may be you know you can issue

301
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
shot stock and do other things now what

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,320
you pick isn't critically important

303
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,760
because you can always change right you

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
can start as a sole proprietorship and

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,959
incorporate

306
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
that's simple to do or start as a sole

307
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
proprietorship and then become an llc

308
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
later

309
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,000
now a partnership may or may not be a

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
legal entity

311
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,959
there's a lot of advantages in a

312
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
partnership

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
different partners bring different

314
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,040
things to the table different

315
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
skills different contacts that may be

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,839
one of the biggest because

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,560
people you've done business with before

318
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,360
are your most likely source of clients

319
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
certainly initially

320
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
now i've been down this line before

321
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
there's enormous potential for arguments

322
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
for disputes on on everything things

323
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
you'd never think about

324
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
even if you're in a partnership with

325
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,279
someone that you've been friends since

326
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
you've been in diapers with and known

327
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,160
since then trust me i know that both

328
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
things in writing hopefully a legal

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
document but if not

330
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
an email is better than nothing right

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
you just document as best as you can

332
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,120
and i like to document what you've

333
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
agreed on and what you have not yet

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
agreed upon which which is you're not

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
going to agree on everything that's okay

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
now my personal preference is partnering

337
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,320
on specific projects and initiatives and

338
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,399
so forth but partnerships full

339
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,680
partnerships are absolutely great

340
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,040
now a few other things you're going to

341
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
need

342
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,600
you'll need some sort of digital

343
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,240
presence right you don't need a website

344
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,839
you're not going to get clients because

345
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,440
of your website it's to give you

346
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,959
credibility

347
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
good friend of mine rick berkovitz has

348
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
been a consultant working primarily in

349
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,079
the technology space a lot with security

350
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
although he's more of a chief operating

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
officer type

352
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
he's for like at least 20 years he

353
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
doesn't have a website he uses linkedin

354
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,279
as his online presence

355
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,360
you don't need office space

356
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
uh i don't have separate office space

357
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
actually i do downstairs i generally

358
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,519
work i have a separate office in my

359
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,880
apartment i generally work at the

360
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,519
kitchen table because it works for me

361
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
when i little kids

362
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,240
i rented a dedicated office just so i

363
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
could get stuff done

364
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,519
for uh

365
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,279
for about 10 years

366
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,839
business cards letters envelopes pretty

367
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,880
much

368
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
obsolete many ways some clients may care

369
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,880
i like business cards that's up to you

370
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,120
insurance can be a big deal in the us

371
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
health insurance is a big deal

372
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
some clients will require liability

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,079
insurance usually that's pretty

374
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
inexpensive

375
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,600
now

376
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
consulting is a growing field now this

377
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
is going to sound like a joke i could

378
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
just change the slides in the last year

379
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
but the past few years because i've been

380
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,720
traveling much as a

381
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
during the pandemic i've literally met

382
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,560
all these types of consultants now i

383
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,639
have no idea what a water consultant

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
does

385
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
but an infosec consultant

386
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
a lesbian dating consultant

387
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,240
and a woman that speaks with the dead

388
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,480
professionally walk into a bar right

389
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
sounds like the beginning of a stupid

390
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,959
joke this actually happened i've met

391
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,440
consultants that do all kinds of things

392
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,480
now i can't tell you that being a raw

393
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
food consultant or a cosmetic packaging

394
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
consultant is a growth field

395
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,839
i can tell you consulting in general is

396
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
definitely growing

397
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,519
you can look up metrics easily and

398
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,040
infosec consulting is very much a growth

399
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
area

400
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,279
now we tend to think that

401
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
experts

402
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
the specialists are more experts than

403
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
other people so you know who's more of

404
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
an expert a brain surgeon or a doctor

405
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,680
that does

406
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,360
general practice

407
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
you tend to think the brain surgeon

408
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
or the orthopedic surgeon that

409
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
specializes in replacing hips

410
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,639
like my father did we tend to think

411
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,160
specialists

412
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
are smarter than generalists now that's

413
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,279
not always true i called my doctor

414
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
yesterday he's in general practice he's

415
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,760
he's a brilliant guy and i literally

416
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
know a brain surgeon he's much smarter

417
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
than the brain surgeon

418
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
however you do need to specialize now

419
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,839
when i started just saying you're an

420
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,720
infosec was

421
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
totally a real specialization it isn't

422
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,880
now

423
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
you could specialize in verticals

424
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
so later today i'm hopefully sitting in

425
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
a talk by a friend of mine who

426
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
specializes in security for small

427
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
business it's it's what he's into it's

428
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
what he loves doing

429
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,360
i know another consultant in infosec my

430
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
friend doc blackburn he does a lot in

431
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
health care right he does a lot in

432
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,320
health care

433
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
or it could be my specialty i am a pen

434
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,519
tester or i'm this kind of a pen tester

435
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,600
or i do strategic security planning i do

436
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,120
a fair amount of that

437
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,880
i have some friends that they specialize

438
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
they do cell phone forensics one of them

439
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,519
does only iphone forensics or you could

440
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,839
specialize in both now what you

441
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,000
specialize in doesn't need to limit you

442
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,839
but i have clients that have hired me

443
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
for one thing

444
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,759
and that dragged me into other projects

445
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,279
often happily

446
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,120
i once got hired somewhere to assess how

447
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,920
good the knowledge of their customer

448
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
facing security people were the big

449
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
networking company you know them and uh

450
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,519
they ended up dragging me into corporate

451
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,040
restructuring for fortune 500 can be

452
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
like well i don't know anything about

453
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
this it's like that's why we want you to

454
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
help you don't have any preconceptions

455
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,639
and you're a smart person

456
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,880
so you need to specialize in something

457
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,600
right but you may end up doing things

458
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
all over the place and commonly will

459
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,880
now the second most common question that

460
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,399
i get

461
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,160
is on pricing the first is on getting

462
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
clients so let's talk about pricing

463
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
man we could talk about pricing for like

464
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,839
hours probably there's entire classes

465
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,240
like you know graduate level classes on

466
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,280
pricing

467
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,720
people have their phds and arcane

468
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,400
areas of pricing theory and so forth but

469
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,520
guess what

470
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,640
pricing is so easy for consultants it

471
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,039
really is most of it is real easy

472
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
so there's a concept of market-based

473
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,240
pricing

474
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,720
so my daughter's actually texting me as

475
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,679
i'm here

476
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
and i'm assuming she's reminding me she

477
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
wants me to buy her some blueberries

478
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,039
okay what do blueberries cost

479
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
well what's the market price i can tell

480
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
you i think they're in season now i

481
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
think they're finishing the harvest in

482
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,520
maine

483
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
think they're in seasons or prices are a

484
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
little low what do they cost well it'll

485
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,160
be a range from low to high if i buy it

486
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
at market basket one of my favorite

487
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
supermarket it's going to be relatively

488
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,480
low if i go buy organic at whole foods

489
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
and a new one opened up here it's going

490
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
to be more expensive but it'll be a

491
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,679
range

492
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
right we might say so what's a plumber

493
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
in des moines cost

494
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
you can google this okay these are the

495
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
rough hourly rates

496
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,760
and you know if a plumber has

497
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,559
less experience or maybe less of a

498
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
less of a good reputation they'll charge

499
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
closer to the bottom

500
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
of that range if they have a better

501
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
reputation maybe a lot of experience

502
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,120
he'll judge closer to the high end what

503
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
if somebody charges way lower i knew a

504
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
plumber unfortunately he's passed away

505
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
he was charging 25 bucks an hour

506
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
in scarborough it's like 25 bucks an

507
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,000
hour like plumbers in scarborough charge

508
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
more what's wrong there was something

509
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,039
wrong with him

510
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,000
he was a very good plumber when he was

511
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
sober

512
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
when he was sober

513
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,039
uh

514
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,200
someone that knows him well said they

515
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,559
had seen him sober twice in their life

516
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,679
so yeah you might say i'll charge less

517
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,760
so i can get started and that may or may

518
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
not work but if someone charges way less

519
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
things like why are they charging less

520
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
you know is there something wrong with

521
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,559
them

522
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
and so forth

523
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,679
now

524
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,520
you can also have fixed rates right

525
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,080
fixed rates based on projects now fixed

526
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,960
rates can be great it can be scary when

527
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
you have a fixed rate because what if it

528
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,240
takes you longer or more resources right

529
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,520
you can lose money on fixed rate bidding

530
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
uh fixed rate projects you can also do

531
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,240
real well generally for fixed rate i

532
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,039
will figure out the hourly what how many

533
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
hours i think it's going to take in any

534
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,160
other resources

535
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,679
and i will literally double the cost you

536
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,960
know why

537
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,600
two reasons two big reasons first don't

538
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
projects normally take longer than you

539
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
think they're going to like yeah almost

540
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
always

541
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
and secondly you're taking on more risk

542
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
right by having a fixed rate

543
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
so you deserve more potential reward

544
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
well this is for plumbers

545
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
okay

546
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
and this is a daily or hourly rate

547
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
there's other ways you mentioned project

548
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,559
based you can also have retainers

549
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,960
retainers are paid in advance for work

550
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
uh there's other considerations

551
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,080
geography for example i know incident

552
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,559
handlers in the uk

553
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,039
get paid less than they do in the us why

554
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,559
i don't know but i know they get paid

555
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,760
less there

556
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,559
also clients fixed rates

557
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
uh of my 30 i think it's 31 years now of

558
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,799
consulting most years i've had at least

559
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,200
one major client that paid a fixed rate

560
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,159
this is what we pay this makes it simple

561
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,480
now fixed rates are usually fair or you

562
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,760
don't take them

563
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,320
when i first started consulting in 1990

564
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,159
i had a client they paid two different

565
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,559
fixed rates for things that i did

566
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,679
the

567
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,679
thing i did the most often they paid

568
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
1200 a day okay it was like 1990

569
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,200
i was a lot younger i didn't have a

570
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
mortgage i didn't have kids

571
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
like 1200

572
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
to do something i thought was fun take

573
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,600
it or leave it was like take it you know

574
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
they're often very fair

575
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,280
now

576
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,360
let's translate this to infosec okay you

577
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,200
cannot easily google prices for like an

578
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
iphone

579
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,440
app

580
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,000
pen testing consultant

581
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
not as easily as let's say performers in

582
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
des moines or

583
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,679
roofers in seattle or something like

584
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,559
that

585
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,240
you may be able to find some information

586
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
if you look online and talk to some

587
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,600
people do some osint but it's not as

588
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,039
easy let's say plumbers or trades people

589
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,000
here's

590
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,240
a model i came up with this there's no

591
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,919
magic here

592
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,039
take your current job salary and by by

593
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,039
the way job salaries are easy to look up

594
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,600
online let's just pick round numbers say

595
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,960
you're making a hundred thousand dollars

596
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
a year or 100 000 euros

597
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,960
and you work 2 000 hours a year

598
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,600
right i know most of us a lot of us work

599
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
a lot more than that

600
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,840
so that's about 2 000 hours by 50 weeks

601
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,159
at 40 hours in europe people say oh

602
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,760
that's too much work in the u.s we're

603
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
probably saying oh i work more than that

604
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
and then just figure out just divide

605
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
that's 50 bucks an hour you have to at

606
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,720
least double that at least why

607
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,799
you don't have benefits

608
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,280
healthcare in the u.s paid vacation

609
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,559
they're not going to be sending you to

610
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,400
conferences you know they're not going

611
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
to be buying you computers

612
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
now some people would say you should at

613
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,280
least

614
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
triple that

615
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,679
right so at least double just judge at

616
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
least 100

617
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,880
an hour or 800 a day bare minimum

618
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
you're not going to be working 2 000

619
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
hours a week by the way or 2 000 hours a

620
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,080
year

621
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
yeah i've done it some years but it's

622
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,120
not common it's just just to get like an

623
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,840
idea of where you should be it is

624
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,679
absolute minimum

625
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,760
now can you charge

626
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,559
more than market-based pricing

627
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,320
right the formula i showed you is to get

628
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,120
an idea of market-based pricing

629
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,640
yeah you can

630
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,039
now of course it's not just about money

631
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,320
and quite bluntly i have never focused

632
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
on maximizing income

633
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
money matters it matters a lot it

634
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,039
matters maybe more to me than you i'm

635
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
gonna have three kids in college next

636
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
year plus i have expensive tastes i can

637
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
sit on the beach and do nothing and

638
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,919
spend no money and be happy

639
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,720
or i can like travel in europe and drink

640
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
expensive champagne and have a lot of

641
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,760
fun too i have big expenses

642
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
you know so money matters

643
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,720
one

644
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,120
if you're considered an absolute rock

645
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,880
star in the field

646
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,360
so let's say i needed a

647
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,559
chief

648
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,559
uh information security offers officer c

649

660
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,760
cesar or full-time or part-time or

661
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,480
whatever term you want to use

662
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
they don't care what market-based

663
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,840
pricing they don't care what the market

664
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,039
rate is

665
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,600
first of all i need to excite them as

666
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
they say dude you should come do this

667
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
this is going to be a lot of fun we're

668
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,159
doing some great stuff

669
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,640
and i need to pay them what they ask

670
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,480
right they don't care what

671
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,320
joe blow the most excellent

672
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,679
middle-of-the-range csos charging he may

673
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,600
be great but it's like

674
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
and you got the experience you know

675
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,559
you've got the name and so forth

676
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,799
another reason you may be able to charge

677
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,799
more than marketplace pricing

678
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,720
in every field

679
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
there are some people that want a

680
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
premium experience or product

681
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
i don't care whether it's infosec

682
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
or

683
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,240
baking cakes

684
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,279
or

685
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,720
yoga

686
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,799
or anything like that

687
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,000
so

688
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
a little before the pandemic a friend of

689
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,159
mine much younger friend of mine went to

690
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,120
see some some hip-hop concert

691
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,440
uh i like some hip-hop i didn't think

692
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
this person was particularly talented or

693
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,559
amusing

694
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
and the ticket i can't remember what the

695
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,240
ticket was it was like they could get a

696
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
ticket for it was like under 80 bucks

697
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
right to go see it

698
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,400
you could also pay for a better ticket

699
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
you get a better seat they also had a

700
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
package that was like it was over a

701
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
thousand dollars

702
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,080
where they picked you up in a limo they

703
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
drove you you get to go backstage just

704
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,679
for a little bit of time you didn't get

705
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,360
to meet the band or anything now in

706
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,559
either case

707
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,080
you got to go see the concert right

708
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
some people want that premium experience

709
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,640
and it might not even really be that

710
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,279
significantly better so let's make this

711
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,720
concrete

712
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
i have a friend named cara

713
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,440
cara decorates cakes okay she's into

714
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,159
cake decorating

715
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,799
it's her passion and she teaches people

716
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,960
how to decorate cakes like okay

717
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
decorating cakes like they're people

718
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
that do that professionally and you know

719
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,400
there's some awesome bakeries and bakers

720
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,760
and

721
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,120
she doesn't work with them she works

722
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,000
with

723
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,640
primarily women as she put it

724
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,360
her her marketplace primarily housewives

725
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
primarily women

726
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,120
at home

727
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
they may or may not have a job they're

728
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
they're around her age they're just

729
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,799
decorating cakes because they like it

730
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,120
they they love doing it she has a few

731
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,840
men but very few

732
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,000
okay she decided she was going to hold

733
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
an event at her house

734
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
you can come hang out with her for the

735
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,520
weekend

736
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,760
and decorate cakes not just you you and

737
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,279
like i think she had 10 people or

738
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,840
something like that or she capped it at

739
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,120
10. she charged

740
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,279
12 000

741
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,360
to come hang out with her at her house

742
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
and decorate cakes for a weekend right

743
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,640
crazy right guess what she sold out some

744
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
people always want that premium

745
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,880
experience or product

746
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,360
third reason the results are critical

747
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,159
right even a slight perceived

748
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,080
improvement is worth a lot

749
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
you can keep the ceo out of jail the ceo

750
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,120
doesn't care what you charge maybe

751
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
you're just a little bit better than

752
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
someone else they'll pay a lot more or

753
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,520
maybe you can save a life i had a health

754
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
scare not too long ago

755
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
right turned up wasn't anything

756
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
significant

757
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,960
uh i didn't care what the doctor charged

758
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,799
you know i didn't care if insurance

759
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,559
covered it it was like if this might

760
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,799
save my life

761
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,480
i don't care i want the best

762
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
now

763
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
i don't like writing proposals i think i

764
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
already mentioned this before

765
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,080
as a consultant you have a lot of

766
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
freedom

767
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,440
um sometimes a proposal is necessary

768
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,760
okay a formal or informal proposal

769
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
if i write a proposal i don't care if

770
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,679
it's formal or informal

771
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,080
i want it to be a formality okay i'm not

772
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,279
gonna answer a request for proposals on

773
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,559
rfp

774
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,640
unless they really want me to i need to

775
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,679
be invited like we really want you to do

776
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,880
this and i still might not

777
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
generally

778
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
i want to already have an agreement with

779
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,279
the person to do the work with like

780
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,840
we've already come to it was a

781
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,679
conceptual agreement

782
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,600
yeah this is what they want done i can

783
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
do this we're going to do it this way we

784
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,039
talk back and forth we've got a

785
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,520
conceptual agreement and i i simply

786
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,279
document it if we don't have a

787
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,440
conceptual agreement i've just talked to

788
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
somebody about doing something like send

789
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
me a proposal

790
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,240
i find they're usually just trying to

791
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
get rid of you it's like okay yeah send

792
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
me a proposal maybe i'll look at it

793
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,919
maybe i'll think about it the ideal

794
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,080
proposal is just a formality you've

795
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,840
already got conceptual agreement doesn't

796
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,960
mean you're necessarily going to get the

797
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,720
work but you've got a very good chance

798
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,679
if it's not a formality and even usually

799
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,200
when it is you want multiple options

800
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
right multiple chances for the person to

801
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,440
say yes

802
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,120
what if a proposal just says this is

803
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,559
what i propose well it's yes no or

804
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
ignore which is no

805
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,600
i like three choices

806
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
the medium choice this is what we talked

807
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
about this is what i think we should do

808
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,240
this is what makes sense

809
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,520
a low option saying this is the minimum

810
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
i think you should do you know whether i

811
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,760
do it for you or not i really just do at

812
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
least this

813
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,120
and then a high one a in a perfect world

814
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,039
this is what we should do this would be

815
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,120
awesome this would be great in a perfect

816
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,360
world but we're not a perfect world and

817
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
you know we have limited resources but

818
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
in a perfect world

819
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,480
now they usually go for the medium

820
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,440
high maybe two percent of the time

821
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,120
uh do not

822
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,760
put anything any high level in a

823
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
proposal unless you can actually deliver

824
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,039
it because it gets chosen sometimes

825
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,679
a few years back i spent seven weeks in

826
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,960
abu dhabi abu dhabi's nice enough place

827
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,679
it's very pretty i was on the beach you

828
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
know

829
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,039
which is of limited use when you're

830
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,080
working but uh it's because somebody had

831
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
a high proposal

832
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,880
had a high level in a proposal and i was

833
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,960
part of it and i didn't want to spend

834
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,120
seven weeks in abu dhabi

835
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
right so make sure you can deliver it it

836
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,960
was well paid it was great work i'm not

837
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
complaining

838
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
but it's basic psychology right multiple

839
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,879
chances to say yes

840
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,399
now

841
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,480
there's going to be a price

842
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,919
right like what you're charging we

843
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,679
talked about pricing

844
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,360
now this is going to sound a little odd

845
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,760
first of all i will i will help people

846
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,000
for free i will talk to essentially

847
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,279
anybody

848
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,720
right at some point i'll tell it's like

849
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,039
hey look you know i consult as a living

850
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,360
we're crossing the line to like paid

851
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,600
services glad to talk to you for half an

852
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,080
hour or whatever

853
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,399
but we're crossing the line to paid

854
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,799
consulting let's talk about how we can

855
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,559
work together

856
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,799
sometimes there's no negotiations that

857
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,640
are necessary in price and by the way

858
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
often the word negotiate is not used at

859
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,720
all at all

860
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,399
but the basic rule is you don't

861
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,320
negotiate on price

862
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
you're not selling used cars right

863
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
you're not selling used camels you're

864
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
not selling really you're a professional

865
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,559
you negotiate on value if they're like i

866
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,880
like that middle level in your proposal

867
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,360
but it's a little too expensive you know

868
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,399
you want a hundred thousand we have 85

869
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,360
000 in the budget

870
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,039
well you might say okay

871
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,279
well for eighty five thousand dollars

872
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,080
this is what i can do right you remove

873
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,399
some of the deliverables

874
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,880
say okay maybe the final report you will

875
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,360
write the final report for the project

876
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,279
and i will review it

877
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,559
or will leave this part out

878
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,799
if you concede on price

879
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,120
they have to concede on something too

880
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
right if you're fighting on price

881
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,159
something's wrong right you're like

882
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,880
acting like walmart

883
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,720
and uh you know walmart competes on

884
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,320
price and they're very good at that you

885
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,840
don't want to compete in price you want

886
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,120
to compete on value you want to be a

887
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
great deal

888
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,880
you definitely want to be a great deal

889
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,799
you don't want to be cheap though now

890
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,159
that said

891
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,799
every year i'll i might do one or two

892
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,880
things for free i've done some work for

893
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,799
like for free for charities and good

894
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,120
causes and so forth we're like you can't

895
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,679
pay me okay i'll do it just to help out

896
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
i've done this with some really good

897
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
clients as well that have paid me well

898
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
and there's like a project

899
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
usually a small thing that means a lot

900
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
to the buyer who's usually become a

901
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,039
friend and

902
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,640
they'll be

903
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,919
you know this is all we have in the

904
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,600
budget it's like that's not enough money

905
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,760
i can't just i'll just do it for you

906
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
it's like i'll do it to help up and they

907
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,080
usually need to pay you anyway

908
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,919
now a lot of clients a lot of

909
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,559
consultants start with a bang

910
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
and then after a few years

911
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,679
their contacts dry up

912
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,080
this is really common

913
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,480
they start very successfully because

914
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,399
you've already got work lined up and so

915
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
forth then it just kind of fades away

916
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,840
you need to keep a steady stream of

917
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
potential work coming in we talk about

918
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
having potential new or re-engaged

919
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,640
clients in the pipeline that's the term

920
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,399
that's used

921
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,200
if you do that right you're not you're

922
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
hopefully going to avoid this feast and

923
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,960
famine cycle where like you got lots of

924
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,040
great paying work you can't imagine ever

925
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,520
not being busy life is good maybe you

926
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,800
don't sleep enough you don't take enough

927
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
time but you're doing exciting stuff

928
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,520
it's awesome

929
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
then you finish the work

930
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,040
you haven't been doing anything

931
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
to acquire any new work or to be visible

932
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,960
to others

933
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,320
and all of a sudden you have a slow

934
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,639
period you can't remember back when you

935
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,320
were busy

936
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
well

937
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,839
you need a steady stream of clients so

938
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,440
let's talk about ways to get clients

939
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,800
okay

940
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,639
lots of different ways

941
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,599
now

942
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,960
the most

943
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,918
common people to hire you most likely

944
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,399
people to hire you are quite literally

945
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,359
people you've worked with before

946
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,918
there is risk in someone hiring you

947
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,680
whether it's full-time or as a

948
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,240
consultant or there's risk

949
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,520
there's less risk if they've worked with

950
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,560
you before

951
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,480
so you've worked with others before

952
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,960
right it's so easy to find people these

953
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
days like on linkedin and so other

954
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,920
social media and online it was harder

955
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,760
when i started so who have you worked

956
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
with like where are they now just

957
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,520
contact them

958
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,119
tell them you're gonna start consulting

959
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,280
even if you're not sure just reach out

960
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
say hey how you doing great touch bases

961
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,440
let's let you know or talk for a few

962
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,119
minutes or what's up or something like

963
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,079
that

964
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,160
my first client

965
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,680
was a company a

966
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,599
industry consortium called the open

967
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,440
software foundation

968
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,920
and literally people i worked with

969
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,560
hewlett-packard had gone to work there

970
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,400
so people i had been working with like a

971
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,359
few months before

972
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,520
you know if i take a look

973
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,839
at my first three clients my second

974
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,160
client was motorola

975
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
and i had worked with them before

976
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,320
as part of my first job

977
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,400
right i had worked for them and they

978
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
needed some consulting they needed some

979
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,560
help they knew i was consulting they

980
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,400
knew how to contact me because i touched

981
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,440
bases with them they hired me

982
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,680
my third client was actually

983
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,599
julie packard my previous employee this

984
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,680
one shocked me they reached out to me

985
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
and trust me i was not the ideal

986
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,400
employee at all i wasn't bad i was a

987
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,599
pretty good employee i just didn't fit

988
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,040
the mold it wasn't the right place for

989
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,760
me to be forever

990
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,520
so people you've worked with before

991
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,560
they're your biggest source of clients

992
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,240
at least initially and also in the

993
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
longer term and people move from company

994
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,560
to company which is awesome

995
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,640
secondly referral

996
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,280
trusted party referring another trusted

997
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
party a friend in producing a friend

998
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,400
right you ask for referrals

999
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,440
uh

1000
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,160
in most of my big clients i've had

1001
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
internal referrals

1002
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,079
yeah i've asked

1003
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,839
hey if there's anywhere else here anyone

1004
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,160
else i can help here let me know or if

1005
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,440
there's anywhere else i can provide

1006
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,640
value or

1007
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,280
introduce me to people and so forth

1008
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,760
and i usually do this when i'm most of

1009
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,520
the way through a project and it's not

1010
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,599
done yet but it's looking good

1011
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,520
you can also ask for referrals people

1012
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,960
you've worked with before you're not

1013
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
working for now it's like i'm starting

1014
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,680
to consult

1015
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,760
hey this is what i'm doing what's up

1016
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
with you you know if there's anyone i

1017
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
can help let me know introduce us

1018
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,760
your local community right your

1019
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,119
accountant your doctor your attorney now

1020
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,040
in your local community i don't suggest

1021
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
going out of your way to do this

1022
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
but just when you normally see your

1023
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,560
doctor say hey doc

1024
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,839
you know what i do you know i'm an

1025
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,320
information security consultant or i do

1026
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,920
cyber security or whatever term you

1027
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
think is going to resonate with them if

1028
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,520
there's anyone you know that i can help

1029
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,040
let them know now i'm probably talking

1030
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
to my attorney in the next probably two

1031
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,760
three weeks i'll remind them

1032
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
that you know i do some expert witness

1033
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,960
work in in you know in security

1034
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,800
if anyone i can help you know and

1035
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,640
introduce me it probably won't work for

1036
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,119
them directly because they do family law

1037
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,000
and

1038
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,720
i'm not getting involved in family law

1039
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,520
and

1040
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,200
cyber security most likely

1041
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,920
third now this is an easy one this one

1042
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,839
takes longer though volunteering

1043
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,920
there are so many

1044
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,000
organizations out there that are looking

1045
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
for volunteers

1046
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
right

1047
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,720
beside charlotte was probably looking

1048
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,320
for volunteers not too long ago might

1049
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,760
still be i know i just saw something

1050
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,599
from brucon

1051
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,000
uh in belgium actually they're they're

1052
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
in belgium that's great conference they

1053
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,720
were looking for volunteers actually

1054
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,800
tweeting this out

1055
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
as a volunteer

1056
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
even if you have very little experience

1057
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,480
you're going to meet and interact with

1058
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
some pretty senior people right you're

1059
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,520
interacting with them as peers

1060
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,200
you now work for them even though you're

1061
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,880
working as a volunteer right they

1062
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,760
qualify as people you've worked with

1063
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,000
and they're more likely to hire you now

1064
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
right i suggest volunteering for more

1065
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,079
than a year

1066
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,000
right also saying i've worked with you

1067
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,560
know beside charlotte or defcon or

1068
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,760
brewcon or adds a lot of credibility

1069
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,000
now admittedly

1070
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,599
i've done

1071
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,920
less of this than i could part because

1072
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,320
of my busy travel schedule and i still

1073
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,000
have three teenagers it's easier than

1074
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,680
when they were smaller

1075
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,599
but for example there's an infosec group

1076
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,720
in maine

1077
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
and it doesn't make sense for me to

1078
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,240
volunteer to be some sort of an officer

1079
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,079
or something like that because because i

1080
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,520
travel traditionally you can't make a

1081
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,119
lot of the meetings

1082
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,599
but when they had a cissp study group i

1083
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,040
said well what can i do to help it's

1084
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
like i could do a two or three hour

1085
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,599
session on crypto for people taking the

1086
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
cissp exam

1087
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
i can do that there's other

1088
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,119
organizations

1089
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,720
other conferences like i can help you

1090
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,880
with marketing for this you know i know

1091
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
a little bit i can help get the word out

1092
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,680
and so forth

1093
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,480
now

1094
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,200
you can also volunteer for good causes

1095
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,280
hopefully ones you believe with you

1096
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,480
believe in

1097
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
uh

1098
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,760
this can work really well

1099
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
now it turns out in a lot of

1100
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,720
organizations in most businesses

1101
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
high-level people including executives

1102
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,359
are encouraged to volunteer

1103
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,520
and if you volunteer you're working with

1104
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,599
them as peers and they may not be able

1105
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,160
to hire you or in a position but if the

1106
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,240
boss's boss says oh we need some help

1107
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
with this go talk to ted

1108
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,319
man that that's that's a referral with

1109
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,720
enormous weight and i have had the

1110
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,400
boss's boss

1111
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,680
refer me to someone it's like there was

1112
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,560
no question on could i do it

1113
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,480
or what was i going to charge it was

1114
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,720
like can you do you have time can you

1115
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
help us

1116
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,200
uh i've done some volunteering here i've

1117
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,359
done some with special olympics for

1118
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,359
swimming in new hampshire i didn't do

1119
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,040
this because i was expecting to find any

1120
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,000
work

1121
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,520
right but i've done a little bit of this

1122
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
i will probably be doing more of this as

1123
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,839
my children are older and so forth

1124
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,800
speaking so i heard something

1125
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,960
interesting uh i was in a webinar

1126
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,760
recently and apparently the biggest fear

1127
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
that people have according to many

1128
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,599
surveys is public speaking

1129
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,319
yeah an enormous fear trust me i'm not a

1130
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,040
natural speaker i was so afraid of

1131
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,079
speaking

1132
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,839
but we can all speak

1133
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,920
we all have experiences and knowledge to

1134
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,280
share

1135
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
right and if you're a speaker you're

1136
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,839
considered to be an expert

1137
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,720
just the fact that you're speaking

1138
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,880
even if you're not very good you might

1139
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,720
have good information

1140
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
you have high visibility i absolutely

1141
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,119
get work through my speaking

1142
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,599
uh now that's one of the reasons i speak

1143
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
i speak because i enjoy it i like doing

1144
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,800
this

1145
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
now notice we're saying consultants are

1146
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,440
experts so let's talk just a second on

1147
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
this expert idea

1148
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,720
expert

1149
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,040
we're all experts i know i used to shy

1150
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,400
away from that term

1151
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
i'm not an expert

1152
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,560
expert doesn't mean number one expert in

1153
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,760
the world

1154
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,560
expert doesn't mean

1155
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,560
there's nothing else for you to learn

1156
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
experts are relative term

1157
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,119
expert just means you have valuable

1158
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,000
information that can help others

1159
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,119
and sometimes the biggest expert the one

1160
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,440
with the most expertise

1161
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,680
is not the best one to help an

1162
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,960
organization

1163
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,880
one that's closer to where they are

1164
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,640
that's a few levels above them in

1165
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,040
knowledge can be more helpful sometimes

1166
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,520
so you you are an expert right and

1167
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,800
speaking helps you give you that expert

1168
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,280
status like if you're speaking it's it's

1169
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,599
impressive right and you get high

1170
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,119
visibility

1171
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,960
i remember i gave a talk once on

1172
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,040
application security application

1173
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,319
programming and security for microsoft

1174
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,800
it was a microsoft conference in waltham

1175
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,800
massachusetts i was the last speaker

1176
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,640
on a sunday

1177
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,960
i had four people what was the three

1178
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,920
people i remember one of them was

1179
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,280
snoring really loudly in front i had

1180
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,200
three active people

1181
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,720
now those three people really wanted to

1182
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
hear what i had to say

1183
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,839
and uh

1184
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,800
it was like after it's like it's like

1185
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,240
remember telling a friend of mine who's

1186
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,079
in public relations high tech pr it's

1187
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,000
like man it's like in this talk it's

1188
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,440
like those people were there i think i

1189
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,359
helped them out but there's like almost

1190
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
nobody there and one guy was snoring

1191
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,359
he's like it doesn't matter

1192
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,040
you spoke at microsoft tell everyone

1193
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,960
that's impressive

1194
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,040
even if people don't hear you speak even

1195
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,400
i didn't like that you speak they don't

1196
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,599
like what you have to say you have

1197
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,680
different opinions or whatever

1198
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,920
the fact that you're speaking is

1199
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,000
impressive helps get clients

1200
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,040
writing

1201
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,880
now i said i was not a natural speaker

1202
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
let's talk about writing

1203
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,680
uh i always hated writing

1204
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,920
english is not my first language

1205
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,599
okay for starters

1206
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,040
my only fluent language i hated writing

1207
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
in school i was a math major you know

1208
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,079
why

1209
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,119
no papers no labs to write up

1210
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,240
i find

1211
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,520
i like

1212
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,240
to write if nobody forces me to i become

1213
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,079
a decent writer right writing's a

1214
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,200
learned skill

1215
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,880
you can learn to write reasonably i'm

1216
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,280
gonna hopefully finish my fourth book

1217
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,640
really soon

1218
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,400
uh i have a slide coming up that's

1219
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,040
saying it is at the uh

1220
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,280
at the editors and it better because i

1221
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,960
think i'm finishing it today and getting

1222
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,119
into the editor over the weekend

1223
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,119
you can learn to write just like you can

1224
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,640
learn to speak

1225
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,400
it doesn't have to be a book they can be

1226
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,240
articles and so forth there are so many

1227
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,480
things you can write they position you

1228
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,520
as an expert they give you visibility

1229
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,440
i've definitely gotten a lot of clients

1230
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,040
through writing

1231
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,880
friend of mine

1232
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,720
ken hartman wrote a paper on

1233
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,000
bitcoin

1234
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,880
excuse me on bitcoin on bittorrent and

1235
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,920
the legal aspects of bittorrent now he

1236
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,760
he's not a lawyer he had to do a lot of

1237
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,599
research he put a lot of time into that

1238
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,800
paper

1239
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,640
oh man he's tracked a lot of work to

1240
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,720
that paper a lot of expert witness and

1241
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,640
other work to this one paper that he

1242
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,960
wrote that one online

1243
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,839
now

1244
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,760
there are so many techniques you can use

1245
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,920
those are the big ones

1246
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,839
okay what techniques gonna work for you

1247
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,680
first of all i don't know what's gonna

1248
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,040
work for you

1249
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,960
you don't either so you try different

1250
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,920
things

1251
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,640
i have two friends that speak at the rsa

1252
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,720
conference every year they speak at rsa

1253
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,040
okay i've never spoken at rsa

1254
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,560
maybe i will next year who knows

1255
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,400
one of them gets

1256
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,280
new work every time he speaks at rsa he

1257
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,640
gets another client to every single time

1258
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,560
the other one he doesn't get any work he

1259
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,200
gets visibility he gets bragging rights

1260
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,800
maybe it helps him in the long term it

1261
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,640
almost certainly does

1262
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,160
i do some teaching for the sands

1263
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
institute i've been teaching for them

1264
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,240
off and on for about 18 years

1265
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
i don't get many clients from that i

1266
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,560
have a couple of friends i was talking

1267
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,040
to yesterday who also teach for sales

1268
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,960
they get most of their work through

1269
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,520
getting to sans i have friends that

1270
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,960
write and don't get any work through

1271
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,520
that i definitely get work through my

1272
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,640
writing

1273
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,240
you know

1274
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,960
now there's lots of things you can do to

1275
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
try to get work right

1276
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,040
um i don't know what's going to work for

1277
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,960
you so you try different things and see

1278
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,040
what works also something that works for

1279
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,359
you today may not work in the future

1280
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,640
friend of mine

1281
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,680
he's actually uh in infosec law he is a

1282
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
lawyer but he works in information

1283
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,560
security that's what he does

1284
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,160
he used to get a lot of work through

1285
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,599
writing and then should kind of stop

1286
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,839
working it stopped working

1287
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,880
and so he's doing other things now he's

1288
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,359
actually blogging online to do that now

1289
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,880
he's getting a lot of work from speaking

1290
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,240
now you might need some outside

1291
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,319
professional help and i don't mean like

1292
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,680
you know

1293
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
by i don't mean professional

1294
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,640
psychological help you may need that

1295
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,839
lawyers

1296
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,920
possibly expensive

1297
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,359
um

1298
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,119
usually worth it

1299
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,599
what i do with lawyers now i do pay

1300
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,839
attorneys for sure i have no problem

1301
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,119
doing that

1302
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,400
uh i have a few friends who are lawyers

1303
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
i sometimes help them out with security

1304
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,640
issues they sometimes help me out by

1305
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,599
looking at contracts and so forth so i

1306
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,640
barter

1307
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,880
my last book contract i got my cousin

1308
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
who's a very well respected lawyer it's

1309
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,280
not my cousin vinnie to review the book

1310
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,359
contract and i gave her a couple bottles

1311
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,440
of champagne it was good champagne

1312
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,960
probably would have been cheaper to hire

1313
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,559
a lawyer but

1314
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,319
i don't use bookkeeper

1315
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,559
you probably most most consultants who

1316
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,440
might

1317
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,000
cost a thousand dollars a year maybe

1318
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,680
maybe less

1319
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,000
i use an accountant for taxes

1320
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,400
i don't do my own taxes

1321
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,880
uh web and more designers

1322
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,480
i have a group of women in zimbabwe

1323
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
quite literally that i use

1324
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,480
for web design for simple technical

1325
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,960
stuff for administrative things and so

1326
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,440
forth most of us don't have design

1327
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,000
skills most of us shouldn't spend time

1328
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,760
on things we can get someone else to do

1329
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,920
for 10 bucks an hour or something like

1330
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
that and the women in zimbabwe are great

1331
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,119
and they're extremely well paid by local

1332
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,440
by local standards and

1333
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,359
i probably should use them an awful lot

1334
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,800
more because i have them on retainer i

1335
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,400
use them off and on they're always like

1336
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
you have more for me to do and i'm like

1337
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,319
yeah no no not right now but it's worth

1338
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,359
having you there for when i need you

1339
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,640
now

1340
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,280
i don't like the concept of sales just

1341
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,079
the word sales scares me i think of you

1342
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,480
know someone trying to sell me a used

1343
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,599
card

1344
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,160
that said i believe sales

1345
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,119
is

1346
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,760
an honorable profession especially when

1347
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,280
done well

1348
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,280
it's all about marketing it's related to

1349
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,359
sales sometimes people

1350
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,680
combine them together

1351
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,680
the purpose of marketing is to make

1352
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,839
basically sales superfluous so you have

1353
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,640
to talk people into buying things

1354
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,440
marketing in our case is making yourself

1355
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,720
visible

1356
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,880
in a positive way what by doing good

1357
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,520
stuff by giving talks at conferences by

1358
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,920
writing by volunteering by helping

1359
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,960
people

1360
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,119
right i'm doing videos on youtube i've

1361
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,880
sort of had a little hiatus but i'm

1362
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,640
starting them like this weekend i've

1363
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,359
actually got a couple to actually

1364
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,240
that actually to edit this weekend right

1365
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,640
i have one client one client excuse me

1366
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,880
one not one friend he was a consultant

1367
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
he's now retired

1368
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,720
we worked together in hong kong you know

1369
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,960
how he got all his clients

1370
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,800
by having lunch with people

1371
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,640
that was his marketing

1372
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,640
at least once or twice a week he'd take

1373
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,079
off he'd say hey i'm gonna go have lunch

1374
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,359
with somebody

1375
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,960
and you always invite me along i didn't

1376
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,800
go usually it was someone usually he had

1377
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
worked with before or he had met

1378
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
somewhere professionally he got all his

1379
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,920
clients

1380
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,359
through lunch his marketing was lunch

1381
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,760
right and it worked and it worked really

1382
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,440
well

1383
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,800
so you're always going to be doing

1384
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,280
something to make yourself visible

1385
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,119
in a positive way

1386
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,119
you always could be learning now it

1387
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,720
doesn't matter if you're a consultant or

1388
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,720
not but especially as a consultant

1389
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,119
rate of change has sped up a lot with a

1390
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,920
pandemic it certainly has

1391
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,520

1393

things

1412

learning is investing in yourself right

1413
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,160
i invest both time and money so since

1414
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,240
the pandemic started it's like 17 18

1415
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
months

1416
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,440
i've literally i'd have to add this up

1417
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,480
but i know it's been at least 10 classes

1418
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,760
that have taken

1419
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,000
took one class on procrastination or

1420
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,720

class on risk management in security

1422
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,319
i took one class on security operations

1423
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,800
center i took a bartending class right

1424
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,240
anything that helps you learn i took

1425
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,279
that one with my son

1426
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,160
so is consulting for you

1427
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,680
i don't know

1428
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,599
i'm so happy i started consulting you

1429
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,559
know why

1430
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,240
not because i've been successful and

1431
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,240
i've done it for 30 something years and

1432
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,680
honestly it's one of the

1433
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,480
biggest positive transformative things

1434
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,920
i've done in my life

1435
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,760
that's not why not because it worked out

1436
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,240
because i had to try it

1437
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,640
i would hate to say it's like oh you

1438
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,559
know i really wish i had tried

1439
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,280
consulting if i tried consulting and i

1440
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,119
it didn't work out maybe i couldn't get

1441
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,440
clients or maybe i just didn't like

1442
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,040
consulting or for whatever reason it

1443
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,000
didn't work out i'd be happy i tried it

1444
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,240
it's like i ran a marathon once

1445
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,960
like okay i did that i may never run one

1446
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,119
again but i did it and i'm glad i tried

1447
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:39,920
it

1448
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,680
right you could also start slowly you

1449
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,880
don't have to quit your job you can

1450
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,599
start consulting on the side

1451
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,680
right and that's often very very

1452
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,599
possible that could itself could be an

1453
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,440
entire talk it is

1454
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,680
so just real quickly some resources i've

1455
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,559
got some consulting in more videos

1456
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,040
on my infosec rockstar channel on

1457
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,200
youtube i've got more to go i don't get

1458
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,359
30 or 40.

1459
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,520
i've got to sign up successful infosec

1460
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,079
consulting it needs work but i've

1461
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,119
concentrated on getting clients right

1462
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,200
how to get clients

1463
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,800
my upcoming book

1464
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
it's a lie it says it's at the editor

1465
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,400
now but it will be by the time you see

1466
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,440
me it should be within you know 24 or 48

1467
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,960
hours i'm going to try to price the book

1468
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,520
really inexpensively too

1469
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,599
i ran a conference last year i'm going

1470
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,119
to do another one on consulting and

1471
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,119
entrepreneurial activities in infosec

1472
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,000
right free is the plan

1473
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,559
right free to attend maybe a small

1474
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,240
amount of money if you want recordings

1475
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,319
that frame my costs or something i'm not

1476
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,480
sure i'm looking for sponsors if i'm in

1477
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
twitter at ted demock.com i'm on

1478
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,480

1481
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,760
any way

1482
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,920
anyway i'm just gonna finish by saying

1483
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,599
i'm so glad i started consulting if

1484
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
you're thinking about it you should look

1485
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,520
at you should try it it may or may not

1486
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,760
be for you i seem to think everyone

1487
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,359
should be a consultant

1488
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,319
obviously that's not true

1489
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,440
but

1490
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,280
if i was suddenly

1491
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,240
70 years old or 80 years old i never

1492
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,200
tried consulting i wish i had

1493
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,800
i didn't want to be there

1494
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,640
i tried it it worked for me it would

1495
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,520
have been a success even if i decided

1496
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,920
