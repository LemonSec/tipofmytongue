1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,220
all right

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,899
uh this presentation is one that I

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,540
normally give to interns um where I work

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,059
but it has application for almost all of

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,920
it so I kind of wanted to share it with

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,199
you guys uh provide the high level

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,359
advice for being successful in the

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,340
Enterprise and adopting an Innovative

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,920
Spirit uh for those that are wondering

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,840
whether you're in the right place we

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,000
probably are this isn't a terribly

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,519
technical talk uh so please feel free to

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,800
grab a coffee and sit with us

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,840
um this is a virtual or recorded session

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,820
so if you have questions drop them into

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,860
the besides Charlotte Discord I think

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,399
we're on uh stage three I forget the

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,620
exact name of it but you'll find it uh

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,719
and I'll be around Andrew uh while all

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,280
the presentation is on so just drop

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,980
questions there with that let's start oh

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,079
wait I'm not allowed to actually say

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,120
hack in this presentation so we'll

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,559
change that to

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,699
to innovate uh from the inside yeah okay

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,500
all set let's go

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,899
disclaimers before we begin I'd like to

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,580
lay a foundation around what you can

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,799
expect from this presentation to do that

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,320
we need to start with disclaimers

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,299
some of you are just beginning your

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,580
careers others have been around for a

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,439
very long time the rest are quite

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,659
obviously somewhere in the middle if you

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,659
have spent any time at all in a decent

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,159
Enterprise environment you've been

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,340
groomed and fed a steady diet of you

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,860
know the right things uh to position you

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,439
for a great career this is an excellent

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,540
thing however

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,640
um that's not this presentation this is

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,680
more of the Fried Chicken of a career

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,020
advice it tastes great but it's probably

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,200
not good for you uh as with all advice

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,720
it's just as likely to be bad as good

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,360
also as with all advice don't blame me

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,180
if you follow my advice and fail

48
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,040
being too rigid and adhering to the

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,840
details that I present will either get

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,939
you fired or promoted these things are

51
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,220
the extremes of any career they are the

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,920
spinach and ice cream of career advice

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,899
a good ballot's usually lies somewhere

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,460
in the middle

55
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,860
where possible I avoid the use of Court

56
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,139
speak to convey the ideas that I think

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,239
are important things are rarely as

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,940
simple as magenta cyan and yellow you

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,040
kind of get used to it after a while

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
also those disclaimers are fun and you

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
know they make me happy but representing

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,420
a corporation or even

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,000
um having the corporation's logo on on

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,879
your presentation and an external uh

65
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,580
Symposium means that invariably somebody

66
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,680
asks you to include an actual disclaimer

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,660
that looks something like this

68
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,140
that's uh probably Fair uh to the

69
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,940
company the funny thing is that this

70
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,099
says almost exactly what my disclaimer

71
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,019
say I'm not giving you advice and even

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,519
if I were giving you advice you

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,019
shouldn't follow it without doing your

74
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,260
own homework what you get is quote as is

75
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,300
end quote

76
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,160
um and as the Bad actors and cute

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,900
hoodies like to say for entertainment

78
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,300
purposes only they tell me that this

79
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,700
disclaimer is probably important but I'm

80
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,980
not a lawyer so it may not be important

81
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,900
after all who knows

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,519
um onward

83
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,220
further before we begin I need to or at

84
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,319
least try to establish credibility so

85
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,840
I'll explain who I am where I am and how

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,780
I got where I am I'm jinxedo I run

87
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,760
Global Information Security Consolidated

88
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,159
lab for a major National Bank whose logo

89
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,739
may or may not appear on this slide this

90
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,599
is my Professional Profile it's

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,060
available on LinkedIn or other places

92
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,340
that my employer won't let me visit

93
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,440
while I'm at work or you know I can

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,959
email it to you I was born in the U.S

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,879
state of Louisiana if you think about

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
all the places that you know about in

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,840
Louisiana and subtract them what you get

98
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,879
is my hometown

99
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,920
if you've ever seen the U.S television

100
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,680
show Duck Dynasty it's a lot like that

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
except with all the civilization and

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
culture

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,560
and the Bland light of the dawn of time

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,379
like many folks from Louisiana I started

105
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,140
life and offshore oil drilling

106
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,640
um offshore work in the Gulf of Mexico

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
is two weeks on at all rigged two weeks

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,500
of free time and my two weeks all about

109
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,420
worked at a major national retailer

110
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,459
whose name does not appear on this slide

111
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,000
one day I found out that uh oil rigs

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,519
sometimes do this so I quit because

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,339
quite honestly that's kind of dumb also

114
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,440
working as a stalker in a retail Mega

115
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,600
chain isn't as fun as it sounds so I

116
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,040
quit that job too

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,440
while driving home with an extreme lack

118
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,540
of employment Lee Greenwood's God Bless

119
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,940
the USA came on the radio

120
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,340
show I pulled into a recruiting station

121
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,740
and joined the US Army this was the

122
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,540
early 90s so they probably felt pretty

123
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,620
good about

124
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,960
uh about it when they promised that you

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
know I would only have to do domestic

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,860
missions you know floods hurricanes

127
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,259
humanitarian work that sort of thing so

128
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,080
cool sounded fun

129
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,880
uh nine months later this picture was

130
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,280
taken I can't tell you where it was

131
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,020
taken but I can promise you that the

132
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,479
sand you see in this picture was not in

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,180
West Texas in the intervening nine

134
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,280
months the Army spent a lot of time and

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,139
a bucket load of money teaching me to

136
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,320
repair some fairly exotic electronics

137
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,000
and I served in the Gulf War during

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,100
operations Desert Shield and Desert

139
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,940
Storm

140
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,120
during the War I did war stuff after the

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,620
war ended I kind of worked through the

142
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,479
military but at the same time didn't

143
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,120
it's a thing the best way to explain it

144
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,259
is

145
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,479
um I spent time in a school learning

146
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,060
things and got a job working for the

147
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,220
people on stuff we can't talk about

148
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,320
actually it's probably okay to talk

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,940
about the stuff that I worked on because

150
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,620
those things still don't exist in the

151
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,520
world so that's not to

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,259
um after a while I quit working for the

153
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,300
people because of stuff and decided to

154
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,860
get a real education

155
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,900
so enrolled in Northwestern University

156
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,440
or more correctly Northwestern State

157
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,960
University of Louisiana which looks

158
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,900
exactly the same on a resume in cases

159
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,039
you didn't

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,380
you can't place where that is it's uh

161
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,900
here that's still the middle of nowhere

162
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,600
just nearer to the interstate

163
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,639
um around 1995 I read a book about

164
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,280
computers built the 386 and learned to

165
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,539
program it

166
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,680
um

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,100
and promptly dropped out got married to

168
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,340
my lovely wife Jody moved to Chicago and

169
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,800
got a job at UBS because you know like

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,620
good good life choices and things over

171
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,720
the next decade or so I worked my way up

172
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,639
to be director of engineering for the

173
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,880
Americas at UBS uh and my time there I

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
helped create a product called

175
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,840
interchange which was a Java based group

176
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,720
chat client based on the IRC protocols

177
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
that started as a way to prove the

178
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,979
Enterprise capabilities of java in the

179
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,100
early 90s or mid 90s

180
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,780
um

181
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,080
and morphed into a tool that was used by

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,319
nearly every employee globally that it

183
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,180
was eventually spun off into a startup

184
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,360
from the from UBS uh that was later sold

185
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,220
to Microsoft to become part of the

186
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,800
Microsoft teams product that product got

187
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,460
me my first listing as an inventor on a

188
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,580
padded uh patent So Good Times

189
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,880
however in 2007 it snowed a lot which

190
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,100
looked like this so I quit and moved to

191
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,440
Charlotte North Carolina where I spent a

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,419
lot of time fishing before landing a job

193
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,759
as a first line help desk support Tech

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,979
on the loan trading desk

195
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,340
at the largest consumer Bank in the

196
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,319
country I was answering three emails a

197
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,099
day and rebooting desktops but I was

198
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,840
making the same money as before because

199
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,639
that's how directors of engineering for

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,400
the Americas do uh in any case I've been

201
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,580
here for 15 years and worked for most of

202
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,800
our eight lines of business I currently

203
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
run GIS Consolidated lab on the GI the

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
global information security innovation

205
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,859
and strategy team

206
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,638
however uh

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
earlier

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
um I briefly introduced you to my wife

209
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,539
Jody we've never had children however a

210
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,000
long time ago she and I adopted this

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,919
person we are incredibly proud of them

212
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,860
uh they in turn introduced us to these

213
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,620
three beautiful people they are uh

214
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,479
amaryllis on the right and that could be

215
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,180
on the left and Camellia also we can't

216
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,180
forget the engine ingeniously named blue

217
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,879
puppy who is there Judy and I were the

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,620
first people to other than their parents

219
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,020
to hold every one of these after they

220
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,659
were born they called me Papa and I like

221
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,500
it you however should not call me pawpaw

222
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,299
I still enjoy mucking around with

223
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,279
electronics and making mundane things do

224
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,140
interesting things through judicious

225
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,180
application of the angry pixies that we

226
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,220
all keep in our wall sockets

227
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,620
uh shout out to anyone that recognizes

228
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,019
that poster in the in the slide there

229
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,519
it's a miterate tech Enterprise

230
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,000
framework version one uh which I have

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
since framed and I have it on on the

232
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
wall here

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,519
when I need to unplug for a while I do

234
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,320
hand tool woodworking in which I turn

235
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,660
organic carbon foam obtained from dead

236
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,760
tree carcasses into furniture without

237
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,500
the use of the previously mentioned

238
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,380
angry Pixies uh usually these things are

239
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,540
assembled with uh without the use of

240
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,640
metal as well just you know tight

241
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,800
joinery and glue

242
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,440
when I get bored with that uh I learn to

243
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,540
do hard things like sailboats or fly

244
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,540
airplanes because why wouldn't you

245
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,160
uh other than that I pretty much hang

246
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,720
out with friends in the community and

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,660
feed people because hey oh food uh

248
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,880
although not much in the last 24 months

249
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
because Kobe

250
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,560
uh so this shift focus into something

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,600
now into something that I'm very

252
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,480
passionate about Innovation but first no

253
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
presentation would be really useful

254
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,320
without a central philosophy and

255
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,260
a few years ago I adopted a philosophy

256
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,500
created by uh Dr Harold Edgerton of MIT

257
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,480
some of you may have heard it some of

258
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,040
you have probably seen his work and

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,260
didn't know that you were seeing it the

260
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,839
philosophy is this uh work hard because

261
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,540
work is an activity involving mental or

262
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,700
physical effort uh done in order to

263
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,040
achieve a purposeful result simply put

264
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
no work no purpose no result

265
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,200
tell everyone everything you know uh

266
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,820
we're sometimes called knowledge workers

267
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,519
for us knowledge is a commodity if you

268
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,260
share the knowledge that you have you

269
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,779
will gain from it a closer deal with a

270
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,279
handshake though this is from

271
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,320
pre-covered times that simply means be

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,360
trustworthy uh if you say you're going

273
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,640
to do something do it if you say you're

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
not going to do something don't do it uh

275
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,899
where I work this is called trust the

276
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,060
team it's one of the five core values

277
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,279
and finally have fun because if you're

278
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,680
not having fun at your job you are

279
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
literally wasting your time

280
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,300
um sure you might be making all the

281
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,540
dollars but without Joy it will be a sad

282
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,480
consolation prize have fun loosen up

283
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,420
work can be fun if you let it with that

284
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,100
out of the way let's talk about some

285
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,800
simple truth about innovating in any

286
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,540
Enterprise

287
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,459
take a screenshot of this page or

288
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,140
because of the cyber security conference

289
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,060
grab your phone and take a picture of

290
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,700
these names go find out one thing about

291
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,519
all of them take a deep dive on some of

292
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,620
them in my career I've met many of these

293
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,420
people personally uh within their

294
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,640
particular Fields they are legendary

295
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,980
some of them are quite literally Living

296
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,800
Legends and talking to them I found out

297
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,019
something interesting they don't act

298
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,360
like Legends they're just people they're

299
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,880
that are very passionate about doing one

300
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,839
thing well

301
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,300
so when Ken Thompson created the B

302
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,860
programming language and then helped

303
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,480
Dennis Ritchie expand it into the C

304
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,279
programming language they weren't trying

305
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,320
to change the world they were trying to

306
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,660
write applications for the then new Unix

307
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,700
operating system they ended up creating

308
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,980
a programming language that was the very

309
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,680
foundation for uh nearly everything we

310
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
do today because they were passionate

311
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,899
about doing the small things well they

312
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,640
did something foundational for the whole

313
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,519
industry which leads us to you know do

314
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,839
something big

315
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,820
the internet was envisioned by a single

316
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,700
person Leonard kleinrock in 1961 but it

317
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,380
wasn't developed

318
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,339
um until almost a decade later in 1969

319
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,079
the first network switch was installed

320
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,500
at UCLA uh email was developed in 1971

321
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,899
by Ray Tomlinson in order to communicate

322
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,600
with other researchers on the network

323
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,320
TCP was designed uh by Surf and Khan in

324
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,360
1973. Ethernet was also developed in

325
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,540
1973 by Bob Metcalf Dennis Hayes

326
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,220
released the first modem to allow people

327
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,300
to join the network remotely in 1977.

328
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,060
DNS was introduced in 1984 the first

329
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,519
commercial dial up was created in 1989

330
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,060
and finally in 1990 Tim berners-lee

331
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,940
invented HTML in the world wide web as a

332
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,680
way of graphically sharing mathematical

333
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,440
formula with others and then these

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,480
people created something magnificent

335
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,940
because they just did the work that they

336
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,800
enjoyed and shared it

337
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,540
they were all doing huge things but

338
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,120
here's the key they didn't actually

339
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,220
didn't necessarily know that they were

340
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,019
doing huge things they learned things

341
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,760
and worked hard to solve very specific

342
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,040
problems that they needed to solve they

343
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,480
shared the knowledge that they gained

344
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,220
with others openly and freely it's

345
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,139
something that we do very well in the

346
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,620
cyber security cyber security Community

347
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,300
the collaborative work from these people

348
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
have has literally changed everything

349
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,100
about the way that we work today but in

350
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,320
their minds they're not Legends they're

351
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,360
just people like you or me that had a

352
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,980
specific problem and shared the solution

353
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,560
with the world uh others picked up on

354
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,540
that work and did more things with it

355
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,540
and now we have Tick Tock so uh who

356
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,620
knows right

357
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,420
they each had managers they had project

358
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,279
plans and meetings and calendars to

359
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
manage they simply shared and learned

360
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,279
from one another

361
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,920
uh the the Global Information Security

362
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,320
Lab at Bank of America uh is an

363
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480
excellent example of the Innovation that

364
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,600
can happen in very large Enterprises uh

365
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,060
it's a Starship quality lab built with

366
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,639
the best technology available it runs as

367
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,220
a non-production environment that hosts

368
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,899
all of the things that can't be hosted

369
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,600
on the production network uh the actual

370
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,820
the architecture is on so that high risk

371
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,500
activities are segregated from the rest

372
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,660
of the lab and from the production

373
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,920
Network

374
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,380
uh two of my patents are around the ways

375
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,480
that we segregate workloads and manage

376
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,820
access to them the lab is used to test

377
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,800
vendor appliances

378
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,980
um and do malware investigations

379
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,260
complete forensic analysis on suspect

380
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,839
Hardware execute training and evaluate

381
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,940
software from vendors it's also used by

382
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,680
our Innovation and strategy teams to

383
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,320
build and Test new ideas and quick

384
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,760
iterations

385
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,399
we have a virtualization tools uh that

386
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,440
can spin up any OS and the company's

387
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
catalog in minutes and we're staffed by

388
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,980
seven full-time Engineers so yeah dream

389
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,800
job right this allows us to quickly

390
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,079
assist with incident response and

391
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,079
malware analysis efforts uh the gis Co

392
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
was designed from the ground up to be

393
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,040
the most secure environment in the

394
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,320
company and to allow us to be the most

395
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,600
agile environment available while

396
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,940
ensuring that we meet or exceed delivery

397
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,360
letter and spirit of every control uh

398
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,620
too many

399
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,380
too many uh cyber security teams have

400
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,300
exceptions to controls and governance

401
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,860
because of the nature of the work that

402
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,860
we do but within uh our environment

403
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,260
within the lab environment our ethos

404
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,120
requires that if we put controls on the

405
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
end users we have to meet or exceed that

406
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,279
control uh that can be pretty complex

407
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,060
but it's absolutely possible we have a

408
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,880
no exceptions policy in the lab that is

409
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,760
strictly maintained so you know yay for

410
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,079
governance meetings

411
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,820
uh the giscl is also used as a

412
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,339
a red team hide

413
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,500
um so that you know we can do

414
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,079
evaluations and other red team stuff

415
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,019
without uh being directly on the

416
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,940
production Network which helps them hide

417
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,160
from The Blue Team uh we also let the

418
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,440
blue team use parts of the lab to chase

419
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,600
down and squish red teamers because life

420
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,339
is no fun unless you're squishing your

421
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,260
co-workers

422
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,380
um

423
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,800
I skipped ahead there it's also home to

424
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,079
another project that I was responsible

425
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,240
for building at the bank it was called

426
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,579
the adversarial engagement environment

427
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,440
before the rest of the world caught on

428
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,660
and started calling it a cyber range a

429
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,880
few years ago we use that environment to

430
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,259
help vendors build cyber range

431
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,360
environment management software and meet

432
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
with many of them regularly regularly to

433
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,220
share experience and ideas that we

434
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,279
generate while the ranges are active our

435
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,519
experience experience and expertise with

436
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,320
cyber ranges continues to drive the

437
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,060
industry and allows us to do both

438
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,399
training and required evaluations for

439
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,500
the bank

440
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
of

441
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,180
not all Innovations have to be

442
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,640
multi-million dollar projects uh like

443
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,880
the lab was uh this one is this is one

444
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,859
that my friend Michael overins and I

445
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,640
wrote in about three hours in Java uh it

446
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,040
extended the work done by bitly and now

447
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,980
defunct Google URL shortener to provide

448
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,500
shortened URLs internally uh to the

449
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,359
company because it's hard to memorize

450
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,640
full URLs especially if your

451
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,980
organization uh uses things like

452
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,160
SharePoint or other CMS tools

453
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,220
um we link to a lot of data into URL

454
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,240
shorteners

455
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,900
um

456
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,340
so having one that is internal only uh

457
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,919
made us feel a lot better about having

458
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,500
that data floating around yeah interfere

459
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,440
the fun we registered top level

460
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,059
domain.gov

461
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,440
internally and made the machine host

462
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,380
name simply the letter U totally for the

463
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,039
purpose of creating a uh your the URL

464
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,360
https Cola slash slash you dot go girl

465
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,360
uh which redirects to a user to our uh

466
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,880
women in technology and Ops

467
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,860
um so we're having a lot of fun with it

468
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,380
uh wrote the code and

469
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,740
um released it into the company

470
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,380
um by the way Mike Logan is an author

471
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,419
and a prolific Bank of America innovator

472
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,940
who has appeared on television and in

473
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,220
other interesting places uh you should

474
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,440
you should spend a minute Googling uh

475
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,720
him as well we've worked together for

476
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,039
about a decade now uh He's listed as a

477
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,340
co-inventor on nearly 50 or age listed

478
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,160
as an inventor on 50 patents

479
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,280
um and uh from Bank of America and other

480
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,340
places uh you don't go started as a way

481
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,080
for us to share things among ourselves

482
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,299
without having to use external resources

483
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,460
and leaking intelligence to the cloud

484
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,679
like I said it works so well that we

485
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,960
shared the tool with a few others uh on

486
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,780
various teams and two years later we

487
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,160
took another look at it and there was

488
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,480
trafficking about three million

489
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,320
redirections a month and was used by

490
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,240
it was being used by our production

491
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,360
teams to support other applications uh

492
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,940
it was around then that we thought maybe

493
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,620
we should productionize this and not

494
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,179
have it running on a server under the

495
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,179
desk uh that those often the way that

496
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,799
Innovation Works in a major Enterprise

497
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,200
do the thing that makes your life easier

498
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,720
and share it when it gets too big to

499
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,100
manage threaten to turn it off until

500
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,720
somebody takes it away from you it's

501
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,419
probably not the best approach but it

502
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,980
certainly gets you passed at least a few

503
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,320
governance roadblocks

504
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,960
so like I said you know you could get

505
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,780
fired with this presentation uh but I'm

506
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,460
working I'm lucky to work in an

507
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,020
Enterprise that places emphasis on

508
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,240
Innovation so we lead the industry in

509
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,360
U.S patents with about 5 000 patents

510
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,660
granted or applied for and almost 6 000

511
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,360
employee inventors uh listed globally

512
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,059
and Innovation is at the heart of what

513
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,880
we do uh so we innovate to provide

514
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,740
industry-leading capabilities that

515
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,260
improve our clients Financial lives and

516
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,480
to help create the the best place for

517
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,940
our teammates to work foreign

518
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,160
our focus on Innovation ensures that we

519
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,679
remain at the Forefront of as a

520
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,020
financial institution as we continue to

521
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,059
deliver responsible growth to our

522
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,940
clients shareholders and teammates I may

523
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,299
or may not have written that slide uh

524
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,120
we enable everyone to be an innovator at

525
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,700
Bank of America Innovation is not uh

526
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,240
siled to one organization or location

527
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,400
even if teams like mine exist to lead

528
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,960
the way

529
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,820
um

530
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,160
we believe that executing and building

531
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,620
Upon Our core strategies gives rise and

532
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,380
focus Focus to Innovation that's why we

533
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,240
we have thousands of inventors and

534
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,179
record patents across our Enterprise but

535
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,640
as an individual how do I take advantage

536
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,980
of that it's actually pretty easy at the

537
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,840
bank

538
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,220
Innovation security or I'm sorry

539
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,740
information security at Bank of America

540
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,179
just crossed uh we just got our 1000th

541
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,660
patent uh just within uh the information

542
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,240
security team at Bank of America you

543
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,299
probably Google that and find uh lots of

544
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,400
stuff

545
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,240
um

546
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,100
so how do you innovate in the Enterprise

547
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,260
there are several traits that highly

548
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,600
Innovative people have uh first be

549
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,700
curious try to understand how things

550
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,440
work take them apart put them back

551
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,320
together tweak them uh to make them do

552
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,419
different things I always have a browser

553
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,400
open to Bing or Google and I'm always

554
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,740
searching for knowledge on conference

555
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,900
calls if someone says something that I

556
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,240
don't understand I search for answers if

557
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,980
they say something interesting I try to

558
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,440
find out more about it

559
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
um there are people where I work known

560
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
as smes or subject matter experts they

561
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,460
tend to be legendary within our own

562
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,799
circles

563
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,200
some of them are speaking at this

564
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,419
conference uh and I think I have a list

565
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,580
of them later but if not you can

566
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,299
probably find them

567
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,220
whatever your area of expertise is learn

568
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,200
everything that you can about it and

569
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,720
when people uh ask share what you know

570
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,020
there's only uh so much that you can

571
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,820
learn from books most of learning is

572
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,440
seeing how other people have solved

573
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,020
similar problems for programmers a good

574
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,940
measure is that you should probably read

575
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,340
50 lines of code for every line that you

576
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,400
write in my career I've written hundreds

577
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,740
of thousands of lines of code which

578
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,500
means I've probably read Millions not

579
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,780
every line of code is groundbreaking and

580
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,880
unique but occasionally you see

581
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,280
something done in an interesting way and

582
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,159
adapted into your message

583
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,799
the same applies in in cyber security

584
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,020
right if you're if you're breaking

585
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,299
things or making things

586
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,280
um a lot of what you do is just looking

587
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,380
at what other people have done and then

588
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,600
expanding on that and changing it I

589
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,940
learned uh much the same thing when I

590
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,620
was helping my grandfather build houses

591
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,380
as a teenager right it works in every

592
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,299
discipline and it's incredibly important

593
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,280
to be in an Innovative learn from others

594
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,840
merge Knowledge from different places

595
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,659
and create new ways of doing things then

596
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,120
share those things with others now let's

597
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,780
explore uh some other trees

598
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,640
we all know how frustrating it is when

599
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,380
your help desk ticket gets closed with

600
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,559
sorry wrong cue try again uh don't be

601
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,840
that person uh anytime somebody asks me

602
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,640
a question I try to find the answer for

603
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,100
them or find the people that can answer

604
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,860
the question be that person never leave

605
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,080
somebody hanging I often get notes from

606
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
people that say Hey you help me figure

607
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,380
this out a few years ago and I was able

608
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,940
to share it with my team today thanks

609
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,980
for that uh make a difference in

610
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,780
somebody's life it may be something that

611
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,520
takes you a few extra minutes to share

612
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,799
and they'd probably figure it out in a

613
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,380
few hours or days but your few minutes

614
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,240
will save them that time and make it a

615
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,980
better place to work for literally

616
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,679
everybody you gain a reputation you gain

617
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,520
friends uh in the process

618
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,980
don't be a glory Hound but on your own

619
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,179
work

620
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,980
um that basically means present your

621
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,960
work to others when required or asked

622
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,539
but don't be the person that only talks

623
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,640
about their own work put your name on

624
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,260
your work can then highlight the work of

625
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,380
your peers or those that contributed

626
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,799
everybody knows who created something in

627
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,780
most places sharing the spotlight with

628
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,640
your peers is recognized and rewarded

629
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,200
don't worry about getting uh promoted

630
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,419
worry about doing the best job you can

631
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,460
stay where you are and learn everything

632
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,679
that you possibly can about the work

633
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,419
that you're doing

634
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,700
once you've uh learned everything you

635
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,220
can about an area move on to something

636
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,900
else career Mobility

637
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm sorry uh career Mobility is really

638
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,240
easy where I work talk to people about

639
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,280
the things that you want to learn let

640
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
them know that you're looking to expand

641
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,360
into something else uh and if you become

642
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
stagnant in a rope or you're not getting

643
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,860
promoted Leave It Go learn something

644
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,799
else you don't have to leave uh your

645
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,200
company to just find a new role and move

646
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,440
on also while you're at it take your

647
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,140
time I mentioned earlier I've worked for

648
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,500
all eight lines of business in 15 years

649
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,120
so you're just slowly moving around the

650
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
company learning things and

651
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,419
um

652
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,200
using that knowledge to sort of expand

653
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,679
my my uh expertise into more of a

654
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,100
generalist uh field uh which is serving

655
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,980
me really well and and working in the

656
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,520
the gis Lab at Bank of America

657
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,260
also you know while you're at it take

658
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,900
your time uh the difference between an

659
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,840
entry-level role and ciso is the

660
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,000
difference of a career not a few years

661
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,779
so uh have a career plan work hard but

662
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:03,179
don't expect the BC so overnight learn

663
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,679
the things you need to know to be the

664
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,940
best CSO you can be before you get there

665
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,919
oh this is the fun one

666
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,480
um when I joined a call and somebody

667
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,400
asked me how I'm doing I always respond

668
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,340
with hey I'm just Zippy or I'm doing

669
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,500
amazing today I hope you are

670
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,480
um we all know that person that could be

671
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,360
standing for uh Eeyore uh the person

672
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,279
that's always tired or sad or frustrated

673
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,679
and Hey look it's cyber security so

674
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,740
sometimes we are tired and sad and

675
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,360
frustrated

676
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,080
um

677
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,659
but that really brings the the tone of

678
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,539
the entire day down for uh for everybody

679
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,400
and it just makes things boring and hard

680
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,100
I try not to be that person uh try to be

681
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,380
engaged be happy you have work to do

682
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,000
that's interesting or do something that

683
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,520
makes it more interesting uh besided

684
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,740
about excited about coming to to work

685
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,240
every day even if you have to drink

686
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,580
extra coffee uh there's Starbucks on

687
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,980
every corner uh make it happen be

688
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,860
engaging in fun being engaging in fun

689
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,720
makes other people want to help you uh

690
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,820
up and it helps them feel good about

691
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,159
asking you for help which is something

692
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,320
that that you really want to do

693
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,320
another diversity uh diversity where I

694
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,900
work has always been a key area of focus

695
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,360
uh I volunteer in a lot of places that

696
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,400
help women succeed because they're

697
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,260
incredibly important to us as a Tech

698
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,900
Community my own involvement in those

699
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,059
efforts has kind of evolved over time as

700
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,179
I've become more well more aware of the

701
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,419
challenges those that they face those

702
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,580
challenges are not challenges that I

703
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,559
want this woman to face when she works

704
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,900
with me in a couple of decades

705
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,659
uh my company just strives to support

706
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,700
many versions of diversity and I support

707
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,380
many of them through participation in

708
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,940
various committees and working groups

709
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,360
some of them are more special to me than

710
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
others however

711
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
uh remember this person from earlier

712
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,240
they have things about them that make

713
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,640
them incredibly special they don't work

714
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,860
where I do they're putting themselves

715
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,539
through college to be an accountant

716
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,720
currently yay Niners uh and raising

717
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,179
three incredible children alone but one

718
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,480
day I hope they will work with me and

719
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,059
when they do I intend to make sure that

720
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,520
they are welcome respected and loved

721
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,720
from day Zero don't check that box

722
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,600
diversity though isn't just about race

723
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,960
or gender or preference uh seek out

724
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,700
people that have different backgrounds

725
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,400
and experiences I'm a drop out from the

726
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,380
backwoods of Central Louisiana some of

727
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,179
my coolest Works have been created in

728
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:37,980
partnership with people from all

729
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,600
different backgrounds and from all

730
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,799
around the world

731
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,260
I wouldn't be listed as an inventor

732
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,659
without them the co-inventor on several

733
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,820
of my patents is from the Northeast he

734
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,279
grew up in New Jersey his life was

735
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,679
completely different from mine so our

736
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,500
ideas don't always align but we always

737
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,419
use our different viewpoints to generate

738
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,880
a better idea than either either of us

739
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,940
could have achieved a loan all right now

740
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,600
some some final thoughts here

741
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,580
some some of the things that I learned

742
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,380
on the first day in a corporate

743
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,299
environment are things that I still use

744
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,400
every day understanding the basics of

745
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,179
tcpip created in the 80s is useful in my

746
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,039
everyday troubleshooting of challenges

747
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:23,520
and the gis Consolidated lab uh most of

748
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,140
the things that we know today have

749
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,720
evolved from things that came from uh

750
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,179
before them so you know learn those

751
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,140
things and then expand on them

752
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,760
uh no one of us can run an Enterprise

753
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,340
without the help of the rest of us so

754
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,279
important literally everyone is just

755
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,380
trying to to get through the day with

756
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,960
enough emotional intelligence to uh

757
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,419
remaining to love somebody at home just

758
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,480
like you just like me uh sure sometimes

759
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,520
people are jerks but you can turn that

760
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,440
around by treating them with compassion

761
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,559
and empathy almost always uh if you

762
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,799
can't you can be comforted uh that those

763
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,299
people won't last long in most

764
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,120
Enterprises and certainly uh not in

765
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,520
cyber security

766
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,520
uh look I've talked more about sharing

767
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,200
knowledge with others and helping others

768
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
than I have about focusing on your own

769
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,840
role do that too focus on your role but

770
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,059
always take care of those around you uh

771
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,980
again none of us can do this alone I

772
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,020
have several friends that I chat with

773
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,820
throughout the day about interesting

774
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,460
ideas or thoughts uh we're not currently

775
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,500
working on any projects together but we

776
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,120
spend a lot of time just helping one

777
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,279
another get through the day some of them

778
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,100
I have known for literally decades and

779
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,779
those friendships have carried across

780
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,140
multiple employers after getting my

781
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,720
first job I've never been hired into a

782
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,059
role that didn't come from a contact uh

783
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,240
in my network and I've been incredibly

784
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,419
mobile over the course of my career

785
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,640
so one last thing

786
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,299
um

787
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,240
why is it 41 and a half slides well

788
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,059
because it's almost the ultimate answer

789
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,159
to life the universe and everything but

790
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,840
it's not quite

791
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,299
um so congratulations to those of you

792
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,940
that got this joke uh don't forget your

793
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,559
towel

794
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,360
um

795
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,659
look obviously this wasn't your normal

796
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,539
leadership or innovation or cyber

797
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,840
security presentation and honestly my

798
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,059
personal profile went on for way too

799
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,159
long however I thought it was important

800
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,960
it was everything that's going on in the

801
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
world I need to take a moment to remind

802
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,980
you of two things right

803
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,899
We're All in This Soup Sandwich together

804
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,120
uh none of us can do it alone even

805
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,000
people like me who buy most accounts but

806
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,880
not all I have a very successful career

807
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,279
and a really happy life we still need

808
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,559
people that we can paint on any given

809
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,299
Wednesday and just say hey I'm glad

810
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,240
you're my friend or I love you

811
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,039
I love you

812
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,200
um I love every one of you

813
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,020
um so I don't really care what your race

814
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,659
is or your gender is or even if you

815
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,020
prefer emacs over by

816
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,840
or saying crazy things like Jif instead

817
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,080
of gifts that's actually probably not

818
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,380
true I do care what your race is

819
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,440
um

820
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,299
and what your preferences are and what

821
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,940
your challenges are whether you're

822
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,159
Autistic or dyslexic or any of the other

823
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,559
things that are part of who you are as

824
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,200
part of you and you are important you

825
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,820
make a difference you matter

826
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,179
I'm glad that you're my friends now uh

827
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,120
here's your participation trophy go do

828
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,159
something useful with it I'll be hanging

829
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,140
out on Discord for a bit uh so if you

830
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,480
want to chat uh please feel free I

831
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,220
