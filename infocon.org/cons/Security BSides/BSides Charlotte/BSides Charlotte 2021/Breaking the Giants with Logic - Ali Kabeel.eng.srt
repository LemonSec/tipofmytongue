1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,560
okay so hello everybody and welcome to

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,899
uh this year in beside Charlotte I'm Ali

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,120
khabil and today we will be presenting

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
the presentation title breaking the

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,080
giant switch logic this is actually the

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,940
second one in the series so we have the

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,740
first part last year and we are having

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,140
the second part right here today

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,500
so let's kick off with some who am I

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,300
um so I'm a security engineer at bending

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,100
spoons but just a disclaimer this talk

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,140
is not sponsored by my employer in any

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,599
way it's just me uh I have been a Bug

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,460
Hunter and a security researcher since

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,320
2014 and we will know what's really

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,059
about countries in case you are curious

17
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,500
about it

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,300
um I my research interest basically

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,040
evolve around privacy web application

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,739
security as well as network security and

21
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm particularly passionate about

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,100
exploiting vulnerabilities bare-handed

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,020
and we will know exactly today what

24
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,140
bare-handed exploitation mean

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,879
um as a hobby I like giving talks in

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,100
several besides presentation uh besides

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,899
security conferences

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,579
um and this is my last year here luckily

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,039
so I'm really glad to use you all uh in

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,420
case you want to find me on social media

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,700
so feel free to reach out uh logic

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,820
breaker on Twitter and um so enough with

33
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,280
who am I and let's kick into uh some

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,619
motivation of today's topic

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,080
so before we start we you might have

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,700
noticed that we talk about breaking the

37
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,560
joints with logic so let's break down

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,840
the title into two pieces so the first

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,759
piece which is breaking the joints and

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,740
by the joints we mean gigantic companies

41
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,439
basically the big player the one that

42
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,659
have massive amount of

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,180
data centers and data stored examples

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,400
are Facebook Instagram Google Snapchat

45
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,040
and so on uh so we want to break those

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,420
we want to break something as big as

47
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,360
that using logic and now let's talk a

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,759
bit about what logic is and I must

49
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,560
apologize to anybody who have ever been

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,799
into a formal logic class this is not

51
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,299
what you are expecting we are talking

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,100
about informal logic something that's

53
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,979
really simple so informally logic is

54
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,540
what people think is right what people

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,840
think makes sense so if I told you that

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
um in the middle of the summer uh it's

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
gonna be freezing and it's currently

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,960
snowing for example you are telling me

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,940
this is nonsense it's not logical why

60
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,440
because it is not what we know it's not

61
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,459
what

62
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,500
um The Common Sense agrees on

63
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,599
so logic had been there for years and

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
it's actually since eternity that it's

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
the core of mathematics physics and

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,239
computer science people reading about

67
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,340
things this is what logic basically is

68
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,040
and let's just take a look away from

69
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,560
security at a very simple logical bug so

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
let's see this function defined in

71
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,280
Python it's obviously an addition

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,260
function so you just take two arguments

73
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,480
X and Y and it should return their

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,040
multiplication sorry their addition

75
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,239
um and as you can see here uh what's

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,379
basically returning in their

77
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,780
multiplication so if I printed add one

78
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,239
two uh basically I'm expecting three but

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,040
this is not what's happening so when the

80
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
code run the code will definitely run

81
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,000
does it have any syntactical error that

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
would be code during compound during uh

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,860
interpretation time nothing at all the

84
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,480
code will run perfectly but it's not the

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,099
result that you are expecting it's not a

86
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,720
logical result the addition of one and

87
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,580
two is three and not two so this is

88
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,099
basically a very simple logical bug the

89
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,599
program runs but it's not doing what's

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
expected to do of course this is very

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
simple

92
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,019
it has almost no security impact but it

93
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,459
is just to demonstrate the idea of

94
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,159
pathological bug can be so

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,540
um let's take

96
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,519
a sideway a little bit and talk about

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
the life of a bug Hunter so for those of

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,780
you who don't know bug hunting is

99
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,340
basically finding

100
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,319
um security vulnerabilities in companies

101
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,300
and Reporting it to them under what we

102
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,540
call responsible disclosure policy

103
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,620
um you basically find the

104
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,819
vulnerabilities and if the company

105
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,739
accepts you to report those you just go

106
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,720
and report them if the company does not

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,340
have this policy you are not authorized

108
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,940
to do so so don't go along just

109
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,040
attacking people this doesn't work that

110
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,080
way it just be under a policy in that

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,440
case so there is really a bad struggle

112
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,599
in bug hunting that you may find a

113
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,280
security vulnerability in one website

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,799
and then go and think that this is a

115
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,480
really good vulnerability and in fact it

116
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,340
is but when you go to them and they told

117
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,080
you okay this is a duplicate and by

118
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,659
duplicate we simply mean this bug has

119
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,519
been reported before we are sorry we're

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,500
not paying you anything and now all the

121
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,659
work that you have done uh is done for

122
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,978
nothing basically

123
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,478
so

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,418
now as you can see this mean duplicates

125
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,400
are really bad you find really something

126
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,520
uh very effective but instead of it

127
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,040
paying off you just end up in pain in

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,740
that case so a good question that I

129
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,120
asked myself because I've been at my

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,100
counter for many years like why do

131
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,780
duplicates happen so basically

132
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,940
duplicates happen because people overly

133
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,160
rely on code vulnerabilities they always

134
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,080
rely on things related to remote code

135
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,639
execution related to cross-site

136
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
scripting vulnerabilities in the code

137
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,320
itself they don't really go into the

138
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,060
application logic we don't understand

139
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,040
the business model of the website

140
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,900
usually because this takes a lot of time

141
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,000
and people just want like what we call

142
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,259
Hot cache so they just report

143
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,940
vulnerabilities right away

144
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,400
without trying to understand the

145
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,100
business model or the goal of the

146
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,440
business in that case or the website uh

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
as we are talking about so

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,100
um I thought about how to get out of

149
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,660
this duplicate Zone and I found actually

150
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,940
two interesting answers the first one is

151
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,860
that you should be like extremely

152
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,199
experienced in coding and you can find

153
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,000
things that are what we call D-Day

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,979
vulnerabilities they are really very

155
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,600
hard to do and

156
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,580
you actually need more years of

157
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,560
experience just to build this amount of

158
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,660
technical knowledge that enable you to

159
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,639
report those kind of vulnerabilities but

160
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,860
there is a much easier way which is just

161
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,960
where your thinking hat think about the

162
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,340
business model think about what's

163
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
logical and what's not logical

164
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,600
so let me give you an example of

165
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,639
something that is a logical

166
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
vulnerability just for you to understand

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
how this can slip so imagine that you

168
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,360
are on an e-commerce website something

169
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,220
like Amazon for example and then you are

170
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,080
buying your goods and all of a sudden

171
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,900
you are buying something for 100 for

172
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,060
example and then while checking out you

173
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,860
find out that you can manipulate the

174
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,440
price to like one dollar and all of a

175
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,600
sudden you got your items instead of one

176
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
hundred dollars with one dollar this

177
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
happened because basically there is no

178
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,820
check on that so of course this won't

179
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,440
happen in Amazon but it may happen in

180
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,180
other side that they don't check if you

181
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,740
manipulated the price so you can get

182
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,120
your thing at a very discounted price

183
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,919
because this kind of check is not

184
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,060
working

185
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,380
um think about providing a negative

186
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,060
number for example so you just

187
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,560
manipulating the request going to the

188
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,240
server edit a negative number and now

189
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,620
instead of just

190
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,440
getting the goods uh for its real price

191
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,780
the negative price may be for example

192
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,720
map to zero or to any other unknown or

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,639
uncatched behavior and you end up

194
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,680
getting those items for free so this is

195
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,300
an example for logical vulnerability and

196
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,860
as you can see you just need to think

197
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,020
like a bad guy to do it it doesn't need

198
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,660
deep knowledge of coding it doesn't need

199
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,060
deep knowledge of security just think

200
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,039
like a bad guy understand the business

201
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,680
model and attack it it's hard for an

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,419
e-commerce website the worst nightmare

203
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,039
that they can have is people buying

204
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,539
goods for free if you do that the

205
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,100
business model will collapse and

206
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,319
eventually you will win

207
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,819
so

208
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,120
um let's go along and just dive into a

209
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,740
very short theoretical introduction to

210
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,500
business logic so we will borrow some

211
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
definitions from our friend that OAS and

212
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,160
Port zweger

213
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,780
um in case if you don't know them I

214
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,940
would greatly encourage you to go and

215
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,680
reach out to them because they are like

216
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,840
the core Foundation security especially

217
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,880
in web Security in that case so they

218
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
Define logic and vulnerabilities or what

219
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,780
we call business logic vulnerabilities

220
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,819
as those vulnerabilities affecting the

221
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,380
business model and the unique thing

222
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,360
about business logic vulnerability is

223
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,160
that they exist in the business model

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
itself in the process it's not about the

225
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,319
code it's not about finding

226
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,180
vulnerability that will make the code go

227
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,060
crazy it's about finding this unhandled

228
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,580
apks think that the developer might have

229
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,319
overlooked for example providing a

230
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,419
negative amount of money

231
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,039
um that would simply allow you to buy

232
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,660
things for free

233
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,759
um or for example finding a way to

234
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,620
double your

235
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,419
points whenever you are buying from

236
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,800
something so let me give you an example

237
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,580
uh loyalty programs exist and they are

238
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,280
very abundant and now

239
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,620
think about going to a shop and then

240
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,380
buying things for 100 so you'll get 100

241
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,259
points so if you can find a way to turn

242
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,139
those 100 points to like 1000 points and

243
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,879
then use those 1000 points to pay other

244
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,039
Goods since you are a very loyal

245
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,840
customer in that case this is a logical

246
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,879
vulnerability because for example the

247
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,860
shop would say for every 100 we are

248
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,659
giving you back five dollars as points

249
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,240
but if you can get 50 or 500 this means

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,099
that you might be taking Goods at a very

251
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,979
used price or even coding the shop to

252
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,020
give you money back by having more

253
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,180
points than what you have actually paid

254
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,020
for

255
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,820
so this is one example of business

256
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,860
logical vulnerabilities it again it

257
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,779
attacks the core of the business in that

258
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,820
case

259
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,040
so let's go away from Theory and let's

260
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,160
take a very simple case study uh

261
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,260
regarding one of the things that have

262
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,300
really a lot of logical vulnerability in

263
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,779
it so invitation systems and basically

264
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,060
um I usually refer to email based

265
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,160
invitation systems so email-based

266
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,600
invitation systems are extremely simple

267
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
uh let's take the case of for example

268
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,860
having Facebook groups

269
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,080
and in Facebook groups

270
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
um you just have this kind of nice

271
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
invitation somebody's inviting you to

272
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
join their group and this invitation

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,800
link

274
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,899
is present on

275
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,480
um it's sent to you on your email uh by

276
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,519
a group member or a group admin

277
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,500
and we want to think together what can

278
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,959
go wrong what exactly can go wrong with

279
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,760
this invitation so you see this kind of

280
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,180
invitation it's https so I know somebody

281
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,339
would say maybe it's unencrypted no it's

282
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,260
really well encrypted and they have

283
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,300
taken this kind of precautionary thing

284
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,339
to make sure that the connection is very

285
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,279
well protected but like really a lot of

286
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,800
things can go wrong Beyond this point

287
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
so let's have a look for example you can

288
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,480
find here a parameter called group ID in

289
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,820
that case this group ID seems pretty

290
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,220
interesting to me you have group ID one

291
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,660
two three what if you change it to one

292
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,279
to four maybe you are able to join

293
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,560
groups that you were never invited for

294
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,779
this is one interesting thing

295
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,420
so if there is no check on the group ID

296
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,399
and the request just go through you

297
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,019
might be able to Simply join another

298
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,420
group without being invited to it and

299
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,279
then the read the sender ID imagine that

300
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,980
groups would display who actually

301
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,640
um

302
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,279
invited you to this group similar to

303
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,860
some application which displays this

304
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,680
Clubhouse used to do that for example so

305
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,980
imagine that I I can simply make

306
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,360
somebody so famous like Marcus

307
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
Zuckerberg for example invite me to a

308
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,260
group and then everybody will see that

309
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,740
this guy invited me to this to this

310
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,899
group so I would take a lot of

311
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,339
credibility because I know Mark

312
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,959
Zuckerberg and it's actually Facebook

313
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,060
saying that I know that guy because they

314
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,459
say he invited me to this group so if

315
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,440
simply I changed the sender ID and it

316
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,399
works

317
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,019
congratulations now I got a lot of

318
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,480
credibility that I don't really deserve

319
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,640
or it's what's really true in that case

320
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,680
another thing in the member type so and

321
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,019
you see member type one as computer

322
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,880
scientists we know things usually start

323
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,680
from there so the first thing I would

324
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,079
think of maybe number type one is a

325
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,839
Norman member and zero is maybe an admin

326
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,760
for example so I would try to manipulate

327
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,440
this one and instead of joining the

328
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,459
group

329
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,820
um at the mere remember why not join as

330
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,440
an admin in that case so I will change

331
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
the one to zero and then see maybe

332
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
um it will just cause me to join an

333
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,459
admin in that case

334
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,380
um other things might be this kind of

335
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,899
token so this token for example maybe

336
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,940
this token is there to check that the

337
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,680
invitation is valid but what if I remove

338
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,540
the token altogether what will happen

339
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,399
when the invitation still work

340
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,920
in this token really uh poorly

341
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,200
formulated so it is just for example my

342
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,360
email so I can just change this email

343
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,279
and everything will work so this is

344
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,320
another point so

345
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,300
this token is pretty important for

346
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,399
example uh if it's really short can I

347
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,459
boot force it all of this just exists in

348
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,720
a single innocently looking uh URL but

349
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,880
all of these are visible and now let's

350
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,399
put our thinking hat on and think beyond

351
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,459
what we see so let me think about that

352
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,860
this invitation is intended to a single

353
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,959
person so a single person should be able

354
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,880
to use this invitation to join a group

355
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,680
but what if you can share it with your

356
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,860
friends so let's assume that this group

357
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,600
only admins are allowed to send

358
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,339
invitations so

359
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,959
whenever you want to join the group an

360
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,459
admin should invite you to this group

361
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,100
but now you have known that this link

362
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,779
can allow you to

363
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,540
let your friends join the group so our

364
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,339
now you are escalating your privileges

365
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,220
to more or less an admin privilege by

366
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,019
sharing this link with your friends they

367
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,519
are all in the group and instead of just

368
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,040
having this single person you are

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
inviting Your Role friends and family to

370
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,540
join this group this is a logical thing

371
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,579
why because the developer just didn't

372
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,200
check that whenever the link is used

373
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,540
just go expired

374
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,880
so this is one example of things beyond

375
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,060
what we see another thing is what will

376
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,320
happen if you were removed from your

377
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,360
group so imagine that you're a

378
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
troublemaker you join using this

379
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,779
invitation link the admin know that you

380
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:16,920
are going

381
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,019
doing bad stuff and just remove you from

382
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,660
your group and then all of a sudden you

383
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,600
just click the link and hooray you just

384
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,579
join back the group that you just left

385
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,160
because the link never expire this means

386
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,839
that the admin can never remove you from

387
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,160
the group and you are maintaining

388
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
persistent access maybe to a work group

389
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
for example so you are accessing

390
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,760
confidential information maybe

391
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,800
is a problem and this is again something

392
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,019
beyond what we see just put your

393
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,820
thinking hat on and the possibilities

394
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,459
are Limitless

395
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,500
um so enough with this example because

396
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,060
you might think that it's a theoretical

397
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,480
one but let's see something practical in

398
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,720
a really known uh application so today

399
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,399
we'll be having two very interesting

400
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,980
case studies the first one

401
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,660
um I called how to create friendships

402
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,000
that left Forever on Facebook and the

403
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,740
other one is how to become an invisible

404
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,120
stalker on Instagram and they would

405
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,680
assure you that they are pretty

406
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,320
interesting and can be exploited by

407
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
really somebody with no technical

408
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,920
knowledge at all which is pretty

409
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,300
interesting to me

410
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,660
so let's go to the Facebook case so back

411
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,820
in the days when Facebook was really

412
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,740
um less famous than now Facebook would

413
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,360
tell you okay you are on Facebook why

414
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,820
don't you just invite your friends so

415
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,680
just enter their email address and we

416
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,899
will tell them okay Ali wants to invite

417
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,360
you to join his Facebook account please

418
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,339
go and join his Facebook account and so

419
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,060
on

420
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,380
of course this feature is no longer

421
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,560
available because Facebook now is like

422
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,500
a billion user company so they don't do

423
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,060
that anymore but back in the days this

424
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,820
happened and the flow was exposed you

425
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,459
just send your friend an email and when

426
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,360
they joined Facebook Facebook

427
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,220
automatically adds you as their friend

428
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,660
because they assume that you are

429
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,459
inviting your friends so instead of

430
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,019
having the hassle of inviting somebody

431
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,699
and then sending their friend request

432
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,040
Facebook said okay let's combine those

433
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,540
together you invite somebody to Facebook

434
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,920
and they automatically become your

435
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,959
friend up till now there is nothing that

436
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,220
with that

437
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
so what happened that you invite

438
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,120
somebody to Facebook they join and they

439
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
are added as your friend now what

440
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
now simply you had a fight with them you

441
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,839
are no longer friends

442
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,519
um and you decided to remove them from

443
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,959
your Facebook so you just go along and

444
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
remove the person from your Facebook and

445
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,699
this should be it but this friend is a

446
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,860
bit smart and he thought okay when I

447
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,480
joined Facebook the first time

448
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,060
Ali was as my friend now I want to force

449
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,260
Ali back

450
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,540
to be my friend for whichever reason one

451
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,459
very interesting reason is that I want

452
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,699
to see his friends only post for example

453
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,199
so what can I do

454
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,480
it's pretty simple just go back to this

455
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,040
link invite that was sent to your email

456
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
re-click it again and you are just

457
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,540
re-accepting it and this really happened

458
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,279
so this is not a hypothetical scenario

459
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,800
this vulnerability existed in Facebook

460
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,920
in real so you just go

461
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,380
accept the invite again and that will be

462
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,779
added to your account and I can do

463
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,279
nothing about it and you can do that

464
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,339
presumably any number of times

465
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,560
like even if I block you you can still

466
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,480
return me as friend which is super weird

467
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,540
yeah this was what really happened so

468
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,399
what why did this happen in the first

469
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,139
place because the invitation that

470
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,720
Facebook sent has no expiry date it has

471
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,940
no expiry limit so it can be used once

472
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,800
twice and Thrice I'll tell you something

473
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,380
even more interesting you can use the

474
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,019
same invite for multiple people so it's

475
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,899
not just that I will re-add this person

476
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,639
will invite me once again I can just

477
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,680
distribute the invite and whoever gets

478
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,620
the link is Alice Friend by force Ali

479
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,060
can do nothing about it they can just

480
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,040
remove them and what happened is I will

481
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,560
just click the link again so it's like a

482
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,000
permanent friendship that will live

483
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,839
forever in that case

484
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,779
um so that's it about Facebook uh

485
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,519
invitations and now we'll be moving into

486
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,220
another interesting case study uh by

487
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,779
Instagram

488
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,020
so let's think before digging into the

489
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,299
details of Instagram and think about

490
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,819
the dream of a stalker like of course

491
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,319
I'm not encouraging you to be a stalker

492
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,480
this is not really nice but let's think

493
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,819
hypothetically about what a stalker

494
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,280
would like to have they would like to

495
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,380
have a permanent access to the person

496
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,959
they are stalking basically so they they

497
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,280
want to be

498
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,919
having some kind of permanent access to

499
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,540
the account

500
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,679
um the

501
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,600
all the posts they have access to there

502
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,280
is no friends only posts that are hidden

503
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,780
they have like full access to everything

504
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,940
uh the other thing that would like to be

505
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,919
is not being detected this is like the

506
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,419
nightmare of every stalker if you are

507
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,120
detected you are dead so

508
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
everybody would like to remain hidden

509
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,559
and silent and that's what stock really

510
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,380
wants and then Happy stopping if you

511
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,179
have those two conditions you are

512
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,919
actually in like

513
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,440
the paradise of stalking in that case so

514
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,640
let's

515
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,780
um let me tell you how this happened

516
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,460
back in the days on Instagram so

517
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,780
Facebook has just acquired Instagram

518
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,100
this was in 2015. and then Instagram had

519
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,140
um and still have actually those

520
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,940
features of blocking and following

521
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,160
people so whenever you want to be

522
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,660
friends with people you just follow them

523
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,760
whenever you want to actually say I

524
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
don't want to see you again in my life

525
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,360
you just block people but those things

526
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
were not freely connected in a logical

527
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,120
way

528
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,539
how is that so

529
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,919
if we think in a logical manner it

530
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,179
shouldn't be the case that you are able

531
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,799
to follow somebody and block them

532
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,720
simultaneously you either want to be

533
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,340
their friends or don't want to see them

534
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,620
again in your life doing both is really

535
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,020
not hard but Instagram all the

536
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,940
developers didn't really catch this case

537
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,980
so what you could do basically is block

538
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,140
somebody and then simultaneously follow

539
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,600
them so here is what happened

540
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,120
will you block somebody Instagram would

541
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,100
prevent them from seeing you from seeing

542
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,419
your profile from seeing anything

543
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,799
related to you

544
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,320
we can't see your post they can search

545
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,179
you nothing at all which is the perfect

546
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,160
blocking mechanism I don't want somebody

547
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,200
that I locked reach out to me in anyway

548
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,299
perfect and then what happens when you

549
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,620
follow somebody when you follow somebody

550
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,039
basically you can see their posts

551
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
um you can like verbose you can comment

552
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,780
on their posts and what happened in the

553
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,240
vector pose so you block somebody they

554
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
can't see you they can't know that you

555
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,960
are in their follow list because you

556
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,700
follow them after blocking them so

557
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,960
you're in the follow list but you are

558
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,059
not seen they can see your comments or

559
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,620
likes so you can comment to their images

560
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,660
but they can see it all their friends

561
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,940
can but they can't so even if they know

562
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,280
that you are there somehow and there is

563
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,539
no way actually to know that you are

564
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,919
there because they can't see your

565
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,960
comments so imagine just going on

566
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,220
writing comments from somebody's picture

567
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,380
everybody is talking about this comment

568
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,000
and they can't even see you why because

569
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,860
you block them but simple thing is for

570
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,720
you are following them so by combining

571
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
those two features just from the UI no

572
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,660
no word proxy nothing at all just go to

573
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,580
the UI block somebody and follow them

574
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,679
and the bug is manifested

575
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,720
you are under account they can't remove

576
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
you you have access to other images and

577
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,220
that's it and now this is stalker dream

578
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,200
come true of course again this is just

579
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,480
because the two flows were nothing maybe

580
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,460
the people implementing the follow flow

581
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,620
and the block flow are totally separated

582
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,480
so they didn't touch each other code

583
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,460
they didn't see how those collaborate in

584
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,840
a sense

585
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,820
so again this is basically about

586
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,140
Instagram

587
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,419
and with this we are done with our case

588
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,340
studies

589
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,080
um I would just like to share some final

590
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,900
Thoughts with you so a good question

591
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,940
would be as a Bug Hunter how to kick off

592
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,919
finding business logic vulnerabilities

593
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,200
for example and I would tell you the

594
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,539
best thing you can do is to use your

595
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,400
thinking hat understand the business

596
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,380
model before you just go on and find

597
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,059
vulnerabilities in a web application or

598
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,980
a mobile application whatsoever

599
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,620
use it as a Norman user for a few days

600
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,220
even up to a few weeks just to make sure

601
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,660
you understand every bit of it you

602
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,220
understand what is important and what is

603
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,280
not important let me give you an example

604
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,320
if you were able for example to find the

605
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,539
email of somebody on Facebook and they

606
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,820
have their emails only me you get I

607
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,500
think now you get around ten thousand

608
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,120
dollars according to their bug Bounty

609
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,980
program so ten thousand dollars because

610
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,320
you get the email of somebody by knowing

611
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,720
their

612
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,059
this is like insane but if you find the

613
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,039
same vulnerability in a company that is

614
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,020
not social media or is not really

615
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,539
critical on this kind of information

616
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,580
uh most probably you are getting nothing

617
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,380
so for example you go to Gmail or to

618
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,299
Google and you tell them okay I can know

619
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,039
the Gmail of people like this is a

620
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,600
service how can you send an email to

621
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,820
somebody without knowing your Gmail it's

622
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,380
not about vulnerability so this is

623
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,480
related to the business model if you

624
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
care about privacy or if you the Privacy

625
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,860
is important to you you pay too much but

626
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,480
if it is a service that you provide by

627
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,980
providing the email address it's really

628
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,419
logical that everybody would know it in

629
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,620
their case

630
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,659
the other thing that comes really in

631
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,640
handy is read a lot of reports and

632
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,220
really hacker one published records is

633
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,960
really a good resource because you can

634
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,799
see what others have found in this topic

635
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,980
and really things more or less repeats

636
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,080
themselves so usually social media

637
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,159
platform would have the same business

638
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,620
model uh e-commerce website would have a

639
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,240
same business model so if you find the

640
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,460
vulnerable in Amazon chances are they

641
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,380
might exist in things like eBay too of

642
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,360
course there is no guarantees but you

643
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,179
can try your luck in that

644
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,500
um about future work and what I'm

645
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,600
planning next So currently I'm working

646
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,120
on some kind of framework to make some

647
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,860
kind of testing on business logic

648
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,960
because uh the issue is business logic

649
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,000
it's really hard to automate this stuff

650
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,860
it's about thinking but what you can

651
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,080
basically do is automate some things

652
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,520
related to your knowledge of business

653
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,440
logic so for example the vulnerability

654
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,940
that I talked about in changing the

655
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,820
price you can automate that you just on

656
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,620
checkout just change the price somehow

657
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,900
so you embed your knowledge into this

658
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,440
kind of framework to automate things

659
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,020
um I'm also working on another very

660
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,539
interesting topic related to uh payment

661
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,460
Integrations and how to use those

662
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,679
payment Integrations to kick off

663
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,720
websites so a really big website can be

664
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,100
kicked off by attacking the payment

665
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,960
integration but this will be coming in

666
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,480
