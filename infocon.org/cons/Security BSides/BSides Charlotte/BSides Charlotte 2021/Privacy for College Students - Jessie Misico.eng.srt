1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,940
hi everyone thank you for being here

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,880
like April said my name is Jessie I'm a

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,679
student I've been for the last couple

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,559
years now but my interest in privacy

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,139
actually started way before that it

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,660
happened to be one of the factors that I

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,580
considered when I was weighing whether

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,320
or not getting a college degree was

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
right for me in the first place and if

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,699
it doesn't now hopefully by the end of

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,199
this talk it'll make a little bit more

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,660
sense why we'll talk a little bit about

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,279
what sort of information colleges

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,940
collect how they use that information

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,380
and some tips for anyone who wants to

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,960
minimize their exposure

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,780
so let's jump right into what sort of

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,420
information colleges collect it all

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,180
starts at the application Phase One of

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,379
the things one of the first things

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,200
you'll do is fill out a FAFSA form this

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
is a free application for federal

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,739
student aid

24
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,680
this is a requirement for obtaining

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,559
student loans grants a lot of

26
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,600
scholarships will also ask you for this

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
information

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,560
some States including the state that I

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,659
live in also make this a requirement to

30
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,820
graduate from high school and what this

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,100
is going to do is it's going to link

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
your tax records with your education

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,820
records and up until you turn 24 not

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,400
only will it have your tax information

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,600
but it'll have your parents tax

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,759
information as well

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,220
now there's a couple exceptions to that

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,880
so if you're married if you have kids if

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,180
you were an emancipated minor then you

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,560
might not have to provide your parents

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,780
tax information but if those don't apply

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,659
to you chances are you'll have to

43
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,299
and the schools get all of the

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,220
information that you provide on this

45
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,040
form including a section where they ask

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,500
you to list the schools that you want to

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,200
make your information available to and

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,420
what they found is that a lot of

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,360
students will actually rank that list

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,100
they'll put those schools in order of

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,439
preference and schools have been known

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,899
to make admissions decisions based off

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,959
of that if they fall very low on the

54
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,640
list you might not get admitted at all

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,099
or if they're high on the list you might

56
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,620
get admitted but they might not offer

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,920
you as much financial aid

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,379
they might also want your sat and your

59
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,440
ACT scores when you provide them with

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,500
that report it'll include your birthday

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,620
your sex your high school and the date

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
and location of your testing and of

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,480
course your scores can affect admissions

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,739
decisions

65
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,739
for me I was a little bit older when I

66
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,200
first enrolled in college so I do need

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
to do this part those scores were

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,459
already a little bit outdated so instead

69
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,620
I just had to take a few placement tests

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,080
so if you don't want to provide those

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,420
scores then you can always reach out to

72
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,099
the school and see if they'll let you

73
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,879
take a placement test instead

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,319
your application is going to be

75
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,379
different for every school but a lot of

76
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,060
your demographic information will

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,860
overlap with what you put on your FAFSA

78
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,280
form besides that they'll probably want

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
to know a little bit more about your

80
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,739
background and about your goals and how

81
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,560
they fit into that

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,500
and then after you get admitted while

83
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,180
you're a student they're going to

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,159
continue to collect information about

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,500
you and I'm sure you can probably guess

86
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,360
what some of that information looks like

87
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,480
they want to keep track of your grades

88
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,180
your achievements any disciplinary

89
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,879
action even in some cases your online

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,019
habits if you're involved in any

91
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,580
organizations or study groups you'll

92
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,560
probably have to download extra software

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,500
like messaging services to keep in touch

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,180
with them and all of those extra

95
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,760
applications are going to also collect

96
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,799
information about you

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,440
and it's really up to the school how

98
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,299
they want to handle approving software

99
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,120
and to what standard of security that

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
needs to live up to your professors are

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,939
given pretty broad discretion when it

102
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,500
comes to requiring software of their

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,260
students for classes I've had to

104
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,839
download things like text editors for

105
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,320
coding classes another very common one

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,080
is proctoring software there's a few

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,660
different ones but what this will do is

108
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,720
it'll make it so that you can't access

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,500
any other applications or browser tabs

110
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,639
besides the exam that you're taking

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
um

112
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,979
and you can see in this screenshot here

113
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,699
canvas has its own built-in doctoring

114
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,639
software so what this allows your

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,639
professor to see is how long you spend

116
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,240
on each question and if you move to any

117
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,580
browser tabs while you're taking this

118
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,340
test now if that seems a little invasive

119
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,160
to you there are some browser extensions

120
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,139
that you can use that will prevent

121
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,780
canvas from being able to see if you're

122
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,840
moving between tabs a forensic

123
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,699
investigator would probably still be

124
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,040
able to see that something is blocking

125
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,280
that but it shouldn't show up on canvas

126
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,020
like this

127
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,300
is available to you if you want it but

128
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,919
really they're going to chalk this level

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,639
of monitoring up to ensuring academic

130
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,840
integrity

131
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,060
they want to make sure that students get

132
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,340
the grades that they deserve and when

133
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,860
you're in person and they can see you

134
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,400
taking a test on paper it's a lot easier

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,860
than when you're virtual and they can't

136
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,720
necessarily see all of that so they're

137
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,479
going to use these extra tools to help

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,240
them out

139
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,039
they might also be interested in your

140
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
employment status so for example for me

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,639
I'm in an apprenticeship so my school

142
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,259
and my employer freely shares

143
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,120
information between each other

144
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
so my employer knows my schedule how

145
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
much I'm paying

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,940
um how I'm doing in my classes they can

147
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,699
even share information like what my

148
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,520
stress levels are like during exams and

149
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,620
if that's affecting my work

150
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,060
I mean of course they would only know

151
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,120
that if I told them but at that level of

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,400
sharing sounds invasive to you then

153
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,720
maybe that's something that you want to

154
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,460
consider when you think about whether or

155
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,560
not you want to go to school and work at

156
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
the same time and how much of that

157
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
activity you want to share between

158
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,800
either party

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,319
now when we talk about how they use

160
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,960
their information there's going to be a

161
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,180
few different laws that will sort of

162
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,400
serve as guiding principles

163
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,699
now I'm not a lawyer so if you want more

164
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,259
information about these laws

165
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,539
specifically I would recommend maybe

166
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,180
going to the source I've included a

167
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,580
couple links to these at the end so you

168
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,800
can find that there

169
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,440
um this is just based off of my

170
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,900
understanding from what I've read

171
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,199
the big one here is this federal law the

172
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,360
family educational rights and Privacy

173
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
Act

174
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,600
this is supposed to protect student

175
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,759
information while they're in school

176
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,060
and this only applies to schools that

177
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,800
accept funding from the Department of

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,199
Education so if you go to a private

179
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,220
school

180
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,139
this might not apply to them although

181
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,880
many private schools do still accept

182
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,400
funding from the Department of Education

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,340
and this grants rights to your parents

184
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,800
to protect your privacy up until you

185
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,860
turn 18 or enroll in college and then

186
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,020
those rights transfer to you you have

187
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,520
the right to access your educational

188
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,740
records

189
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,960
you also have the right to seek to

190
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,539
change those so your school does not

191
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,759
have to change anything they're only

192
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
required to hear you out about it and if

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,759
you and your school disagree about some

194
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,220
of the accuracy of your information you

195
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,080
have to request a hearing and defend

196
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
your position and they can still decide

197
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,360
not to change anything

198
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,819
and sometimes different schools will

199
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,400
have their own policies that require you

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
to request changes within a certain

201
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,940
period of time and you can find their

202
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,300
verbal policies on their website

203
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,479
you should also have control over how

204
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,300
your information is shared except in

205
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,979
certain circumstances and there are

206
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,780
plenty of exceptions we'll go over that

207
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,479
in the next couple slides there's even

208
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,500
more exceptions than these for example

209
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,940
if you're involved in disciplinary

210
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,339
action that might still be reported to

211
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,260
your parents especially if it involves

212
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,600
underage drinking

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,620
also if a faculty member overhears or

214
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
otherwise personally comes across

215
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,640
information about you even if it's in

216
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,580
your student record then that might not

217
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,220
be protected under FERPA anymore and

218
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,320
that's true whether or not you live on

219
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,019
or off campus if you live on campus

220
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,240
there might be higher levels of

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,760
monitoring but even if you don't live on

222
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,040
campus and a faculty member comes to

223
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
find out information about you

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
they can probably share that however

225
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
they want

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,459
one of the big exceptions is this first

227
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,860
one here school officials can access

228
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,500
your personally identifiable information

229
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,300
as long as they have legitimate

230
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,480
educational interest in it now the

231
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,580
school gets to Define what these terms

232
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,820
mean a school official can include

233
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,220
any of the staff at the school and it

234
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,540
can also include anyone that they've

235
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,519
outsourced their work to

236
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,500
so if you want to know how your school

237
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,360
is defining these terms that should also

238
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,339
be on their verbal policy on their

239
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,019
website

240
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,180
also if your parents still claim you as

241
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,000
a dependent on their taxes then they can

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,220
still access your records

243
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,860
now there's one big one that I didn't

244
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,860
put on this slide here and that's

245
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,500
directory information this is what gives

246
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,740
your schools the ability to publish

247
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,200
yearbooks and Student Activities on

248
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,540
their website so this is information

249
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,760
that the school doesn't need your

250
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,680
consent to give out this information

251
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,140
that's not deemed to be private or

252
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,180
harmful to you if it were to be released

253
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,360
and that conclude any of the information

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,000
on the left side of this slide here and

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,980
more your school gets to decide what

256
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,740
they consider directory information

257
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,480
there's a couple things that they're not

258
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,160
supposed to include such as your social

259
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,899
security number

260
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,620
but in 2012 the circumstances expanded

261
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,980
so that your social security number your

262
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,260
grades and other private information can

263
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,480
still be shared with evaluating and

264
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,100
government agencies

265
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,380
who can then re-share your information

266
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,140
in ways that probably isn't going to be

267
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,300
dictated by FERPA if they're not a

268
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,640
educational agency

269
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
so you can find out

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,760
how to opt out of sharing your directory

271
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,560
information and sharing your information

272
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,779
with military recruiters and what the

273
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,360
deadline is to do that by on their

274
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,779
website it might be difficult to find I

275
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,100
know it was difficult to find on my

276
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,860
school's website so if you're having a

277
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,240
hard time with that you could also

278
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,300
probably contact the office of records

279
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,579
and registration and they should be able

280
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,459
to help you out

281
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,380
now before we move on I think that it's

282
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,200
worth noting some laws that may or may

283
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,880
not apply in addition to this Federal

284
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,260
one here

285
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,320
there might be some state laws that also

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,180
protect student privacy that might be

287
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,560
applicable here

288
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,680
it's also very common for schools to ask

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,620
for certain vaccination records

290
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,779
but it's important to keep in mind that

291
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,959
schools are not medical facilities so

292
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,800
hippolas may not apply to them

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
some states also have laws that protect

294
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,019
your Public Library records many of them

295
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,420
do consider your library records to be

296
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,180
private information but that only

297
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,399
applies to public libraries if your

298
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,800
school has a private Library they might

299
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,600
not fall under that

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,820
if you're involved in any registered

301
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,700
student organizations those may not be

302
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,399
subject to FERPA so they could probably

303
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,440
share the information that you give them

304
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,620
however they want hopefully they have a

305
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,300
privacy policy you can check with them

306
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,600
on that but these are student-run

307
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,040
organizations that we're talking about

308
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,899
here

309
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,500
International laws might also apply for

310
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,019
example if you're residing in Europe you

311
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,579
might get some additional privacy

312
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,940
benefits there but that only applies to

313
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,040
the time that you're physically there

314
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,779
the moment you come back to the United

315
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,060
States and continue to share information

316
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,820
about yourself you probably won't be

317
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,560
protected by those European laws anymore

318
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,800
it goes back under FERPA at that point

319
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,339
so with that in mind let's talk about

320
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,579
some of the things that we can do now

321
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,300
there's always going to be some risk if

322
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,519
someone wants your information

323
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,639
they can probably get it but we can make

324
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,100
it harder for them at least nothing's

325
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,579
perfect but we can have some peace of

326
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,339
mind in the case of the data breach by

327
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,600
following some of these steps that's

328
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,160
what the first few bullet points are

329
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,860
about it starts all the way back at the

330
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,720
application process we want to be

331
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
mindful of the information that we

332
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,420
provide there

333
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,940
this might be a good time to provide

334
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,120
some misinformation or the very least a

335
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,399
layer of Separation in case of the data

336
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,480
breach

337
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,720
probably your most private form of

338
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,660
payment is going to be with cash if you

339
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,579
can pay in full at the beginning of the

340
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,000
semester

341
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,920
um and not fill out a FAFSA form that's

342
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,540
probably going to be the best way to do

343
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,820
it but if that's not an option for you

344
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,279
you need to link your bank account

345
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,380
information

346
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,540
to make payments over time one thing

347
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,779
that you can do is give them a masked

348
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,519
debit card

349
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,100
what that is it's a debit card number

350
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,040
that is only linked to your school so if

351
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,920
someone gets that number they can't use

352
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,079
it for anything else besides with your

353
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,240
school

354
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,339
a credit freeze is going to basically

355
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,220
password protect your credit so that

356
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,260
anyone that has too much personally

357
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,720
identifiable information about you won't

358
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,639
be able to use that to open new lines of

359
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,019
credit such as loans or a credit card

360
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,600
a PO box or a commercial mail receiving

361
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
agency is going to protect your physical

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
address where you and your family sleep

363
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,620
at night we do want to be careful with

364
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,959
this one though because a lot of schools

365
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,620
will base your tuition rate on where you

366
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,620
live so if you live in state you might

367
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,380
pay a little bit less than someone who

368
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,880
lives out of state or who lives

369
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,320
internationally

370
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,339
so this PO Box thing it's not meant to

371
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,680
help you get a lower tuition rate it's

372
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
adjustment to protect your physical

373
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
address so your school might require you

374
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
to provide your residential address but

375
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,540
then you should be able to go into your

376
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,060
profile after that and change it to a PO

377
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,959
Box after they set your tuition rate

378
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,000
a Voiceover IP number is going to

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,940
collect is going to protect your phone

380
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,600
number and it will also protect you in

381
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
the

382
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,600
event of a Sim swapping attack they

383
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,480
won't be able to take over your phone

384
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,660
when we choose what sort of classes we

385
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,639
want to take there's going to be some

386
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,160
additional you know things that we want

387
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,620
to keep in mind in regards to our

388
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,980
privacy if you prefer in-person classes

389
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,320
then like I said before there's probably

390
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,360
going to be higher levels of monitoring

391
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,180
on campus you'll also probably have to

392
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,240
use the school's public Wi-Fi but the

393
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,100
nice thing about taking in-person

394
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,199
classes is that you're not necessarily

395
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,540
creating this big digital Trail about

396
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,420
your online habits like you would if you

397
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,660
were taking fully virtual classes

398
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,600
if you do prefer virtual classes you can

399
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,639
choose between synchronous or

400
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,100
asynchronous classes in a synchronous

401
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,019
class that means that you're going to be

402
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,820
meeting with your class and your

403
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,860
professor regularly so you'll probably

404
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,800
have to download teleconferencing

405
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,540
software for that

406
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,880
you will probably also have to download

407
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,420
proctoring software for tests and exams

408
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,779
messaging services for keeping in touch

409
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,060
with your groups for group projects

410
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,820
if you don't like doing any of that

411
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,860
stuff asynchronous classes might be a

412
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,320
good option for you because you're

413
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,040
um

414
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,380
doing your classes completely

415
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,120
independently you're probably not going

416
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,980
to have group projects or proctored

417
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,299
exams or anything like that

418
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,339
when it comes to protecting our digital

419
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,619
devices

420
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,599
um if you don't like using your own

421
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,880
personal device a lot of schools will

422
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,679
have laptop scholarships so you can

423
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,480
probably borrow a laptop for the

424
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,059
semester from your school

425
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,040
regardless of whether or not you use

426
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,079
your own device or use the skulls device

427
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,600
you probably want to use a VPN

428
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,000
especially if you're going to be using

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,299
your campus public Wi-Fi

430
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,120
um you also probably want to use unique

431
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
passwords now your school is going to

432
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,539
manage your accounts so chances are

433
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,760
you're going to have one master password

434
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880
for all of the services that they offer

435
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
you but when you're going through those

436
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,240
and looking through your privacy

437
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,740
settings and adjusting them to your

438
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,740
preferences it might also be worth it to

439
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,960
see if they allow you to reset your

440
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,760
password for that service specifically

441
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,520
and do that whenever possible if you can

442
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
use a password manager it's going to be

443
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,679
a lot easier to keep track of those and

444
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,419
it'll also provide you with passwords

445
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,200
that are much more unique and secure

446
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,460
than anything you could remember

447
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,840
two-factor authentication is also going

448
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,780
to help protect our accounts you can use

449
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,059
a software or a hardware token that's

450
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,100
probably going to be your best bet

451
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,539
if they don't offer those you could have

452
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,600
a code sent to you

453
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,940
it's better than not having two-factor

454
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,059
authentication but whenever possible in

455
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,559
my opinion at least the software or

456
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,000
hardware token is probably going to be

457
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,679
your most secure bet

458
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,860
now I also talked a lot about additional

459
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,919
software that you might have to download

460
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,140
if that does apply to you I recommend

461
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,360
only using those for school related

462
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,820
things and then deleting them at the end

463
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,799
of the semester

464
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,740
if you are required to download things

465
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,140
like proctoring software that you don't

466
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,720
want on your personal device I know I

467
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,220
didn't you can use a virtual machine and

468
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,179
download it on that put a VPN on that it

469
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,740
will

470
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,280
um make it so that when you kill that

471
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,799
session it'll delete your information it

472
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,200
also protects your physical machine and

473
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,820
you can still save your work off of it

474
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,980
it's just going to offer you some

475
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,980
additional privacy and security there

476
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,919
now there's a couple things that I

477
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,260
didn't mention on this that might be

478
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,900
good to keep in mind I'd say maybe you

479
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,580
just don't give them information that

480
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,160
they don't ask for I'll give an example

481
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,679
from my personal experience when I went

482
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,780
to my career services office to get some

483
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,900
feedback about my resume

484
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,640
they were very helpful they provided

485
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,220
some really nice tips for me and then

486
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,799
afterward they went on to post my resume

487
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,580
publicly on their job Board site and I

488
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,380
don't say that to call anyone out or

489
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,059
anything I'm sure that they thought that

490
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,440
what they were doing was very helpful

491
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,960
they say that more is a Learning lesson

492
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,780
that any information that you provide to

493
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,919
them

494
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,220
can probably can be made public so if we

495
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,740
operate under the assumption that any

496
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,220
information will be made public it will

497
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,799
probably help you out in the long run

498
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,620
but even if we do everything on this

499
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,000
list here our biggest area of exposure

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,679
is still probably going to be our social

501
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
media accounts the things that we choose

502
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,600
to post publicly about ourselves so if

503
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,460
you are a social media user it'd

504
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,980
probably be a good idea to just review

505
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,620
your activity and make sure that you're

506
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,240
comfortable with the information that

507
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,700
you've made public I would also maybe

508
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,240
look into how these social media

509
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,799
services

510
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,640
collect your information outside of what

511
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,380
you decide to post how they collect

512
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,960
information about your online habits and

513
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,000
then go back through your old posts as

514
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,700
well and make sure that there's still

515
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,120
current our views don't always age well

516
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,240
and they change as we grow so just go

517
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,500
back through your old posts and make

518
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,620
sure that they still reflect your views

519
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,220
so I hope that some of this information

520
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,280
was new or relevant to you even if

521
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,500
you're not going to college maybe you

522
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,000
have a child or grandchild that is or is

523
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,799
going to and these are the sorts of

524
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,059
things that they're going to have to

525
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,679
deal with when they go

526
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,559
so if you have any questions you can

527
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,140
