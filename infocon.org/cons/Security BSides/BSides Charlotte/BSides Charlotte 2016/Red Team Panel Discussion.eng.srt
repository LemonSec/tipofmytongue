1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,800
buddy for listening to the Badgers of a

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,130
crate

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,009
Thank You Keith or your introductions

4
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:22,449
I'll try to keep mine relatively brief

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,210
so I'm not going to say what companies I

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,039
work for now something to do with

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,410
hammers I did cross paths with him at a

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,049
large banks it looks like Sauron down

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,090
the street although the mic closer to

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,650
your mouth I had called up closer all

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,470
right you got it get really personal so

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,720
I am a manager right now underneath what

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,159
kind of i have i have vulnerability

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:48,850
scanning pentesting war games and what

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,129
is some people call like a red teaming

16
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,739
but more of the red vs. blue can you see

17
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,809
me I just pwned your box did the blue

18
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,089
team actually do things some people call

19
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,689
that purple I will hold off on any of

20
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,199
those comments before i get into that

21
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,330
but those were around the military i I

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,189
to kind of explain how I got into this

23
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,310
role I was a corpsman and fmf corpsman

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,990
so what that means is I was a medical

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,329
person for the Navy I serve many years

26
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,240
with Marines the line units as well and

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,799
in part of that I spent many years

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,259
triaging large pink so large que haces

29
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,499
of mass bodies figuring out how to

30
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,359
figure out which one is priority take

31
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,920
that to what we do now we're looking at

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,960
a mass amount of casualties which one's

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,310
priority right that's what red team

34
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,069
really does in addition I also served in

35
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,240
the National Guard and had a nice little

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,549
time in Iraq with that I come with the

37
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,380
idea of also the op for red teaming

38
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,780
approach were truly the idea the red

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,249
teaming goes in there and we'll hit that

40
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:47,350
in a highlight but I have certain

41
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,929
stances on particularly the colors and

42
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,600
really the effectiveness bringing out to

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,909
the short start what to bank of america

44
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,740
I've before that have also worked SCADA

45
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,840
systems emergency operations for

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,999
Jacksonville North Carolina where camp

47
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,700
lejeune is for six years I've seen

48
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,049
pretty much everything from the fire

49
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,538
departments from power systems to Swift

50
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,840
to ATMs to wireless to all kinds of

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
craziness and we all need red teaming or

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,790
offensive security is probably a better

53
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,120
word for it and I'll stop my rant

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
because I think I'm losing myself in

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,790
here no you're fine the early in the

56
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,500
morning that it's it's not enraged man

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,210
so the first question in both you've

58
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,200
already touched on it is

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,580
what is red teaming there's a lot of

60
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,709
debate about what that is there's a lot

61
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:37,239
of confusion about what that is some

62
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,340
people think penetration testing is red

63
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,230
teaming some people think vulnerability

64
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,849
scanning is red teaming some people

65
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,110
claim that they're doing red team in and

66
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,940
they may not be doing it so from people

67
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,129
who are actually managing red team's can

68
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,290
you now first of all let me say this GDS

69
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,790
they do it from an external perspective

70
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,620
they're doing it where companies are

71
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,660
hired they're hiring GD has to come in

72
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,489
and do it they don't have to deal with

73
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,799
the political aftermath of whatever

74
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,720
whatever is left from the time you

75
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,459
deliver the report whereas Matthew

76
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,870
Becker's managing a team from an

77
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,970
internal perspective and it they're

78
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,489
different it's different management

79
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,780
strategies i guess but there's a lot of

80
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,180
overlap as well so from your perspective

81
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,950
Keith what is what is red teaming so

82
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,030
it's whatever the client wants it to be

83
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,299
ideally it is a no-holds-barred no rules

84
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:31,590
so interdisciplinary so whereas a

85
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,200
typical pentest very siloed is we're

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,840
going to come in loud with our scanners

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,750
in fact we think the client is probably

88
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,780
whitelisted RPS our IP addresses so that

89
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,989
we don't set off alerts and we try to

90
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,989
get as much Brett as possible in a true

91
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,540
red team assessment we are we're going

92
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,430
to cross all those silos we're going to

93
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,319
leverage the network the application the

94
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,819
social engineering the on-site access

95
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,069
and we're going to decide where we take

96
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,970
it and not let them know and so we're

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
where the siloed pentest tend to be loud

98
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,470
and noisy and in and you know we're

99
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,410
coming you don't get a true perspective

100
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,090
on your ability to detect those those

101
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,750
activities and and you know a gauge how

102
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,849
well your team can detect them and then

103
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,320
if they can how are they going to

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,110
respond to them so the the troop in test

105
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,240
I think touches on that aspect that is

106
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,300
not often this often sort of glossed

107
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,200
over

108
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,540
one of the aspects that defines a

109
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,340
penetration test as a penetration test

110
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,740
usually is that it's Tom limited do you

111
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,930
typically have time constraints on a red

112
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,590
team effort from since we were you know

113
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,630
being hired incoming externally that the

114
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,250
time constraint is usually driven by the

115
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,430
budget constraint yeah now if it's if

116
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,410
it's required you if it's part of like a

117
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,870
see best certification there's a defined

118
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,790
scope that you know it has to be what it

119
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,860
has to be but if the client is engaging

120
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,500
us just to voluntarily then then they

121
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,570
can define the the time by the budget

122
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,600
and in some cases they the

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,900
no-holds-barred thing is is flexible as

124
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,660
well you know they may say we are just

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,360
interested in technology so you can look

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,250
at our applications or network etc but

127
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,480
social engineering is off the table ok

128
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,520
Matthew what's red teaming from your

129
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,770
perspective so read to you in my

130
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,510
perspective will pull away all the all

131
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,880
the cool metal of magic pieces basically

132
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,430
it's trying to understand really a full

133
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,960
perspective of all the amount of money

134
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,180
you put into everything and how secure

135
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,370
your business is I really look at it is

136
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,170
if you go back to the history in itself

137
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,570
red comes from the red versus blue kind

138
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,640
of more of the Cold War type of approach

139
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,860
where militaries would act as the as the

140
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,750
opposing force using there's tools

141
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,310
tactics and techniques the people the

142
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,870
way work the equipment they used and

143
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,700
trying to see how they could defend and

144
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,320
actually interact and there was also the

145
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,450
White team we're doing the same thing

146
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,100
really around business I think the one

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,420
of the shifts is we spent a lot of time

148
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,190
on information security but really what

149
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,150
we're doing is we're testing to see

150
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,640
these in IT itself has pretty much

151
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,170
become like the lifeblood of everything

152
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,300
we have our business runs completely on

153
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,820
everything everything from our water

154
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,550
from the the power lines we've seen all

155
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,990
that headline news that stuff's been

156
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,420
going on for 20 years plus but we're

157
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,070
driving with the idea and businesses are

158
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,240
saying it's great let's get rid of

159
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,890
people we don't have to handle them

160
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,450
we've got these machines they're

161
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,890
forgetting these machines are actually

162
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,910
what's running their business it's

163
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,990
what's making their money it's what's

164
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,580
keeping them there it's also making sure

165
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,070
they're getting paid every day so to me

166
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,350
that's what Red Team truly is as we get

167
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,790
into the intermix of the colors and

168
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,290
those pieces i think the pen testing

169
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,689
does actually is a facet

170
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,459
but it's just like organized crime

171
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,080
they're using computers now just like a

172
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,909
gun it's just a tool to get to a means

173
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,860
to finish something if you want to take

174
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,360
into the criminal element there just use

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,099
it to do a crime there's an N stole

176
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,289
there's a there's a human part and also

177
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:07,939
this is one thing I think should be put

178
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,860
into red teaming when we are talking

179
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,149
about it and even some of the pen

180
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,249
testing the behaviors of how they're

181
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:15,229
acting this is also going back to the

182
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,549
purple color we're looking to see how

183
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:17,899
someone actually did something and

184
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,029
compromised it how the script looked on

185
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,399
an nmap or whatever whatever technical

186
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,110
pieces you're actually looking at and

187
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,329
seeing what that reaction is so it's the

188
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,189
full gamut of looking at people process

189
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,409
technology and more of like a business

190
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,899
security or how am i doing after all the

191
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,869
money I've spent one last thing if you

192
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,219
don't have the Volm scans and the pen

193
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,659
test and all the light stuff done before

194
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,459
then don't even buy our bring and red

195
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,929
team it's going to be too easy they're

196
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,069
going to wake make it one way or another

197
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,659
anyway if that's what they're brought

198
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,129
for they're looking for no holds bars

199
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,349
they're looking for social engineering

200
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,149
they're looking for going after badges

201
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,599
they're looking for technology signal

202
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,299
waves psyops you could bring all kinds

203
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,919
of cool things and that's psychological

204
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,809
ops that's a propaganda that type of

205
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,269
stuff you could have all that in there

206
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,499
but if you don't have some of the basics

207
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:08,839
you just wasting money by the way if any

208
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,819
of you have any questions at any point

209
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:11,749
in time even though we're going to

210
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,429
reserve questions or they'll boot some

211
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:14,509
time for questions at the end if you

212
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:15,860
have questions and you're like hey I

213
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,029
want to ask something feel free to raise

214
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,949
your hand jump in its Kelly I'm kidding

215
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,839
yeah and please don't take this as

216
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,429
anything being wrong anyways approach

217
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:23,659
really the whole thing is just

218
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,979
explaining it to other people who are

219
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,479
not in this who are understanding the

220
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,369
pink in the Reds and the hacker you walk

221
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,379
into a room and you say I've worked six

222
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,179
months on us great project and it's

223
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,620
going to be all the money I've spent and

224
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,818
my merits and these are all the metrics

225
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,169
I'm supposed to have to have this

226
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,740
running with the the 590 keeping it up

227
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,448
time and you've walked in there and said

228
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:44,449
I'll you didn't do a lot of stuff

229
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,769
there's a whole there's a hole there and

230
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:47,809
I just shut it all off kind of pisses

231
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,970
people off so the goal is really trying

232
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,500
to help people instead of getting all

233
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,050
scary as a booty man yep no no you're

234
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,300
fine I was just thinking I've heard you

235
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,009
used the term business security before

236
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,019
because it's not just about information

237
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,389
security anymore I'm hoping you will

238
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,320
elaborate on that some in a little bit

239
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,240
so I'm kind of curious show of hands who

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,100
is in offensive security today right now

241
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,170
who's employed making their living doing

242
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,900
that okay and go ahead and put those

243
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,970
down and who is interested in being an

244
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,660
offensive security at some point in time

245
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,770
excellent okay so that makes sense is

246
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,330
there anybody in this room that's not

247
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,830
interested in being in from our

248
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,300
offensive security not interested this

249
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,060
if you've been in a while yeah that's

250
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,840
some point you're like I don't want to

251
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,810
do this anymore yeah but I don't know

252
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,460
what else I'm gonna do right so yeah

253
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,570
yeah we've got the cave picked out we're

254
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:52,300
going totally off-grid right so um where

255
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,130
was I going with that primitive skills

256
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,330
were out there with fire now yeah so

257
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,210
business so I used to work under matthew

258
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,120
up until very recently and he used the

259
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,410
term business security whenever he's

260
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,510
making the case to management why red

261
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,400
teaming is an important activity because

262
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,340
not all businesses have an appetite for

263
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,750
Reggie mean they might say they do but

264
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,130
when it comes down to it they're like oh

265
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,930
yeah we do but you can't touch the

266
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,490
production systems okay well that's not

267
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,440
red t me okay well yeah you can touch

268
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,850
production systems but don't take them

269
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,110
offline well I can't make that guarantee

270
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,840
it may go offline I mean there's no

271
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,670
guarantee that I can't do that so at the

272
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,900
end of the day you either have it might

273
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,340
be a penetration test or it might

274
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,810
actually be a vulnerability scan but

275
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,550
business security encompasses more than

276
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,260
just the IT and Matthew was alluding to

277
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,550
this and I don't want to steal anything

278
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,770
that he's about to say but it gets into

279
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,390
the physical security aspects it gets

280
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,190
into the people which is quite honestly

281
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,690
still the weakest link in any

282
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,570
organization the human element and it's

283
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,670
unfortunate but I don't think we're ever

284
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,100
going to replace humans entirely unless

285
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,020
we go full full on matrix style and plug

286
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,400
people in and we're just using them as

287
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,510
an energy source to power the computers

288
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,690
you laugh but a man it's not that far of

289
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,030
a stretch how would you know if you

290
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,260
weren't there already right now you

291
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,970
might you might actually be plugged in

292
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,620
today yeah now we're get into what is

293
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,120
human and what right that's all done a

294
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
copper totally different panel

295
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,860
discussion right

296
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:26,180
so I'm gonna got a question yeah sure

297
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,480
yeah I'll repeat the question I'm sorry

298
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,980
I started thinking about it but yeah

299
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:17,700
he's asking is there a common pet like

300
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,440
is there a path to win every single time

301
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,800
so I'm gonna take a step back there is

302
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,960
an exact exploit that I would say is a

303
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,940
technological piece I think as a whole

304
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,380
and every cissp and I have been also on

305
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,880
this if talked about it we talk about

306
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,640
Sunzu everybody from ova sunzu art of

307
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,390
war someone will say know thyself right

308
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,700
sounds easy right no one has system

309
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,310
records that right there is the first

310
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,110
problem they don't know what's important

311
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,570
for a lot of them they have a lot of

312
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,700
protocols that are unsecured and it's a

313
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,960
business need and there's a lot of

314
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,000
that's how it was run so don't fail just

315
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,790
keep running a lot of businesses have

316
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,400
continued to drive with an older model

317
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,450
going back to the putting this

318
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,700
technology underneath it just forgetting

319
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,910
that I don't know 1970s we're just

320
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,450
turning into color television it's new

321
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,220
it's a technology we're running on

322
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,820
things are our forefathers and I've got

323
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,350
these are people some of these people

324
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,670
here of like wow this is new technology

325
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,050
if we looked at this years ago it was

326
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,550
like whoo someone's going to go shopping

327
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,950
online it wasn't an idea now it's every

328
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,690
day and we're pushing societies

329
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,940
collectively in that I'm going back to

330
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,590
basically the security there not knowing

331
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,470
how to understand what is their heart

332
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,540
versus their arm how do they cut off and

333
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,730
stay alive that's the biggest problem is

334
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,470
they don't understand the inside the

335
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,480
outside we're still arguing about things

336
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,410
of the MM hard outside squishing inside

337
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,720
don't worry about it the adversaries are

338
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,970
just going to on the outside Lance

339
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,740
actually had the old model of the castle

340
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,410
they still think we're in a castle on a

341
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,200
global scale that's the problem i see

342
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,960
collectively is one exploit i don't

343
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,740
personally have one atop my list okay ya

344
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,260
know I from a technology only

345
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,080
perspective I would say no there's not

346
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,050
really you know in the the early days of

347
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,680
the internet and security it was common

348
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,450
to attack the network perimeter you had

349
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,590
firewalls that failed open and so

350
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,810
everybody focused on you know patching

351
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,390
that fixing that and then so the attacks

352
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,040
moved up to the application layer you've

353
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
got sequel injection cross-site

354
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,450
scripting if started to do a better job

355
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,070
patching that and so it keeps you know

356
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,160
moving up the stack so I would say if

357
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
there's anything that we we find that's

358
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,570
common across all of them it's pushing

359
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,140
beyond that technology stack into the

360
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,270
layer eight you know the humans the

361
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,810
social engineering and if i were to back

362
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,550
you know back into the technology stack

363
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,030
a little bit it would be administrative

364
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,300
interfaces that are exposed externally

365
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,840
that just have a simple user name and

366
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,230
password for logging in which is not a

367
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,510
vulnerability in a in and of itself it's

368
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,340
um you know it's not going to be picked

369
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,240
up by your volunteer probably but it's

370
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,280
it that's where we can then tie those

371
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,140
two together the social engineering

372
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,450
where we can fish them for credentials

373
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,020
and then go back to that administrative

374
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,580
login interface that should be locked

375
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,860
down with two factor authentication or

376
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,380
even ideally you know

377
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,180
behind the firewall where requires VPN

378
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,470
so the question was I just want to make

379
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,180
sure that and make sure the people back

380
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,980
there understand what it is and these

381
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,720
guys as well you've heard a lot of

382
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,640
problems with active directory and you

383
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,320
want to know if that comes up as a path

384
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,390
to success for own in the organization

385
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,510
active directory is definitely a target

386
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,580
a very rich target because everything's

387
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,250
managed from there right yes yes I was

388
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,300
trying to figure out where the voice was

389
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,260
coming from yes oh really yeah it's a

390
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,930
credential question right the Bulls down

391
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,440
to password strength or i can let one of

392
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,580
these guys saying oh you're doing

393
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,830
you go it's a a lot of times you don't

394
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,030
even need the password if you got the

395
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,220
hash you can pass the hash attack it's

396
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,540
it's an attack where you take the hash

397
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,400
and you feed it to another system and it

398
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,770
just okay yeah you're so-and-so come on

399
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,900
in and once you do that to a domain

400
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,340
controller if you have a domain admin

401
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,260
credential then you've got the entire

402
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,960
domain and once you've got that it's

403
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,340
pretty much only organization so to

404
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,109
speak you own that system you own that

405
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,089
Network now you own that entire company

406
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,189
and if you're an ethical hacker then you

407
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,420
put it in your report and if you're

408
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,760
another kayaker you too bad and

409
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,760
malicious things to them right so the

410
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,079
teams that these guys are running our

411
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,500
ethical hackers they're trying to let

412
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,520
the organization know that these

413
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,800
problems exist before hand let's see

414
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,150
I've lost my place the so I'm kind of

415
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,490
curious what pushbacks do you get from

416
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,370
management whenever you when when you

417
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,990
start talking about red team efforts and

418
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,250
Keith I don't know if you do you

419
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,710
experience pushback from management

420
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,760
because I mean they're coming to you and

421
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,780
they're saying hey we want you to do

422
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,280
this and then you you say okay well

423
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,020
here's our plan do you get pushed back

424
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,530
from them not so much once they've once

425
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,940
they've engaged us they've already

426
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,160
internally committed to it I would think

427
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,440
the only the only push back we might

428
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,700
receive is

429
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,889
they start off with pie-in-the-sky ideas

430
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,799
you know we want the the full red team

431
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,380
experience no holds barred you tellin

432
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,659
price and any well yeah you look cheaper

433
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,490
yeah exactly yeah yes faster cheaper

434
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,960
yeah what about what about an internal

435
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,220
red team perspective what kind of

436
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,260
challenges do you face from maybe maybe

437
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,639
the piers that you're working with in

438
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,279
addition to management above and you can

439
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,210
talk broad you don't have to talk about

440
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,700
current area which approach is the

441
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,679
easiest approach so I get the luxury

442
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,169
unfortunately you get to hey here's your

443
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,480
report have a nice day call me if you

444
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,480
want I get the luxury of here's a report

445
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,799
here's a bunch of extra work that you've

446
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,080
already had and you already had a your

447
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,850
performances in your evals already based

448
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,710
on how much you're doing to build things

449
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,299
into production now I've slowed down

450
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,480
everything or depending on many

451
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,429
companies they have this this this green

452
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,260
this great idea that we're going to

453
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,880
gonna stop businesses from putting

454
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,559
things out in production without any

455
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,460
defects yeah you try telling an SVP who

456
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,200
thinks that they own the world and that

457
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,059
their or their job is the reason the

458
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,889
company runs that they're not being able

459
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,419
to push out their big project they've

460
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,789
been boasting about so um that can

461
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,220
definitely be a challenge I will pause

462
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,590
there however and I am going to use a

463
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,299
word that sounds weird in the red

464
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,840
teaming and my own little aluminum hat

465
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,299
NSA I am if you haven't dug that up it's

466
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,610
an old book that the NSA put out for

467
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,720
information assurance methodology in

468
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,309
essence basically what it is it's the

469
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,990
best way to try to understand the

470
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,850
worst-case scenario in your pre

471
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,409
assessment of finding out what that

472
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:44,559
person cares about ask them for to

473
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,090
negate this problem you need to

474
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,320
understand the business you need to

475
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,639
understand their pain points their

476
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:51,250
problems their scare the more you can

477
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,720
figure out how to make your exploits

478
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,389
correlate to that the easiest they'll be

479
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,190
able to digest that pill otherwise

480
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,090
you'll just say cross-site scripting

481
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,110
over there that's cool what does that

482
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,769
mean let's go take out your business we

483
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,539
also have lots of talks on social

484
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,590
engineering if you can social engineer

485
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,690
and SVP to be like I

486
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,070
understand this is going to take down my

487
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,500
business I could go to jail that stuff

488
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,610
that helps not always I've also had

489
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,590
challenges sometimes of just leadership

490
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,030
and it's also goes back to the colors

491
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,100
and I want a pink team versus a red team

492
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,870
trying to explain sometimes the

493
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,070
management why you need things like

494
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,020
get-out-of-jail-free card because they

495
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,790
think collectively that their enterprise

496
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,530
and there are instances as the

497
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,590
overarching laws and anything within as

498
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,810
does for brick-and-mortar pieces covers

499
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,720
you it doesn't I mean would you feel

500
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,340
safe without going without at least some

501
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,110
paper saying I'm supposed to be here we

502
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:50,040
would never do that no question

503
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,220
and there's one other compounding piece

504
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,990
of this thing called CNN and Fox News

505
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,110
that just scares everyone so we're

506
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,500
hyperaware media side well it does play

507
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,630
into it because depending on where the

508
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,250
background of the law enforcement they

509
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,730
and being with my my military background

510
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,920
in millet mehreen core some of them when

511
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,360
they turn in transition they want to be

512
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,340
due diligent could be a good thing but

513
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,420
sometimes it adds to it so taking the

514
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,380
law back and I'm going to make sure I

515
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,880
try to answer the question and if I

516
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,290
didn't answer please ask al in a

517
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,390
different way when I'm going back to the

518
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,250
get out of jail free card in our aspect

519
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,780
looking at a bank you have the idea that

520
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,670
you can go into that bank and you can go

521
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,290
and play with like their ATMs because

522
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,990
it's got their logo on it right however

523
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,570
once that turns in once something goes

524
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,850
into it it becomes monetary money it

525
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,360
becomes United States law enforcement

526
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,010
takes that as a different approach now

527
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,570
you're doing money laundering in other

528
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,940
places in there where does that that

529
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,200
blend into how they're going to

530
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,450
incarcerate you because they don't

531
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,160
understand and you're now breaking

532
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,710
something that's now federal law versus

533
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,910
a civilian allowance is that where you

534
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,820
were going with the question so in that

535
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,560
that is also some of the challenges you

536
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,390
have to explain to management that it

537
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,730
isn't the myopic or the very short I've

538
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,170
been arrested and I have a piece of

539
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,480
paper it's what's going to happen

540
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,560
afterwards when they start prosecuting

541
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,900
you that you have actually illegal

542
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,460
backing that there's something out of it

543
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,260
in addition they also have to understand

544
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,660
why you're incarcerated there's no red

545
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,950
teaming going on so that money they

546
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,170
spend on you just wasting away so hang

547
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,070
on an internal red team they have a

548
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,050
title of a red team they have a manager

549
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,610
to manage the red team they hire people

550
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,470
with the skill sets to do red teaming

551
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,790
they still have to make a case

552
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,520
internally for being able to read team

553
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,100
the organization there are cases of

554
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,959
those yes that's so interesting okay

555
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,460
it once you've been doing Red Team you

556
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,290
long enough you probably that's going

557
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,650
with them it it seems I because you know

558
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,080
and if they're putting forth the job

559
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,610
descriptions they're hiring the talent

560
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,660
they're seeking out there doing the

561
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,890
interviews they have the funding it

562
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,790
seems like they've already made the

563
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,700
decision to employ the the people with

564
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,960
that skill set that do those things

565
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
against the organization so they can

566
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,800
identify the weaknesses before the the

567
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,060
people that are on their payroll

568
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,790
identify those issues and they end up in

569
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,060
the news some of those are and nothing

570
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,130
against any of the instructors and and

571
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,560
the end the piers sands there you look

572
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,000
the marketing they say I need pen

573
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,730
testing and red teaming get us one cool

574
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,490
we got one pci osc p we need one I don't

575
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,450
know what it's going to do but we need

576
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,400
one and they don't understand really

577
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,620
what that held it in place in their

578
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,870
business what exactly it is information

579
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,120
security is still some companies are

580
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,500
still like having problems of the old

581
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,390
antivirus we put an antivirus in there

582
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,670
now we have resource problems maybe you

583
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,140
should upgrade that resource instead of

584
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,920
saying turn off the antivirus got a

585
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,580
question over here

586
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:57,309
yes I'll actually let you search your

587
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,269
wife sure I mean yes that happens

588
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,299
sometimes well we we try to point out

589
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:06,460
where those weaknesses are and what

590
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,700
they're getting for their money and and

591
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,039
then ultimately you know they make that

592
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,359
decision so I'm not sure what I'll stand

593
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,779
to that well it sounds like it's going

594
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,669
back to definition though and I had it

595
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,679
and I didn't ask it but so what is a

596
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,200
penetration test what defines a

597
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,690
penetration test as opposed to say a

598
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,580
product assessment or a vulnerability

599
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,190
scan how do you differentiate

600
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,109
penetration test from a vulnerability

601
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,509
scan or vulnerability assessment right

602
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:41,769
so we've touched on the the

603
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:45,789
no-holds-barred access in the look go

604
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:48,580
ahead oh sorry yeah and the

605
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,729
interdisciplinary nature of it what your

606
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,820
I think another key difference is

607
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,879
instead of you know going a mile wide

608
00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:00,970
and an inch deep you're you're we're

609
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,590
going to do reconnaissance we're going

610
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,419
to find figure out where we're going to

611
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,269
focus and so we're going to maybe miss

612
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:08,679
you know we're not going to look at

613
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:09,820
something over here but we're going to

614
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,619
we're going to identify this is we think

615
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,629
this is a promising vector and then

616
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:15,909
we're going to see how deep you know we

617
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,830
can take it and we're going to try to do

618
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,849
it as as quietly as we can just like an

619
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,919
actual attacker would so you're going to

620
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,049
that that's the so you're talking about

621
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:27,639
red team unit that's sorry I

622
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,259
misunderstood well the question was what

623
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,859
is the penetration test and so hang on

624
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,749
yeah I got one thing to add here I've

625
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,729
heard it explained this way the

626
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,989
difference between a penetration test

627
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:41,349
and a red team activity would be post

628
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,359
exploitation what do you do after you've

629
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,059
popped the box so to speak right because

630
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,499
at least in my experience and probably

631
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,759
some of the other people sitting in this

632
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,970
room a penetration test is tom limited

633
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,950
and you have specific targets and you're

634
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,570
not really generally allowed to touch

635
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,620
any targets that are

636
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,930
satta scope I see a few nods going so

637
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,760
that's more or less a penetration test

638
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,559
the vulnerability assessment would

639
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,360
include like a vulnerability scanner

640
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,450
which knows about some common problems

641
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,850
and ways to identify them and it

642
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,830
generates a mountain of information and

643
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,230
a vulnerability assessment might include

644
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,210
going like manually going through those

645
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,740
in determining if these are valid

646
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,690
vulnerabilities or are they false

647
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,490
positives within your environment I

648
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,390
think do we agree on this so far okay so

649
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,000
a red team exercise would be once you're

650
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,460
successfully penetrated a system what

651
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,320
other systems is that system connected

652
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,520
to what things of value or on that

653
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,960
system and how could you use that to

654
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,390
further damage the organization does

655
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,150
that sound about right very much no yeah

656
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,070
I think so so you're speaking more to

657
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,660
once you've once you've gained that

658
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,059
foothold you haven't you've proved you

659
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:54,550
can pop the box right so that would be a

660
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,990
successful penetration that's that's a

661
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,809
pen test so now we're pivoting from that

662
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,840
point and seeing how he'll help how far

663
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,240
we can go and what can we find what can

664
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,690
we get and then once we get it so that's

665
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,550
your ingress find the data and then

666
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,110
we're looking for a sustained to egress

667
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,170
and can we do all of that undetected

668
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,630
undetected so that make sense okay do

669
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,510
you have anything to add to that because

670
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,880
there's there's a lot of confusion about

671
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,590
the definitions I think still and

672
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,110
there's still you could even and I saw

673
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,309
the question there still you could even

674
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,440
with the pen test there's the

675
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,730
application pen test which is myopically

676
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,860
around just the application in itself

677
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,450
and then you're looking at the full

678
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,400
scale of how integration of the pen test

679
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,050
and what you're talking about could

680
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,910
almost be goal-oriented pen testing

681
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,740
because it didn't have the physical and

682
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,450
the other pieces but it's getting at

683
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,390
least deeper in the dive and whatever

684
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,880
terms use the challenges really is just

685
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,160
making sure it's common consistent

686
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,350
English or for them to understand it

687
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,910
that's really the crux you can call what

688
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,470
you need whatever is easiest way to

689
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,570
explain it it's just if we're not

690
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,940
explaining that we can't explain really

691
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,220
the value of it right at the end

692
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,409
so what so what you're heading on is

693
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,699
risk appetite what is their risk

694
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:47,019
appetite which is what I was talking

695
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,459
about on the pre part of trying to

696
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:49,839
figure out their worst case scenario

697
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,339
understanding their businesses the

698
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:53,529
process is the technology that run those

699
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,329
businesses what you're talking about is

700
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,279
the is exactly right and not to

701
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,959
negate that resources and making sure

702
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,579
this this low hanging fruit are taken

703
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,889
care of but what we're trying to do if

704
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:04,149
we're collectively the red teaming

705
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:07,629
pentesting ends result of impacts is

706
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:08,979
we're really trying to understand what

707
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:11,109
the business is what is their cares if

708
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:12,699
it's just dachstein a bunch of

709
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,979
information out of there seems to be

710
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:16,599
important because they're droning people

711
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,959
for it whatever but if they're worried

712
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,089
about actually like I use this system

713
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,159
that happens to push out inventory to

714
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,759
cross 15 15 states that right there is

715
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,979
the stopper it may not be I've docks

716
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:32,409
their their HR stuff or not there they

717
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:33,819
also have a lot of this liability

718
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:35,949
especially a lot of the fortune 250

719
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:38,109
companies they have this money thats it

720
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:41,229
aside just for the oh crap happens so

721
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:43,749
that might not be it the business driver

722
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:45,579
shutting down their business finding out

723
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:48,339
what shuts them down for a bank it's not

724
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,869
the stock market what they worried about

725
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:51,729
is a bank run no one having money in it

726
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:53,619
that means they've lost all trust they

727
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:55,059
spent how much money marketing on it

728
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:56,889
they spend how much money on getting

729
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:58,959
spotlights for her like the NFL spot how

730
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,149
much money is that cost that's there in

731
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,909
there's that's the impact if I'm able to

732
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:05,919
get a Twitter account and cause a mass

733
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,079
media and cause a run and you spent how

734
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,549
many millions of dollars on marketing

735
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:10,869
and trying to get those contracts and

736
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:13,959
the slots you've lost that money and the

737
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,429
additional money you have to do to react

738
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:25,660
to it yeah go ahead sure

739
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:37,960
oh that was the NSA I am it's it's still

740
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,100
kind of floating around I think it's

741
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,900
excited started to die off there's also

742
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,610
a spider into I think they have a red

743
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,500
teaming module as well I haven't taken

744
00:32:44,500 --> 00:33:07,210
that one unfortunately what was the

745
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:15,460
stand what was the standard depends on

746
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,960
the industry it really depends on each

747
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,940
each industry each company will pick

748
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,230
their own framework and model that

749
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,240
they're kind of adhering to not saying

750
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,000
you can't use that as the best practices

751
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,290
honestly for what for a red teaming and

752
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,760
what I would do is I try to understand

753
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,200
all of them because HIPAA Sox basil

754
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,180
which may seem if you talk to most bank

755
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,950
people the technology is a very small

756
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,270
piece of it but you're talking about

757
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,710
liquidity and credit and having no

758
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,200
people there being able to pay the bills

759
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,640
kind of bad for them I'm not familiar

760
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,740
with it standard so it's like so yeah

761
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:57,400
but yeah L isn't yeah read it understand

762
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,410
it Sakura is a good start yeah

763
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,139
I would agree with that so I think I try

764
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,940
to remember it was somebody from the NSA

765
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,830
or somebody spoke recently and said that

766
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,159
you know everybody thinks that that

767
00:34:48,159 --> 00:35:07,340
using zero-day vulnerability holes is is

768
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,710
not going to protect you and I think the

769
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,170
other thing goes back to the

770
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,000
interdisciplinary nature of these red

771
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,270
team assessments what we what we try to

772
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,280
do is take two three four of those those

773
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,310
medium risk rated vulnerabilities that

774
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,710
you're you're probably more likely to

775
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,350
risk accept and just ignore and then

776
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,990
chain those together and and that's

777
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,890
that's how we get in that is actually

778
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,600
key it's the storytelling it's these

779
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,270
myopic one small pieces that start one

780
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,450
thing that pivots to x y&z that this one

781
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,160
device that says all only three people

782
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,930
log into it but it's connected to an

783
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,640
upstream or downstream to something that

784
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,080
happens to me I don't know the

785
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,180
omni-channel of everyone's driving

786
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,710
because they want to have everyone's

787
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,470
customer from wiping your butts and

788
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,000
knowing I need toilet paper to tell your

789
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,410
frigerator to literate I don't know

790
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,120
whatever scenario case they want to come

791
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,220
up with but yep hey why not putting

792
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,020
we're putting web servers and toaster so

793
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,200
why not

794
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,910
if if the customer can define it that's

795
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,190
that's the goal that's the best way to

796
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,130
do it right if they can't you try to

797
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,250
help them get to some sort of go if they

798
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,040
still can't then for me personally I'm

799
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,530
trying to back down and you know it's

800
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,210
not even a goal-oriented penetration

801
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,220
test at that point it might be we can

802
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,200
look and see what is there and we can

803
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,640
report on that right if they unless they

804
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,440
have the appetite to just go full bore

805
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,109
and go ham on the stuff then then you go

806
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,930
ham and report what you find right I

807
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:57,800
don't know right right right yep

808
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:09,380
all lifelock and that and the class

809
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,150
action suits are becoming extremely

810
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,580
common now the lawyers are all over that

811
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:22,850
so hang on one second we've got a little

812
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,260
bit of time left and there was one

813
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,940
question that I think is probably on

814
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,830
some folks minds so skill sets when

815
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,050
you're looking to hire people what skill

816
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,850
sets are you looking at what are you

817
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,820
looking anything in particular or just

818
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,410
what are you looking for and people that

819
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,730
you hire for your team so you because

820
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,590
it's interdisciplinary you know it's a

821
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,620
red team we're not looking for a you

822
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,690
know somebody that's got a you know one

823
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,090
particular skill set you know we're

824
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,830
looking for people who are somebody

825
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,150
who's good in network somebody who's

826
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,770
good in application somebody's good at

827
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,980
social engineering and specific you know

828
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:02,480
maybe windows gaya Linux guy but so a

829
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,730
variety of skill sets that can work

830
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,400
together I think you know we're looking

831
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,490
for people who have a really deep

832
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,340
knowledge of their domain so because one

833
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,110
of the things that we're trying to avoid

834
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,780
is detection you can't hire somebody

835
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,210
that just is going to come in with

836
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,820
default settings and yeah guns blazing

837
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,460
they have to know the the limitations of

838
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,470
the tool how to tune it to to fly under

839
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,710
the radar low and slow what tools they

840
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,270
can't use it all because they're going

841
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,450
to have signatures that set off alarms

842
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:44,000
that kind of stuff Matthew so in

843
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,350
addition to the technical stuff you

844
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,790
highlighted things I look for

845
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,430
particularly is people who understand

846
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,130
psychology psychology of themselves what

847
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,390
is that carrot that gets them up every

848
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,290
day being in this fields for 20 ish

849
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,450
years everyone asks you how you got here

850
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,330
how do you hack I want to be information

851
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,980
security I want to do it I tell them if

852
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,850
you want to keep banging your head on

853
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,800
the wall and you're bleeding and you

854
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,240
like that that's your passion keep going

855
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,350
for it that's what I'm looking for

856
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,140
because it is it's

857
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,520
when you're arguing with your bosses

858
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,920
about trying to articulate risk and

859
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,960
saying this is important and they're

860
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,980
going to push back you're playing

861
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,930
devil's advocate I also look for people

862
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,870
who understands processes looking for

863
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,090
holes and things because really what

864
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,170
we're doing is we're looking for the

865
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,810
technology to stop a process to

866
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,350
articulate something for that so one of

867
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,570
the questions I'll ask is what makes a

868
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,100
good information security professional

869
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,540
it's one of the common questions I ask

870
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,460
I'm not looking for all someone can just

871
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,690
tell me that I can do a cross-site

872
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,870
scripting enjoy a pop-up box because the

873
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,430
executives don't even know what that

874
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,410
pop-up box is let alone how to turn the

875
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,770
computer on still it's not going to help

876
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,660
them all right and it goes actually the

877
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,340
question and I'll keep this brief but

878
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,260
what is the success of a team or a team

879
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,810
one you've got the client so even in an

880
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,700
internal team part of the job is your

881
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,720
pedaling and your looks like a

882
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,760
consultant hey I'm here to destroy your

883
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,290
stuff will you let me come to destroy

884
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,270
your stuff it's really what was going on

885
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,520
you have to understand their goals and

886
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,810
making sure they get a report in

887
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,790
addition especially for the inside you

888
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,080
also have the other metrics how many

889
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,820
defects you found how what's your

890
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,280
rotation of operational like you did 18

891
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,430
assessments this week do 16 more those

892
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,600
are the battles you're still fighting

893
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,480
because you're still getting equated to

894
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,310
everyone else how many buttons did you

895
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,740
push so trying to figure out how to tell

896
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,840
that and success the story the one last

897
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,060
thing is also making sure being working

898
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,380
in what we're doing diverse skills

899
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,330
diverse thought especially when you get

900
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,620
more than two people together so you

901
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,270
don't get group think they start getting

902
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,550
their they're different individuals you

903
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,200
have to be able to understand them their

904
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,730
skill sets and how to empower them to

905
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,260
grow and that that's a key yeah and I

906
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,160
would I guess add so when when part of

907
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,430
our interview interview process gds is

908
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,480
we we throw up spin up a intentionally

909
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,870
vulnerable application give you 24 hours

910
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,740
to just do a quick pin test on it and

911
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,750
then another 24 hours to write a report

912
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,670
and deliver it to us and we get on the

913
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,810
phone and you play the part of the

914
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,040
consultant and we play the part of the

915
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,370
client and so one of the things we look

916
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,950
for is how you deliver it how you do the

917
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,880
risk ratings how you

918
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,010
you explain the finding and I think this

919
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,230
goes to the the goal oriented question

920
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,720
as well and and how do we what do we go

921
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,750
after and and how do we present it so if

922
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,820
you can get domain creds that's great

923
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,050
that's going to impress the the

924
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,880
technical people but the business guy

925
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,680
that owns the application and where runs

926
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,000
the businesses can be like what what

927
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,270
does that mean so if we can we can get

928
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,940
in and use those domain creds to pull

929
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,190
out health records or you know something

930
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,080
sensitive and show that as evidence that

931
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,280
you know than that that helps them

932
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,300
understand so when we do these these

933
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,810
interview app pin tests I look for for

934
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,780
those type of somebody that can explain

935
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,450
the vulnerability in business terms and

936
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,360
also risk rates it appropriately so for

937
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,460
example you touched on you know just

938
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,170
cross site scripting and showing that

939
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,980
you can pop up a box that's great so I

940
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,870
get reports all the time where somebody

941
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:23,310
rates cross-site scripting as a critical

942
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,020
right well it turns out in this

943
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,300
particular case all they could do is

944
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,990
reflect it back at themselves right so

945
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,420
what you know what's what's the business

946
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,430
risk there and and maybe it's still a

947
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,020
valid vulnerability but maybe you want

948
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,310
to bump it down a couple notches maybe

949
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,970
it's a medium or and then describe

950
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,430
explain that scenario walk me through

951
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:48,430
how the attackers actually going to

952
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,960
leverage that to get to the business

953
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,740
assets not the technical assets hang on

954
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,040
one second well but because the question

955
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,310
always comes up certificates and I know

956
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,130
that's kind of it's a fun discussion and

957
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,540
that's had it almost every conference

958
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,340
I've ever been to but is there any

959
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,950
minimum level certificate requirements

960
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,930
that either of you have of candidates

961
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,040
you're looking for there's not for us we

962
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,990
don't have a requirement it's it's

963
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:21,310
definitely a bonus I think the the OS CP

964
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,390
has has a lot of prestige for us a

965
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,050
genius yeah it's it's a certificate

966
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,610
produced by all offensive security if

967
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,930
you haven't heard of it you should check

968
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,200
it out the PCI standard now lists as one

969
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,420
of the qualifying markers of somebody

970
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,289
who can perform

971
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:40,329
an actual assessment that they consider

972
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:43,779
good Keith mentioned a company or an

973
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:47,349
organization out of Europe crest yeah

974
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:50,799
see best see best yeah and I don't know

975
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:53,589
a whole lot about them but they do one

976
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:56,829
for one with the offensive security Oh

977
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:58,630
SCP certificate remember their

978
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,380
entry-level penetration test so yeah

979
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,729
it's it does have quite a bit of

980
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:06,579
prestige right now and with good reason

981
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,890
it's an incredibly difficult certificate

982
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,539
to achieve and then we have a few in the

983
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:12,880
room here so if you want if you want to

984
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,469
talk to people there are people here

985
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:16,799
today that can answer questions about it

986
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:19,569
go ahead Matthew oddly enough other

987
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:21,719
certifications you just IT related

988
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,859
actually helps as well so if you happen

989
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,630
to be a ccie in those type of areas

990
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,069
because if you're talking to another

991
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:29,529
ccie already built that rapport you

992
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:31,269
already have that technology and you

993
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:32,589
have to understand the systems as well

994
00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:35,619
so don't negate any other certification

995
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:36,699
and just think that you need to get a

996
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:38,259
security certification you need to

997
00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:40,749
understand and deep dive into all of it

998
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:43,659
and understand how the interconnect so

999
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:46,449
what I've heard so far is experience is

1000
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:48,579
probably the number one thing you guys

1001
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,069
are looking for so you're not going to

1002
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:52,329
typically hire somebody right out of

1003
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:53,709
college to do this line of work unless

1004
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,529
they've been unless they're just really

1005
00:45:56,529 --> 00:45:57,669
really good at what they do and they

1006
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:59,439
pedal you know they've studied it since

1007
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:00,849
there was a kid here yesterday by the

1008
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:03,009
way in Doug's exploit development class

1009
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:05,650
13 years old I don't I don't know how

1010
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,749
well he was doing but I I'm imagine he

1011
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:10,269
did fairly well in the class I think he

1012
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,589
probably set back there and pwned all

1013
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:21,489
the old farts but 13 years old by the

1014
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:23,499
time if he continues on this path by the

1015
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:25,900
time he's 18 let's say and he's willing

1016
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,549
to go you know he's looking for a job

1017
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,349
there's a pretty good chance he could

1018
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:32,650
get on with you know pretty pretty what

1019
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,869
would be take most people 15 10 15 years

1020
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:36,729
worth of work experience to get into

1021
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:38,229
because he's our he started so young

1022
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,359
right and he's doing it at a time

1023
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,829
whenever it's all just seeping right

1024
00:46:41,829 --> 00:47:02,409
into his brain question back there we

1025
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:05,259
would be very cautious about hiring

1026
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:08,669
anybody that's got black hat experience

1027
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:12,279
we you know we deal with very large

1028
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,249
financial technology healthcare

1029
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,380
companies that are going to do

1030
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,529
background checks we do background

1031
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:23,469
checks and some of our clients do even

1032
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:25,449
more rigorous but background checks so

1033
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:32,409
that could that could become an issue as

1034
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:35,229
a blanket statement i would say i would

1035
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:37,299
agree a lot of the being and inside

1036
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:38,919
you're stuck with the other HR

1037
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:43,419
regulations i do think though that also

1038
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:45,159
because of the legal system collectively

1039
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,529
and determine of pet black hat it also

1040
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:50,199
could be situational basis it could have

1041
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,309
been that someone did something that

1042
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,469
wasn't really hacking but it's equated

1043
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:55,209
to hacking that some lawyer said i'm a

1044
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:58,150
hacker prosecute having at least that

1045
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,219
conversation it also goes back to the

1046
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:01,239
other question about information

1047
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:03,609
security and how their demeanor is how

1048
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:05,859
they seem to act themselves how

1049
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:08,799
collectively their ethics portray out of

1050
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:10,419
it because going back to what he was

1051
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:12,969
talking about that the the challenges if

1052
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:14,169
you already have someone known as a

1053
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:16,439
black hacker unless you're kevin Mitnick

1054
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:20,619
they're going to be scared yeah I would

1055
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:21,939
agree with that it's like I said we

1056
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:24,039
would approach it very cautiously the

1057
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,659
challenge maybe you know even if we

1058
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:28,749
believe you're now a white hat we've

1059
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:30,939
still got a you know you've got to be

1060
00:48:30,939 --> 00:48:33,249
marketable to our clients so we would

1061
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:34,209
have to take that on a case-by-case

1062
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,140
basis

1063
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,960
and then I wanted to touch back on your

1064
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,480
comment previously on not hiring out of

1065
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,850
college we actually do hire some people

1066
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,130
directly out of college I don't know how

1067
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,780
many any of that applies to anybody here

1068
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,580
but okay good but typically those are

1069
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,850
people who live and breathe it and do it

1070
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,100
outside of the classroom it's you know

1071
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,630
it's they're not just going to show us

1072
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,380
their their class you know their grades

1073
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,410
you know we ask questions like you what

1074
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,820
come you know what network do you run at

1075
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,010
home what you know what is your

1076
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,230
involvement with with local campus or

1077
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,870
you know organizations if you've if

1078
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,820
they've started you know their own a

1079
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,180
wasp campus organization you know really

1080
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,340
a high level of dedication that they

1081
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,480
live and breathe it outside of the

1082
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,000
classroom besides it involved in visa

1083
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,710
odds yes yeah that too so I'm going to

1084
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,690
plug a couple of local organizations if

1085
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,010
you're if you're young and you're in

00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,150
and it is a great way to demonstrate

1103
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,060
your to increase your skills and to

1104

00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,430
1018 eight anybody younger than eight no

1125
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:20,170
I was seven myself one anyway yeah I had

1126
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:25,500
a UH anyway it was a Commodore 16 anyway

1127
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,300
good times I had no storage anything I

1128
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,560
had to write I had to rewrite it every

1129
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,510
time I wanted to run it and we can talk

1130
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,580
about that later let's see any other

1131
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,040
questions okay let's do that one there

1132
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,350
cuz I saw his hand first black shirt

1133
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,529
yeah

1134
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,700
so the question was in case did

1135
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,940
everybody hear it okay I'll repeat it

1136
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,010
the question was is what is the

1137
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,400
advantage of using a red team either an

1138
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,230
internal red team or an external red

1139
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,410
team vs a company doing bug bounty

1140
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,750
programs like bugcrowd or hacker one or

1141
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,430
any any of the other flavors that are

1142
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:21,980
out there today so I would take it as

1143
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,210
controlled cast from a business

1144
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,850
perspective hiring a red team you're

1145
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,800
able to actually have a point of contact

1146
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,630
and collectively get some scope and

1147
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,280
understanding of what your concerns are

1148
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,930
the bug bug the bug grub project

1149
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,790
definitely has it has its value but it's

1150
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,500
more of swatting flies especially from

1151
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,150
the executive present but thing because

1152
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,610
now it's who finds things rather than

1153
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,560
I'm trying to control and worry about

1154
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,880
something and maybe my worst-case

1155
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,070
scenario and that also really depends on

1156
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,660
how the red team pitches it and the

1157
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,660
scope of the assessment how do I take on

1158
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,900
it I guess I'm still trying to process

1159
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,910
the question so are we talking about

1160
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,220
true red teaming that's being

1161
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,570
crowd-sourced like the whole

1162
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,010
interdisciplinary or

1163
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,150
so the company or you're speaking about

1164
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,520
his company called sin app okay I

1165
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,810
personally haven't heard of it I don't

1166
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,460
know if either of you have I have any I

1167
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,290
haven't heard of that service okay so

1168
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,820
it's kind of hard to say if we don't

1169
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,870
know that much about it but what I

1170
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,070
gather so far from what you're saying

1171
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,890
it's a crowd source type activity where

1172
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,130
they have vetted penetration testers

1173
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,640
Assessors red teamers of various sorts

1174
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,270
and I don't have an hour so the

1175
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,380
companies we come to them much like a

1176
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,140
bug bounty program I imagine they say we

1177
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,210
are interested in your services and then

1178
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,190
how does the work become available and

1179
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,110
how do the Assessors say I want to work

1180
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,250
on that and how is it awarded

1181
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:48,650
right so based on what you've said so

1182
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,940
far it actually doesn't sound that

1183
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,400
different to me the only difference

1184
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,560
would be from an internal perspective if

1185
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,780
it sounds like it does a lot similar it

1186
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,790
would compete with what GDS is doing in

1187
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,590
a lot of ways for an internal red team

1188
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,900
vs cin app you don't have to dedicate

1189
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,020
resources to it on a continual basis in

1190
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,220
order to have an internal red team

1191
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,840
you've got to have people on salary on

1192
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,750
staff but to Matthews point it sounds

1193
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,980
like you lose a lot of control right

1194
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,349
like whenever when things go sideways

1195
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,480
they they have somebody then go ring the

1196
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,000
neck of ya and say you you messed

1197
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,800
something up you're in trouble now right

1198
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,960
I don't know how that would work with

1199
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,119
the company that's crowdsourcing that

1200
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,450
they would have to deal with sin app the

1201
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:32,720
company and I don't know what the but on

1202
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,010
the other side thinking about it there

1203
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,180
would be other value because now you

1204
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,890
have a collective of a larger audience

1205
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,470
of different skill sets so one other

1206
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,970
challenge is making sure if you have a

1207
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,430
small groups it has been there for so

1208
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,930
long one how do you keep a black box

1209
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,510
approach mean they've been there inside

1210
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,380
don't look at anything don't look

1211
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,970
anything don't look at that IPO now I

1212
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,369
want you to attack it right as well as

1213
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:54,920
keeping skillsets growing while most

1214
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,390
corporations they say they give training

1215
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,619
but they don't have an unlimited budget

1216
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:00,020
you now have a cross of most people who

1217
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,550
are digging and having that cross

1218
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,660
spectrum so I second season without

1219
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,030
value in there but from a large business

1220
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,890
piece it's really back to that strangle

1221
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,190
who do i strangle for liability yeah I

1222
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:12,230
don't know what like how how

1223
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,730
coordination I guess would work as well

1224
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,440
like you know internally with our team

1225
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,070
we we've internalized we know what the

1226
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,750
skill sets are of the different team and

1227
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,030
and with the tools we have available to

1228
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:26,210
us so from a crowdsource perspective I

1229
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,800
guess that would be it not so much a

1230
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,030
concern but at least a question I would

1231
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,089
have is is because there's a lot of

1232
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,830
coordination is required so how do they

1233
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,050
become aware of what's available to them

1234
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,660
oh I found this vulnerability here but I

1235
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,089
need you know some help the poppet or

1236
00:56:41,089 --> 00:56:42,290
maybe they don't even know they asked to

1237
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,780
ask the question

1238
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,180
so I guess that would be a question for

1239
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,010
me but then I'm yeah go ahead now I have

1240
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,960
a question for him so have you

1241
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,180
participated in the Senate exercises

1242
00:56:54,570 --> 00:57:03,010
else intact okay after I was ok I'm kind

1243
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,540
of curious who's in charge of the

1244
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,590
assessment like who would be the

1245
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:10,090
decision maker ultimately if it's like

1246
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,270
so there's managers here that basically

1247
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,980
get to make the decisions and then in

1248
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,320
both cases they report to a customer of

1249
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,050
some sort if you got the crowd source I

1250
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,640
mean you're logging into a website

1251
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,650
you've got instructions or some kind of

1252
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,540
work order that's coming through do this

1253
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,510
do that but whenever the tester says had

1254
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,580
I found this can I go a little further

1255
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,410
how I'm kind of curious how the

1256
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:43,500
decisions are made on the fly ok

1257
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,240
okay it sounds very similar to me it it

1258
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,740
would probably be a call savings

1259
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,440
advantage for the customer would be the

1260
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,059
big driver I would think but they lose

1261
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:15,520
the the throat to choke were there any

1262
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,260
other questions I saw some other hands I

1263
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,849
have one other one on the surface intact

1264
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:21,640
piece so would they hire someone who is

1265
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,230
more from the college level of that

1266
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,700
approach because it may be a value if

1267
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,170
they could get into that pool showing

1268
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,849
their commitments similar to the same

1269
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:29,950
thing as what we do here the more we

1270
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,740
show our skills the more kind of we get

1271
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,390
those pieces that might be an avenue of

1272
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,920
someone trying to get into the industry

1273
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,920
of red t mean that approach rather than

1274
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,020
trying to do the HR I have to have five

1275
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,180
or six years experience I can't even get

1276
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,839
past the filter

1277
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:25,839
no thank you we've got a little less

1278
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,819
than 10 minutes and I don't want to run

1279
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:29,530
over because we have another

1280
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:34,020
presentation but I saw your hand next so

1281
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,260
yeah that's actually an interesting and

1282
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,549
good question so I I did that myself my

1283
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:02,640
degree was in environmental engineering

1284
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,960
so I was out inspecting smokestacks and

1285
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,140
worked for a state government and ended

1286
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,510
up inheriting a token ring novell

1287
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,500
network so that's how I jumped into

1288
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,160
technology and then when I went to bank

1289
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,619
of america you know i think a large

1290
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:26,020
organization gave me an opportunity to

1291
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,569
get my foot in the door and technology

1292
01:00:28,569 --> 01:00:32,109
there and then have a lot of internal

1293
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:36,130
teams to become exposed to and and you

1294
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,380
know pick and choose and get hired you

1295
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,780
know internally transfer that way so i

1296
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,829
went from there to internal audit

1297
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:46,000
technology audited bank of america and

1298
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,819
so that's how i got in i don't have

1299
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:54,369
anything really i mean i I could I can

1300
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:58,569
attest to transfer from a medic 2i t is

1301
01:00:58,569 --> 01:01:00,309
how i did it basically long story short

1302
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:01,900
i went from being with marines running

1303
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,670
sick call handing out medications the

1304
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,559
doctor would leave went to Lakehurst New

1305
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:06,640
Jersey and they said all you get is a

1306
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,020
blood pressure cuff and I was bored so

1307
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,280
we had something else to do

1308
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,350
I think a big organization that has lots

1309
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,750
of internal you know a variety is one

1310
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,900
way and that's the route I took also you

1311
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,760
know it goes back to the passion living

1312
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,500
and breathing it doing it on your own in

1313
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,960
the evening so even if your current job

1314
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,890
it doesn't really give you those

1315
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,170
opportunities if you're if you're

1316
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,150
dedicated enough about it then you can

1317
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,730
get in the door that way we hire network

1318
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,500
administrators that don't have security

1319
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,690
background we have our programmers in

1320
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,100
fact I think that's good they bring a

1321
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,980
good perspective I think what you're

1322
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,780
doing now communicating that you're

1323
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,300
interested to people who are either

1324
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,860
doing it or can help you get into it

1325
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,560
that's that's key I mean I'd almost

1326
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,990
anybody that's doing this has they had

1327
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,580
to get started somehow somewhere and it

1328
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,170
usually boils down to knowing somebody

1329
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,760
and they interviewed you in some way

1330
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,110
shape or form and they were like I like

1331
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,150
you I like your skill set I want you on

1332
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,680
my team see you hand back there

1333
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,750
that is a very good question I'm going

1334
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,619
to turn that over to Keith yeah that's a

1335
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:29,820
good question so I would I would look

1336
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:34,560
into I so I would ask for an example of

1337
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,190
a report a redacted report because again

1338
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,410
it goes back to you want to see that

1339
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,990
they can understand the risks we can

1340
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,080
tailor the risk ratings to to your

1341
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,820
business into the actual scenario and

1342
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,940
we're not going to just run a scanner

1343
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,599
and take the the boilerplate out we so

1344
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,650
GDS we you know try not to get into into

1345
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:05,010
sales mode here but um we we pride

1346
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,580
ourselves in highly customized reports

1347
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,890
and weeding out false positives so I

1348
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,840
think a good place to start would be in

1349
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,030
addition addition your normal and what

1350
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,230
is your experience what is your

1351
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,510
background but get an actual example of

1352
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,790
a report and we customize our

1353
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:25,920
remediation recommendations to your

1354
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,960
technology so you know if if you're

1355
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,230
using asp we're not going to have a java

1356
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,869
recommendation you know in there or just

1357
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:36,089
a generic boilerplate recommendation so

1358
01:03:36,089 --> 01:03:38,640
that that almost assumes that the

1359
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,710
customer is educated enough to be able

1360
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,160
to make that determination and and to

1361
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,320
assess the different companies skill

1362
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,750
sets that's a incredibly good question

1363
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,160
I'm going to turn that back on the

1364
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,839
audience from a moment cuz there are

1365
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,089
other people doing this work how anybody

1366
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:55,380
willing to take a stab at answering that

1367
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,730
question the question was how does the

1368
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:00,599
customer that the services of all the

1369
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:05,930
options of vendors that can do this work

1370
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,180
yeah does that answer your question you

1371
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,819
offer services such as this don't you as

1372
01:04:48,819 --> 01:05:15,490
a vendor yeah correct you there's

1373
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,589
there's a good bit of Education involved

1374
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:19,599
even when the client comes and says hey

1375
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,030
I need your services and then trying to

1376
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:23,410
get to the bottom of exactly what they

1377
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:27,160
need is is a big part of it and it goes

1378
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,569
back to the confidence for that for that

1379
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:30,099
that customers paying the money if you

1380
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:33,099
can't explain your services to them how

1381
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:34,540
good are your services and nothing

1382
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,520
against it is a hard thing that's why I

1383
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,200
have such passionate about the color

1384
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,919
challenge

1385
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,129
but it's not

1386
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:04,779
yep yeah I think that's the point the so

1387
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:07,059
the the customer come in to you they're

1388
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:08,500
driven by compliance you mentioned that

1389
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,730
earlier they don't really know what it

1390
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:15,539
is they want or need and so right yeah

1391
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:36,369
absolutely yeah that's that's a big big

1392
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:37,930
problem and a big question how do you

1393
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,150
vet the person's skills right is that

1394
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:51,760
what you're saying so there yeah I think

1395
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,470
if you can another question you might

1396
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,500
ask is I'm not sure exactly how you

1397
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,079
would ask it but try to gauge how much

1398
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:00,640
repeat business and long-term

1399
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,349
relationship they have because if

1400
01:08:02,349 --> 01:08:04,750
they're just running basic scans and

1401
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,700
saying yes to everything that the client

1402
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,049
asks for they're probably not going to

1403
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:09,700
be around very long I mean they're

1404
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,740
they're projects that come to us that we

1405
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,630
we say you know no we're not we're not

1406
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:17,319
suited for that or we steer them in a

1407
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:18,580
different direction we because we think

1408
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:21,670
this is you know here's what you think

1409
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,870
you're asking for but really what you

1410
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,790
want is this I mean it's not to sell

1411
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:27,219
them it's to steer them in the right

1412
01:08:27,219 --> 01:08:29,710
direction and in some cases they'll ask

1413
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,448
us to engage a project and you will be

1414
01:08:31,448 --> 01:08:33,189
like you know what we can answer that in

1415
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:35,830
just an hour you know we don't even need

1416
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:38,500
to bill you for it and so that bills

1417
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,009
that long-term trusted relationship so

1418
01:08:42,009 --> 01:08:44,408
if you can get you know get some

1419
01:08:44,408 --> 01:08:46,810
referrals and try to gauge long-term

1420
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,639
relationships that's another I think we

1421
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:55,029
has an ask the question yeah let's go

1422
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:58,199
green shirt right here

1423
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:21,479
let Matthew so this is um right yeah the

1424
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:22,738
question is do you want to just give it

1425
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,149
keep giving the same reports over and

1426
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:25,649
over again and do you feel like you're

1427
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:27,359
just kind of rinsing and repeating or do

1428
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,160
you want to collectively improve its

1429
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,719
really what the crux is the red teaming

1430
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,310
is as a self going back to business

1431
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:33,870
security really we're just testing the

1432
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,219
rubber meets the road we're seeing if

1433
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:36,899
everything else is done all the

1434
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:38,399
processes all the training everything

1435
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,859
else back to why they spent all that

1436
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,649
money if we're not figuring out some way

1437
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:46,198
to learn from it it is I mean yes it's

1438
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:48,839
job security but some people are still

1439
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:51,960
learning how to change their password 20

1440
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,719
years ago chi dia rinse and repeat so I

1441
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,940
definitely see there's value in it for

1442
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,190
every single engagement no but it's

1443
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,750
going to be kind of it's a continual

1444
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,230
learning piece the balance that was

1445
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,090
always trying to keep making sure that

1446
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:08,250
you don't taint specifically we get into

1447
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,100
red teaming full going and pen testing

1448
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,590
trying to do reactions that that synergy

1449
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,380
between the red or your offensive and

1450
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,239
the defense it gets too much and they're

1451
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,620
muddling and there's collusion or

1452
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,239
there's assumptions already made which

1453
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:23,940
makes it challenging which goes back to

1454
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,620
that having an external red team gives

1455
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,230
you that whole other view and normally

1456
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,520
they'd only come in for a year and then

1457
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,260
wait three years if you're doing a full
