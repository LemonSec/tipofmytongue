1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,080
so my name is Lance Peterman just a

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,610
little bit about me you may have seen

3
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:29,779
this slide before okay cuz you're not

4
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,970
gonna get it okay I was gonna say cuz i

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,480
can talk to this i have a voice that's

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,760
not kind of small rooms so been an IT

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,489
for about 23 years now spent the large

8
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,860
part of it in and around the information

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,079
security area particularly focused for

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,840
really the last 10 on identity and

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,540
access management and I kind of relished

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,610
the fact that I'm a little bit of a odd

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,800
duck at most security cons because

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,200
identity in my experience doesn't seem

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,899
to get a lot of play at your traditional

16
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,610
security cons and you know as John

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,530
pointed out a lot of the emphasis it

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,140
b-sides and most security cons tends to

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,960
be on the offensive side which is great

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,610
I kind of like opening up because I'm

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,479
the defense so and I'm not the only

22
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,430
defense but obviously I have some

23
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,720
opinions that make me think that this

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
defense is important so in addition to

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,280
my current job at merck I'm also an

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
adjunct professor at UNC Charlotte and

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,030
the main campus I teach software

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,979
architecture and design safe harbor I of

29
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,299
course all of these opinions that i'm

30
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,979
about to share our my own some of them

31
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,600
will be war stories from either my job

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,189
or from talking to other people and you

33
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,299
can always reach out to me on twitter

34
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:46,430
linkedin I'm not hard to find because

35
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,540
there's just not that many Lance

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,580
Peterman's in the world I guess that's a

37
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,100
good thing and I will be publishing

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,240
these slides on SlideShare turn it on

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,020
okay so this was actually two days ago

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,960
which of course was Cinco de Mayo but

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,000
how many of you also know that it was

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,299
another special day and being in

43
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,840
security you should all know this it was

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,690
world password day so I'm going to

45
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,760
attempt to do this if the audio doesn't

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,989
come out right I'll kill it but we have

47
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,700
a special message from someone

48
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
I

49
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,950
you guys might have cheated and got a

50
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,480
preview of that at my Twitter feed but I

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,040
just couldn't resist I mean any light

52
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:01,210
although how do I follow that so there's

53
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,120
obviously a link to the talk with

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,710
passwords main Liam's for entertainment

55
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,900
value but credentials are a key part of

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,050
the hacking world the security kill

57
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,930
chain and so one of the pieces of this

58
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,060
and it's been my emphasis and I gave a

59
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,480
talk two years ago at this conference

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,770
kind of doing an introduction to

61
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,960
privileged access management and given

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,000
the newness of the audience I'll go over

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,370
some of those concepts again but the

64
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,530
real goal of this talk was too kind of

65
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,080
well let's be honest in two years I've

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,400
learned a lot more about privileged

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,380
access management and I'd like to share

68
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,410
some of those pieces of actual

69
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,050
implementations as opposed to you know

70
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,970
let's take a look at this vendor or

71
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,320
let's take a look at this vendor it's

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,520
going to be more of a vendor agnostic

73
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,230
talk and it's going to be more about the

74
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,690
how a privileged access management which

75
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,760
surprisingly enough doesn't necessarily

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,710
involve the technology so in doing so

77
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,510
we'll talk about what Pam is just to do

78
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,730
as a level set we'll go briefly through

79
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,790
a couple of breeches specifically tied

80
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,280
to privileged access and then we'll talk

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,500
about Pam as a program and then finally

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,410
kind of the money section of the talk

83
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,430
we'll talk about some of the keys to

84
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,740
success as part of adopting it and then

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,890
also some challenges and final thoughts

86
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,680
so what is Pam this is what it's not

87
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,670
obviously privileged access management

88
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,500
these are kind of dyed-in-the-wool

89
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,930
definitions so you know while they are a

90
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,630
little textbook II don't consider them

91
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,720
to be you know the Bible of privileged

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,460
access because as I especially as I get

93
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,350
to some of the breeches what can

94
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,880
constitute privilege may not necessarily

95
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,880
neatly fit in this definition but this

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,410
is the conventional definition of any

97
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,890
feature in any level of access to a

98
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,230
system that basically gets you that kind

99
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,150
of route administrator or higher order

100
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,300
access that can override application

101
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,050
trolls privileged accounts or identities

102
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,690
are obviously those credentials that

103
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,479
allow you to create those to leverage

104
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,930
that access and that necessarily doesn't

105
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,000
imply a human behind it could be also be

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,940
a system account or device account and

107
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,199
then the use of privileged accounts

108
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,940
should be managed and the password

109
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,590
monitored when they're stored digitally

110
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,569
and this is kind of my policy statement

111
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,490
that comes out of this and you'll hear

112
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,560
me talk about policy a lot because these

113
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,530
types of programs don't succeed in your

114
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,990
company unless there's policy behind it

115
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,180
but this is it basically in essence the

116
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,340
you know the essence of privileged

117
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,729
access management so why is privileged

118
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,520
access management important well part of

119
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,400
it is because yeah there's been this

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,530
within my field when I go to identity

121
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,430
conferences you know one of the favorite

122
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,719
sayings they have right now is that

123
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,520
identity is the new perimeter and of

124
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,930
course they want to say that because you

125
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,909
know we're passionate about digital

126
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,219
identity and it is important I kind of

127
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,300
disagree with the statement though

128
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,830
because I don't think identity is the

129
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,090
new perimeter actually think the

130
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,449
perimeter is gone the old idea that you

131
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,969
have this castle and moat mentality and

132
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,469
you can control who gets in and who

133
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,900
doesn't get in as a little bit gone by

134
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,789
the wayside is you guys have worked at

135
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,009
your various jobs or had experience with

136
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,110
other companies date is moving

137
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,300
everywhere so you have an environment

138
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,090
that's much more like this where you

139
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,789
know based on a device that has access

140
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,279
to dropbox it was in my enterprise five

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,050
minutes ago it's now out in the wild

142
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,539
five minutes later or you have a

143
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,099
software as a service that you're

144
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,199
leveraging for curricula functionality

145
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
that's sitting in a data center that you

146
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,110
have no control over the security

147
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,300
controls in that organization and that's

148
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,500
not necessarily a bad thing because

149
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,969
those guys may be on the hook for doing

150
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,469
tighter security than even you're doing

151
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,020
but the point being is that data is

152
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,180
moving everywhere now identity is

153
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,270
critical still to determining what

154
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,740
you're authorized to do with that data

155
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,620
and that's obviously what we're going to

156
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,240
talk about here but I just want to kind

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,630
of put that mythology to rest so we're

158
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,889
going to talk about a couple of breaches

159
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,779
you saw the old talk some of these may

160
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:07,710
be familiar but there's

161
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,510
relevant because I like them because

162
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,000
they talk specific to the vector within

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,570
Pam the first one is service accounts

164
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,680
you guys are probably familiar with the

165
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
breach of the department of revenue in

166
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,990
south carolina since they're our

167
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,700
neighbors about 15 minutes away from

168
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,390
here 3.4 million individual taxpayers

169
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,710
and businesses had the records

170
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,000
compromised as part of that breach and

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,980
one of the things i did love about the

172
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,220
you know nikki Haley and she's you know

173
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,409
obviously a politician so they're going

174
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,669
to try and paint this and the best terms

175
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,380
possible so they they painted it as

176
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,470
these really sophisticated hackers in

177
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,690
this really sophisticated attack when

178
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,240
probably everybody in this room knows it

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,340
really wasn't that hard given the

180
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,140
security infrastructure that they had at

181
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,480
the time I suspect anybody in this room

182
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,220
could have gotten into their network and

183
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,850
the reality was and this is again why I

184
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,410
call out the definition of privileged

185
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,230
access this was not a high level you

186
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,940
know system admin account that was

187
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,060
compromised it's a backup account and a

188
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,290
lot of people don't think of backup

189
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,270
accounts as being necessarily privileged

190
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,280
identities but the reality was because

191
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,620
this account was responsible for backing

192
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,170
up the taxpayer database which happened

193
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,440
to not be encrypted they were able to

194
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,900
exfiltrate that data so that's one

195
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,390
aspect of this the other one that a lot

196
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,400
of people won't look at with respect to

197
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,780
privileged access management it's

198
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,290
probably the most critical one is local

199
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,300
admin accounts whether it is the user

200
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,190
themselves who has local i I've been

201
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,620
access to their workstation or just the

202
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,210
administrator account that the user may

203
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,890
not necessarily have access to in the

204
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,260
case of the Saudi Aramco breach this was

205
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,060
an insider attack where somebody got a

206
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,430
little disgruntled but because this

207
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,680
company in making fun of Saudi Aramco

208
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,270
but a lot of companies unfortunately do

209
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,520
this they had the same password or

210
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,000
similar passwords for all of their local

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,380
admin accounts on all of their

212
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,230
workstations and so this guy knew what

213
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,110
that one password was and was able to

214
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,770
erase just running a simple script erase

215
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,890
30,000 hard drives now the good news was

216
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,200
Saudi Aramco actually had some decent

217
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,140
SEC ops from a backup perspective and

218
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,970
they were able to get back up and

219
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,770
running

220
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,600
relatively quickly you know but to say

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
that this was a disruptive attack would

222
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,480
be an understatement and they did lose

223
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,830
some data out of this in spite of the

224
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,130
backups so in looking at that you know

225
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,050
how does your organization manage those

226
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,800
credentials does your primary user do

227
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,480
you have admin access to your

228
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,980
workstation and of course everybody here

229
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,480
says yes because I'm not going to get

230
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,200
caught by one of those attacks right I'd

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
love to say I'm one of those people but

232
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,310
I got hit by ransomware about two years

233
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,740
ago I still to this day have no idea

234
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,180
what I clicked that created the

235
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,330
ransomware attack so probably something

236
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,840
that got past my bad blocker but so it

237
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,390
happens so one of the things you can

238
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,650
talk about and I'll talk to this later

239
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,460
with respect to the best practices is if

240
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,580
you can get users to give up their local

241
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,710
admin privileges obviously giving them

242
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,980
access to those privileges and an

243
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,840
alternative fashion you can stop a lot

244
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,700
of attacks I was talking with Dave

245
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,020
Kennedy who was keynoting in a

246
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,850
conference that i was at two days ago

247
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,060
and i just asked him point-blank I said

248
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,970
if we revoked admin access to all of

249
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,670
these users a lot of your attacks get

250
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,580
harder don't they and he said absolutely

251
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,800
so that's one of the things to consider

252
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,550
and then of course briefly ebay typical

253
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,050
spear phishing attack one of their key

254
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,050
IT people got hit so it even happens to

255
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,060
the IT folks their security aware too

256
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,710
but they're not security perfect nobody

257
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,100
is really and one of the things that I

258
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,980
call out here is your primary account

259
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,930
and by that I mean the same account that

260
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,660
you use to send emails does that have

261
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,430
elevated access to other systems in your

262
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,100
company it's a good chance the answer to

263
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,290
that is yes depending upon your job role

264
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,440
and it's a matter of convenience but one

265
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,490
of the things you may want to consider

266
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,500
is segregating that access whether you

267
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,390
create one admin account that you can

268
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,330
use against multiple systems or the real

269
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,770
pain in the butt approaches you create

270
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,170
multiple admin accounts but the

271
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,910
important thing is you separate that

272
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,010
access if I click on an email that has

273
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,310
malware attachment in it if I've lost my

274
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,170
admin access they can't execute what

275
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,640
they need to do to implement the malware

276
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,100
most likely not

277
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,500
teed and more importantly they can't do

278
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,970
anything with the credential they just

279
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,410
stole and then finally this is one of my

280
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,589
favorite examples default passwords is

281
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:49,639
the bane of any enterprises existence in

282
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,029
this particular scenario the two

283
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,899
Canadian teenagers found an old ATM

284
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:02,180
manual and discovered that all of the

285
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,610
ATMs built with this have a default

286
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,430
password well guess what they did they

287
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,110
went and found somewhere that had this

288
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,699
older version of the ATM and admittedly

289
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,920
it was a very old ATM relative to the

290
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,029
standards that are out there today but

291
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,649
they managed to find one and guess what

292
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,050
still had the default password on it so

293
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,370
needless to say they were able to do a

294
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,589
little damage with that so what does

295
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,750
that tell us obviously the threat

296
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,459
landscape is changing daily but a lot of

297
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,029
the patterns are kind of the same

298
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:30,529
compromised and privileged access is the

299
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,209
key stage in one hundred percent of all

300
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,759
advanced text now I'm not saying all of

301
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,709
them involve privileged credentials

302
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:37,699
because I think that would be a kind of

303
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,079
a biased viewpoint but all of them

304
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,420
include privileged elevation how you

305
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,100
achieve that may involve credentials

306
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,139
that's the easier target or you may be

307
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,550
using exploits and things at that but

308
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,810
that's obviously not the focus of this

309
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,660
talk this is the critical attack vector

310
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,779
for internal and external threats recent

311
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,610
report from psychotic said forty five

312
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,199
percent of hackers directly target

313
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,019
privileged credentials now I think they

314
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,550
said thirty-three percent are going

315
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,329
after the basic user credentials now you

316
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:06,769
guys are probably all familiar with the

317
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,630
verizon data breach investigator report

318
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,459
ninety-seven percent of all breaches are

319
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,689
preventable through basic and

320
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,939
intermediate controls this is obviously

321
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,990
just one of them in 2012 forty-three

322
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,899
percent of respondents to a survey said

323
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,120
they either didn't have a pam practice

324
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,709
of any kind or they weren't sure if they

325
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,660
did and if they aren't sure if they did

326
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,310
one of two things is true either a they

327
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,899
don't or b it's not a very good one so

328
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,009
we're going to go briefly through the

329
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,209
practice of privileged access management

330
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,560
it's basically designed to answer some

331
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,630
very basic questions who or what has

332
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,459
that level of privileged access when was

333
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,260
it used where was it used from because

334
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,070
if you're in an organization

335
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,870
where you may outsource or manage

336
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,790
service some of your access that's

337
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,740
especially important to understand what

338
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,900
youre managed providers are doing on

339
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,150
your network because you not only have

340
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,530
the potential for insider attacks from

341
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,660
the here but they could be naughty as

342
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,420
well and sometimes it's not even a

343
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,100
question of being naughty you look at

344
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,720
the target breach it was the third party

345
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,210
vendor who got compromised and that's

346
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,040
how they were able to get in so you

347
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
could put in the best controls over your

348
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,310
individual users and create you know a

349
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,800
magical security awareness program you

350
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,270
can't control the guys that are part of

351
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,440
your third party vendor and one thing I

352
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,480
do emphasize and you may hear this a

353
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,310
couple more times technology is only one

354
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,800
part of the equation people in process

355
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,170
and my previous talks actually started

356
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,110
off with a horse story because I one of

357
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,030
my passions in life is working with my

358
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,240
horses and one of my horses got out

359
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,770
because I didn't close the gate problem

360
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,500
and had all the great controls in the

361
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,060
world but if you don't close that gate

362
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,070
and make sure that it's stuck horse gets

363
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,520
out so and then finally this has to be a

364
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,500
part of your governance process if you

365
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,000
don't know what your governance process

366
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,470
is at your company that's where you

367
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,940
start but one of the things that frankly

368
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,460
I have some scars from even though I

369
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,220
preach this from the outset when you're

370
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,780
working with the business on this this

371
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,000
cannot be considered kind of a one-off

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,130
enrollment like okay you guys are

373
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,140
knocking out my door i understand i need

374
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,360
to get compliant what do I get it to

375
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,780
make you go away and the answer is a yes

376
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,580
we want to enroll you in our privileged

377
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,160
access management program but be you

378
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,840
have to continually demonstrate

379
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,000
compliance and we demonstrating

380
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,010
compliance includes monitoring how

381
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,780
you're privileged accounts are managed

382
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,070
and what's done with them this slide I

383
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,570
won't go into a whole lot of detail on

384
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,130
but one of the things that I want to

385
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,140
call out is a lot of the larger

386
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,330
companies have some relatively

387
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,690
sophisticated IT Enterprise models

388
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,770
whether it is ITIL sdlc DevOps or itsm

389
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,990
one of the critical ways to gain success

390
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,090
in privileged access management is to

391
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,090
get integrated with those programs what

392
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,430
we do at Merck is when we're on boarding

393
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,350
new application they go through that

394
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,750
process of onboarding and then for those

395
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,400
applications that may not necessarily be

396
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,959
on boarded yet when they come to the

397
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,819
change review board and they say hey I

398
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,709
need to schedule an outage for next

399
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,420
weekend first question we ask them is

400
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,520
have your privileged accounts been

401
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,970
enrolled and if the answer is no we may

402
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,869
not tell them you know if they're

403
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,130
looking for an outage next week and we

404
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,359
may not tell me what you can't do that

405
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,640
then but that's our way of getting

406
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,920
engaged with those guys to say you need

407
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,540
to get those accounts on boarded so that

408
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,800
we can manage other being accessed the

409
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,730
other thing that I'll call out here is

410
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,660
one of the toughest things about

411
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,940
privileged access management is you can

412
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,500
install a firewall on the users don't

413
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,440
blink unless of course you block port 80

414
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,970
and 443 but generally a lot of security

415
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,380
practices are designed to be

416
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,470
frictionless to the user to be

417
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,360
successful Pam is not one of those

418
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,730
experiences we're going to make the

419
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,559
lives of the people that operate these

420
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,690
privileged accounts at least a little

421
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,929
bit harder but what you have to sell

422
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,850
them on and hopefully this talk will

423
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,850
help feed this a little bit is the why

424
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,540
of that and so that's why those business

425
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,309
relationships are so critical and it's

426
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,270
not just for privileged access

427
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,070
management it's for security in general

428
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,559
if you can have partnerships with your

429
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,070
business customers and constantly

430
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,510
communicate with them but when you're

431
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,160
getting ready to do a project you can

432
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
help explain them the why of it

433
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,360
successfully more often than not you're

434
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,890
not going to get as much friction and

435
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,600
enabling that and I'm not going to say

436
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,250
that that's a perfect story because I

437
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,620
still get a lot of friction with it but

438
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,730
we've also had a lot more success

439
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,110
because of it so that's one of the

440
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,150
things you know educate and engage your

441
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,200
business owners whenever possible so

442
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,630
briefly this is more for future

443
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,460
reference I am going to be making these

444
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,970
slides available on SlideShare but this

445
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,350
is my attempt at a Pam reference

446
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,880
architecture and obviously it starts

447
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,130
with the pam piece so you have your

448
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,750
password vault you have session

449
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,910
management recording Pam policy

450
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,809
management because are going to have

451
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,010
policies surrounding some of those

452
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,440
accounts you may have a segregation of

453
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,400
duty policy depending upon

454
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,290
you know what type of systems you may be

455
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,990
enabling you're going to have discovery

456
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,490
and policy enforcement discovery is

457
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,740
great sometimes because you can actually

458
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,420
discover when new accounts come up in

459
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,190
your business and you can automatically

460
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,620
enroll them into your Pam product for

461
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,750
most products and then in addition to

462
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,160
assessing management and recording and

463
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,480
I'll talk to the use case in a second

464
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,910
have some function set up to do session

465
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,430
review because doesn't you know if you

466
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,410
record it but you never look at it what

467
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,260
was the point of recording it and then

468
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,340
of course you're going to overlay that

469
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,840
or integrate that with your identity and

470
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,490
access management layer that includes

471
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,100
your core user identities but it also in

472
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,310
core includes your non-person

473
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,200
credentials and I separate this out

474
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,060
ordinarily this would be considered part

475
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,820
of your identity management program but

476
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,440
I wanted to call this out because these

477
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,730
are their system accounts that are on

478
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,960
all these devices that are out there

479
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,110
that typically have a lot higher access

480
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,820
than your average user account will but

481
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,050
you also want to account for what those

482
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,630
accounts are capable of doing and then

483
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,500
finally you won't have access

484
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,050
certification if I have root access or

485
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,380
high level system access to a database

486
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,010
at least within a year my manager should

487
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,750
it be able to attest that yes Lance

488
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,330
still needs access to that system so

489
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,160
having that access certification process

490
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,600
and that may not necessarily be

491
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,580
intrinsic to the Pam tooling that you're

492
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,960
buying so you're going to have to work

493
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,460
with your identity management group to

494
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,630
hopefully create that access

495
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,220
certification that's a critical piece of

496
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,680
this process and then you achieve that

497
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,870
by integrating that with your various IT

498
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,230
resources your policy store your SRM our

499
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,030
ticketing whether it's remedy service

500
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,360
now or whatever workflow could be

501
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,160
outside of your product some of the

502
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,570
products also support their own workflow

503
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,970
functions you need logging and audit

504
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,400
obviously and then ideally you should

505
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,890
integrate this with your cmdb and change

506
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,690
management process that's really where

507
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,340
you get the teeth behind this program

508
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,500
and then finally there's some

509
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,600
encouraging work taking place in this

510
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,330
area it's already taking place and

511
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,970
relatively mature in the saem space but

512
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,290
in the analytic space it's even more

513
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,730
interesting and I'll get to that in just

514
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,040
a minute but trying to create identity

515
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,870
or what we call user behavior analytics

516
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,290
out of this is an interesting potential

517
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,070
so now we're going to talk through a

518
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,040
couple of use cases

519
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,020
these are the big use cases and the top

520
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,880
one is what you would call your your

521
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,450
classic vaulting scenario where the user

522
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,100
is going to go to your privileged access

523
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,360
management tool they're going to check

524
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,680
out the password and they're going to go

525
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,380
to the system paste in that password and

526
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,330
then after they check the password back

527
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,740
in ideally you would change that

528
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,480
password that's the ideal pattern when

529
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,000
you have to vault the more ideal

530
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,590
scenario is what we call the session

531
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,750
management scenario where the user

532
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,880
ideally doesn't even have awareness of

533
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,220
what the privileged password is or the

534
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,330
credential for that matter although

535
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,740
obviously they may be able to figure

536
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,960
some of it out but the same scenario

537
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,100
they're going to go to the privileged

538
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,140
access tool they're going to check that

539
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,570
credential out but instead of going to

540
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,160
whatever tool they're going to use you

541
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,530
instantiate the tool from within the Pam

542
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,520
tool and whether it's you know doing SSH

543
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,620
to a linux server or whether it's you

544
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,770
know remote desktop to windows server

545
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,210
that session instantiates from within

546
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,770
the Pam tool what that allows you to do

547
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,500
is record what takes place and that's

548
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,180
where you get some real bang from the

549
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,010
buck but that's also where you get the

550
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,620
most secure solution because a the

551
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,720
administrator doesn't know or whoever

552
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,610
the user is doesn't know the credentials

553
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,560
being used particularly the password and

554
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,200
be from a change management perspective

555
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,670
and this is where you sell it to your

556
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,710
change management board they can go back

557
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,180
through the recordings and figure out

558
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,680
what took place in a particular session

559
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,360
so that when you do have an incident

560
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,910
even if it's not a security incident

561
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,170
they may be able to figure out what took

562
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,360
place and so this could be a real asset

563
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,490
in their arsenal other use cases you can

564
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,950
most of the Pam tools nowadays can use

565
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,980
api's to manage script and patch

566
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,750
management so instead of storing the

567
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,460
credentials in those scripts you know

568
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,990
how many of us work at companies that do

569
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,060
that today unfortunately way too many

570
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,000
and those are typically higher level

571
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,560
credentials to because they have to have

572
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,350
the ability to manipulate data I've

573
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,620
already talked about local workstations

574
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,150
other use cases involve cloud

575
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,770
infrastructure and SAS accounts are

576
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,650
working with your amazon accounts also

577
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,410
any sass products that are out there

578
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,670
oftentimes you can use api's to change

579
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,210
those virtualization platforms don't

580
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,340
forget your VMware infrastructure

581
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,289
you know the route accounts on those

582
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,690
systems have a lot of power to them and

583
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,940
I'll give you a little bit of a joke

584
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,130
about that in a minute and more most

585
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,750
importantly look at all of your hardware

586
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,520
platforms including the industrial

587
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,529
systems not don't just think of it in

588
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,750
terms of the client-server hierarchy

589
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,460
look at your networking devices look at

590
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,529
your skata systems even in some

591
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:01,970
instances this is still kind of growing

592
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,260
look at your internet of things the

593
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,490
devices that are coming into your

594
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,190
enterprise where's your risk at that's

595
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,830
ultimately what's going to drive this

596
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,730
and I'm gonna skip through the adoption

597
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,870
approach here because I know we're

598
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,840
running a little short on time the one

599
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,850
thing I will say with respect to the

600
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,270
adoption approach verify that they're

601
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,070
using your privileged access management

602
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,380
tool and I say this somewhat jokingly

603
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,380
because should be obvious right but one

604
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,960
of the things we had early on when we

605
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,399
had a managed service provider that was

606
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,240
helping onboard our customers and

607
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,929
occasionally they would get friction

608
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:38,149
about the onboarding not the fact that

609
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,520
we created an entry for this account but

610
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,559
part of that process for obvious reasons

611
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,299
has to involve changing that password

612
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,059
and then we go oh wait a minute we've

613
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,470
got an outage coming up in three weeks

614
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,390
we really can't afford to change it

615
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,620
right now so if you can just give us a

616
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,360
little bit of time we'll get it changed

617
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,740
and you know what we'll take care of

618
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,059
them more like okay okay we don't want

619
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,380
to you know disrupt you guys too much

620
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,140
five months later they still aren't

621
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,250
using the product so this is where you

622
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,830
run into challenges because pan isn't

623
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,809
just about compliance ultimately it's

624
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,360
about security as my friend Fernando

625
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,649
would say and I'm not going to attempt

626
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:16,190
to do his voice so what are some key to

627
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,039
success here the first is fault

628
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,750
tolerance obviously if you're storing

629
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,460
all your privileged identities in one

630
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,679
place it has to be fault tolerant that

631
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:26,690
kind of goes without saying if you're a

632
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,220
global companies should be architect or

633
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,840
even if you're not if it's just a United

634
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,130
States company you should architect for

635
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,779
performance and geography so you're west

636
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,039
coast and your East Coast should have

637
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,559
the same type of latency or if your

638
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,419
global same rules apply but probably

639
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:42,559
even more so support for this must have

640
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,110
senior leadership adoption I can't

641
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,179
stress that enough this is one of those

642
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,799
programs that cannot start from the

643
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,390
ground up and you walk around and go hey

644
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,770
guys I got this really cool tool will

645
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,389
help you manage privileged identities

646
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:55,899
you're going to get the yeah whatever

647
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,759
it's just not something that they want

648
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,909
to focus on focus on the process first

649
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:03,799
then the tooling I've already talked

650
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,209
about consider integrating it with your

651
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:08,899
cmdb if you're cmdb is up to date that

652
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,789
can often be a challenge in some bigger

653
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:13,579
companies it was for us we invested a

654
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,259
major effort for the last two years in

655
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,789
cleaning up our cmdb and it's a lot more

656
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:19,309
useful to us now be creative with this

657
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,919
one size does not fit all so when you go

658
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,450
back to that reference architecture

659
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,009
don't feel like you have to adopt all of

660
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,959
those processes even if you're just

661
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,190
starting out with a privilege of a

662
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,009
password vault that could be moving you

663
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,419
light years ahead from a security

664
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,809
perspective when you're selecting a

665
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,879
vendor consider cloud implications can

666
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,739
they talk to your various cloud vendors

667
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,239
that you work with your SAS providers

668
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,649
can you change passwords at that level

669
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:45,200
if not you may stay with that vendor but

670
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,609
you might consider an alternative vendor

671
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:50,119
to support that piece don't virtualize

672
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:58,489
your vault the why here's why now in

673
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:00,769
defense of cyber Ark which is one of the

674
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:03,079
major Pam vendors out there and a very

675
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,789
good vendor I will also act because

676
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,099
Kevin also said several tweets later

677
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,989
they he still considers them one of the

678
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:11,179
top vendors in the market the reason

679
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,499
they were complaining about it wasn't

680
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,029
the tool itself it was how it was

681
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:16,969
implemented it was configured using ESX

682
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,609
so the vault itself was running as a

683
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,649
virtual machine on a server that was

684
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:24,440
shared with 50 other hosts and that was

685
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,509
a vector for attack and not surprisingly

686
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,299
he went after it eat your own dog food

687
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,909
first that kind of makes standard since

688
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:33,919
I would hope get used to the Pam tooling

689
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,179
yourself start securing your own

690
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:36,709
accounts with it you're going to get

691
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,089
experience with the tooling that way you

692
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,499
can share it with your customer base and

693
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:40,849
then finally don't think you're too

694
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:42,829
small for this even if you can't afford

695
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,629
to negotiate with a company like a cyber

696
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,589
Ark or quest or Lieberman or who ever

697
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:50,359
think about getting a vault you know you

698
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,099
can even there's some open source vaults

699
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,509
out there that can get you guys started

700
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,639
but just because you're a 50-person

701
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,889
company a doesn't mean you don't have

702
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,589
privileged accounts you do and B doesn't

703
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:01,519
mean you shouldn't be trying to do

704
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,269
something to protect them

705
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:07,539
so final thoughts here clash with teams

706
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,129
on tooling and process is going to be

707
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:11,440
common database administrators in

708
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,909
particular but this can be true of any

709
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,789
IT organization they have certain tools

710
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:17,619
that they want to use to access their

711
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:20,619
databases with and sometimes your Pam

712
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,330
tooling may not necessarily support them

713
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,009
so you've got to work out a compromise

714
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:27,669
on that make sure you're monitoring for

715
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:30,190
out of band accounts particularly with

716
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,899
domain administrators if you have a

717
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:33,369
domain administrator guess what you can

718
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:36,479
also create other domain administrators

719
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,950
so you want to be monitoring for that

720
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,419
and the good news is most of the Pam

721
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,099
tools out there today will monitor the

722
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,809
creation of new accounts so you can

723
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,809
automatic you could either sandbox those

724
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,789
accounts or you could auto enroll them

725
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:51,969
into the pam tool make sure your

726
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:53,349
priorities or where they're supposed to

727
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:54,909
be if you're not if you're partnering

728
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:56,139
with the business but they're like you

729
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,089
know what I've got a day job and you

730
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,159
know which is true just about everybody

731
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,079
you know they're going to say hey I

732
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,599
really don't have time for this if their

733
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,950
boss is calling on the phone and says oh

734
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,259
by the way you have time for this that's

735
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:09,940
how you get success on this and you hate

736
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,369
to use that stick approach ideally you

737
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:14,320
want to start with the carrot and

738
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,700
sometimes you can if you sell them on

739
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,989
the priority for it sometimes that

740
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,369
happens sometimes you do have to bring

741
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,529
the stick one way of doing that

742
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,359
sometimes for certain professionals is

743
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,469
making a KPI tie into their bonus

744
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:27,609
they'll guarantee you he didn't forget

745
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,499
about us that'll guarantee their

746
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:31,599
attention the cloud can mess this all up

747
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,919
except for it doesn't like I said

748
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,700
there's kind of a transition time in

749
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,499
getting some of the cloud vendors on

750
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:40,029
board with this it's getting a lot

751
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,669
better taking a look at API is one of

752
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:43,869
the key challenges when you are looking

753
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,029
at an API strategy if that happens to be

754
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,639
part of your focus is your win is access

755
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:50,829
of an API privileged access when does it

756
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:51,969
rise to that level and you're going to

757
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:54,039
manage that based on risk and then

758
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,509
finally with the respect to the role of

759
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,269
analytics this is kind of a burgeoning

760
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,969
area it's still a little immature in the

761
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:03,159
identity space so when you look at user

762
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:04,629
behavior analytics you're going to look

763
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:07,089
at it a much more from a more

764
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:09,309
conventional security context you but

765
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,099
you can still monitor using those

766
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,259
analytics tools what you're privileged

767
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:15,820
identities are and when things are

768
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,290
happening that are out of the norm

769
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,780
with those privileged identities you can

770
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,130
use analytics and some of your

771
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,870
orchestration tools to maybe manage

772
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,460
what's happening with those so if

773
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,710
there's an application that is doing

774
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,040
things that it ordinarily doesn't do

775
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,330
maybe you disable that service account

776
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,920
or delete that service account and

777
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,450
insert a new service account immediately

778
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,580
after that hopefully minimizing

779
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,810
disruption but it might be a way of

780
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,320
throwing an attack and with that any

781
00:30:41,320 --> 00:31:00,130
questions probably the easiest metric I

782
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,290
look at is understanding who's actually

783
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,470
using the tool you know so how are you

784
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,000
you all boarded this account two weeks

785
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,160
ago has that administrator logged into

786
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,020
this tool now sometimes some of these

787
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,690
accounts are arcane so they may only go

788
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,150
in once a quarter to use this council

789
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,800
obviously you have to have some context

790
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,940
for that but you can look at your

791
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,860
adoption rate from that and the other

792
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,900
metric and it's a little bit dumber

793
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,520
metric but unfortunately some senior

794
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,250
execs may buy into this one is you know

795
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,960
how many accounts you have what

796
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,780
percentage of them have been on boarded

797
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,520
if you're successful in getting in them

798
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,200
properly adopting the tool that becomes

799
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,730
a much more effective metric but it's

800
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,720
the one will probably pay the most

801
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,170
attention to any other questions

802
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:56,230
huh well I was strictly talking with

803
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,620
respect to the password vaulting I to be

804
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,360
honest there may be some open source

805
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,820
tools out there I am and I'm not

806
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:12,340
personally aware of them yes sir it's

807
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,100
not necessarily issuing passwords for

808
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,270
services and that type of thing but a

809
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,120
lot of the services now gets more into

810
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,190
like providing privileges to like

811
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,320
systems or other things so that the

812
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,580
design of it is a little bit different

813
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,049
to eliminate passwords and things like

814
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:30,490
that or integrating into those

815
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,770
environments what yeah I mean there are

816
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,030
some issues with it I think it's a great

817
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,640
question because that's you know it kind

818
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,679
of comes from two vectors one is those

819
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,299
type of accounts are the most dangerous

820
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:46,450
ones from that perspective because they

821
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,799
can do a lot of damage that they're

822
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,110
compromised but by the same token the

823
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,610
more that you can get away from the

824
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,880
password model now admittedly from a

825
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,620
security perspective sometimes that can

826
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,870
open up new vectors to attack like pass

827
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,780
the hash things of that nature but if

828
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,990
you can get to a password list solution

829
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,330
that you know all the better you're

830
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,159
obviously looking at hopefully some more

831
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:10,780
sophisticated ways of authenticating

832
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,000
those accounts so they can execute those

833
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,460
functions the vendors today aren't as

834
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,980
caught up with that yet because in spite

835
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,110
of identity vendors telling you how much

836
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,000
they're going to kill the password they

837
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,520
haven't quite achieved that yet and

838
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,659
frankly I don't think they're going to

839
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:28,900
anytime soon but we are getting some

840
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,990
good inroads into coming up with

841
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,760
alternative authentication mechanisms

842
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,230
that I think will blow up support that

843
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,380
in the future because somebody back here

844
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,070
yes sir

845
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,620
ships I have not

846
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:04,340
oh okay cool oh yes sir I always try and

847
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,550
avoid this here's what i will say that

848
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,170
there are a lot of great vendors out

849
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,880
that space and i will list some of them

850
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,830
but this list is by no means all

851
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,350
inclusive lieberman software makes a

852
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,659
really good product cyber Ark obviously

853
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,920
you know there was a joke at their

854
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,510
expense here but they also make a very

855
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,560
good product it used to be quest now

856
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,050
it's dell dell has a TDM product that's

857
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,860
pretty solid there are a couple of

858
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,290
cloud-based vendors and one of them just

859
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,969
shot right out of my head I can't

860
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,530
remember they those are some of the big

861
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,610
ones are out there I know some of the

862
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,870
other vendors a lot of people are trying

863
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,150
to get in this space Oracle has been

864
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,380
trying to get in the space and I'm not

865
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,500
necessarily going to advocate for them

866
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,030
but you know they're there are

867
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,679
recognizing if you guys are a huge

868
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,449
Oracle shop they might be worth taking a

869
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,560
look at because they might have some

870
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,270
unique advantages working within your

871
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,400
Oracle product suite to manage that

872
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,380
privileged access but a lot of the other

873
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,300
vendors will will give you assistance in

874
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,560
that space as well but those are some of

875
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,460
the big ones hope that helps anybody

876
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,950
else yes sir

877
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,750
I appreciate you mentioning Centrify

878
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,740
because that was the one that shot right

879
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,380
out of my head I could not remember

880
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,809
their name Centrify is definitely in

881
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:30,349
this space their value proposition is

882
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:31,990
managing a lot of the cloud-based

883
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,849
privileged identities they are trying to

884
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,010
focus a little bit more on you know your

885
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,390
enterprise infrastructure privileged

886
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,880
access as well so they're definitely a

887
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,869
vendor in that space and they're very

888
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:44,029
similar I mean similar vaulting and

889
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,349
session management things of that nature

890
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,859
anybody else well thank you guys very

891
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,299
much for your attention and your

892
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:55,869
questions
