1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,960

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,679

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
i started an llc from my bed and so can

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,160
you

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,640
um it's kind of a funny story so i'll

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
just give you some background but

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
before we dive in i just want to let you

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
know the very typical

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
um covering my behind

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
so i'm not a lawyer i'm not an

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,679
accountant i'm not

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,600
an insurance or a financial person or hr

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
um so none of this presentation or if we

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,040
talk afterwards please don't take it as

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,239
legal or professional advice and

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,039
i just also want to caveat that this

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,120
presentation and my process

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
you know it's not a perfect thing i

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
learned a lot of lessons along the way

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
and also you know i'm extremely blessed

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
in a lot of different ways and we're all

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,359
different

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
and so your journey through this should

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
you decide to try

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,720
uh will probably be different and that's

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
good and that's okay

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
um and then just very you know last

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
thing feel free to dm me anytime

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
hey ellie hansen on twitter so with all

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:15,920
of the

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
formalities out of the way let's get

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
started

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
so um first things first

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
i started an llc for my bed it might

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
sound kind of like

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
um an interesting title and

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,119
it's actually true so let's see

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,840
i can't believe it's still 2020. somehow

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,799
it is

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
and in the beginning of the year

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
um i was kind of so

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
burnt out from my work and

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,240
i was really um you know i was always a

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,720
high achiever and i found myself a

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
really low point

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,920
um just in general in my life and

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
you know i was burnt out mentally

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
physically emotionally

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,640
which is really um really a difficult

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
thing and i had never really reached

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,599
that level of burnout before and i hope

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,400
you know i hope that

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,120
none of you listening um get to that

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
point because it's it's truly

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
devastating

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
and um you know i was just drained

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
and disintegrated really to my core

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
and um so you know it was like there was

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
nights i went to sleep

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
and i really was so exhausted that i was

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,840
not

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,560
100 confident that i would even wake up

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
from that sleep

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
it was a really scary time in my life

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,680
and i would wake up in the morning

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
you know luckily and i would just be so

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
angry and so frustrated like as soon as

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
i opened my eyes and i knew that

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
something had to change and that that

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
was just not a healthy way

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
to be living my life um and so

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,640
basically um you know the the title of

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
this talk

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
i started an llc from my bed and so can

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,280
you

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
it's it's actually true right so i

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
stayed um

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
for about two weeks straight i kind of

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
just stayed in bed

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
and then uh slept and recovered and then

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
slowly but surely

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
i started to think about my next moves

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,599
and i started to think about

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,560
um you know what steps i needed to take

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
to get there

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
and sometimes it was just really sending

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,080
like one

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
email a day or researching one topic

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
a day and i would consider that a

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
success for that day

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
and so i took it very slow and steady

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,360
and i guess that's

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
you know one of the reasons in addition

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,640
to

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,239
um so you'll see there's like a little

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,760
cell phone icon

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
on the screen and i did most of this for

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,280
like

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
basically seven or six or seven weeks

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
all of this planning and

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
creation i literally did it on my cell

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
phone

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
and uh my cell phone was actually

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,319
cracked so

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,120
pretty much the worst type of uh

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
situations you can think of for like

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
trying to start a company

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
um so that's why i say you know if i can

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
do it i think you guys can too

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,639
so um a little bit of background

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
on how that all came to be so i guess

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
the first thing

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
uh that you would want to think about is

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
what do you want to do

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
right it's kind of obvious but you need

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,000
to think about

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
um you know what what business or what

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,240
you want to do or what service or

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
product

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
right and you probably you know you

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,639
might have an inclination of that

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
already

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,759
like depending upon your background and

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
your experience and what you want to do

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
um for me i already kind of knew what i

129
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
wanted to do

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,800
and that was to provide us consulting

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
service

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
and so i kind of already knew what i was

133
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
gonna do it wasn't like

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
i had to you know create a tool or

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,039
um you know make an actual physical

136
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,120
invention or anything like that right so

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
for me that was kind of easy

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,000
um and i'd be you know very happy to

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
talk with you guys about

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,160
sort of the creation of your idea and

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
what you want to do

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
if that's something that you need help

143
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
with

144
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
so for me i already kind of knew and i

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
had done a lot of

146
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,240
informal research sort of in formulating

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
what i was gonna do

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,400
you know with whom to whom everything um

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,840
and again you know we could talk about

150
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,080
that ad nauseam in terms of like

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,479
you know sort of market research and

152
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
things like that if you needed to

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,199
but for me i kind of knew i had a good

154
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,720
idea of what i was going to do was

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
pretty needed

156
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,320
so um so after you kind of figure out

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
what you want to do

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,720
there's a few things for me that i had

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,280
to

160
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
really consider and go through so

161
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
the first thing um is money

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,199
the second thing is timing

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
and the third thing was like contracts

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
and legal considerations

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
and your situation might be very

166
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
different and again this is just

167
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,919
you know my story and my journey um so

168
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,600
these are the three main things that

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,240
you know before i really got started i

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
decided i need to

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
figure out these three areas so

172
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
the first thing how am i gonna get money

173
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,120
to

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
you know just give myself a little

175
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,639
cushion to live on

176
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,600
and to pay whatever these expenses are

177
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,039
that are gonna come up because i didn't

178
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,240
even know

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
and you know there was really nothing

180
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,600
online

181
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,080
you know on any of those entrepreneur

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
websites or business websites like

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
nothing was actually really helpful and

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
that's why i'm hoping this is going to

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
help you all

186
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
and um in a way that maybe you can't

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,039
find online

188
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
just the real answers or a real

189
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,599
checklist or real considerations

190
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,400
so um that's my hope here so anyway so i

191
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
was like thinking okay how am i gonna

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
get money

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,080
and i decided personally that i was

194
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,199
going to withdraw

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
some money from i have a few 401k

196
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
accounts so i was gonna

197
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
look at the one and i kind of took a

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
survey of all the accounts that i had

199
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
you know previous jobs and i was looking

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
at um the performance of each different

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
account

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,639
because some were performing a lot

203
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
better maybe i didn't want to touch

204
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,599
those let those grow

205
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,080
more um and obviously different amounts

206
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,039
in each one

207
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,680
different penalty rules just kind of

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
different things like that like also

209
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,240
maybe

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
certain accounts were charged a certain

211
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,080
annual fee

212
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
others were not right so there's you

213
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,280
know kind of some

214
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
research that you can look into all of

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,639
your different accounts for your

216
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,639
401k if that's what you decide to do and

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
luckily enough i was able to do that

218
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
um and so basically just you know so you

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,280
know

220
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,720
um there is a 10 federal fee so that

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,319
goes to the federal government

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
for withdrawing pretty much any amount

223
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960
um if you're under the age of like 59

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,520
and a half

225
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,280
which i am so i knew i had to pay a 10

226
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,599
fee on that amount that i was going to

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,720
withdraw

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
in addition you will have to likely pay

229
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,319
whatever your particular state fee is

230
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,319
um so you have the federal level fee and

231
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
also a state level fee

232
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,319
and usually that's less um but you'll

233
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,879
have to check with your exact state

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
and then um you will also have to be

235
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,479
paying

236
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,760
um basically like your taxes

237
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,799
on that income that you withdraw from

238
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
your 401k account

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
so whatever your tax bracket happens to

240
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
be

241
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
you kind of attack that on so there's a

242
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
lot there's a lot of fees that add up

243
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
um if you go with this route and you

244
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,680
know it wasn't necessarily

245
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
maybe the best route or you know the

246
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
least fee

247
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
amount um you know method obviously

248
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
but it's what worked for me it's what i

249
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
had and um so here's a quick example you

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
know just really high level right so

251
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
let's say you have

252
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,839
a 401k account with a hundred thousand

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,800
dollars in it

254
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
which by the way i think would be pretty

255
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,720
good um and then if you had that 10

256
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,000
federal fee i live in virginia and

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
um so that state fee is 5.75

258
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
so um 57.50 and then

259
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
let's just presume like you know a

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,519
general tax bracket

261
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
is not really what i am right now but

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
let's just say that was you know 25 000.

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,560
so

264
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
all of those fees are going to subtract

265
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,320
out of what you have in your

266
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
401k account and then you'll be left

267
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
with um in this example 59250

268
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
as your deposit that'll like go into

269
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
your actual bank account

270
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
and that's the money that you really

271
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
have to use

272
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
and to live off of um so that's it's

273
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
kind of like a few things you gotta keep

274
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,920
in mind

275
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
because if you uh if you think that

276
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,839
you're going to be able to

277
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
have all a hundred thousand to spend you

278
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,079
know that's not necessarily

279
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,519
true um so just be careful of that and

280
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
i guess one other thing i learned in the

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
withdrawal process

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
is that um because your

283
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
401k accounts are likely based on like

284
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
the real

285
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,480
market you know like stock market and

286
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,440
everything

287
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,200
um the amount that you are calculating

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,600
with

289
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
one day for like your 100 000

290
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
um that could maybe the next day be like

291
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,839
99 000 and some change just because of

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,959
those variances

293
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
in the market so that kind of threw me

294
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,560
for a loop because i wasn't

295
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
i didn't know about that so just a heads

296
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
up those could change a little bit

297
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
um there's also if you're looking at the

298
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,519
401k

299
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,680
option this is something i did not know

300
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,440
about and i kind of wish i had

301
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
um so i'm sharing it with you there's

302
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,839
also something called a 401k

303
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,720
loan and they're selectively available

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
so you'll have to check with your

305
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
exact account plan um but the great

306
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,160
thing is

307
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,880
that unlike the full withdrawal where

308
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
you're taking that money back in your

309
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
pocket

310
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,000
the loan is is a loan so it's actually

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,560
not

312
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,839
taxed it's not categorized as income

313
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
going into your wallet since it's a loan

314
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
which is kind of like a temporary thing

315
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
and um there could be interest on

316
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
the loan like kind of in normal loans

317
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
there's usually some type of interest

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
sometimes there is sometimes there's not

319
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,360
you'll have to check

320
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
and then um you know obviously if you

321
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
take the money as a loan from your

322
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
account but you don't

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
put it back you know in time or based on

324
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
whatever calendar terms that you have

325
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
um you will likely be facing some type

326
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
of fee

327
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
i i see that the 10 is a is a common

328
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,560
number so

329
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,000
you know you do have to be careful but

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
that was an option that um i wish i had

331
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
known about i might have done that

332
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,240
um and then obviously you know if you

333
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
have savings or you have

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
other you know sources of money that's

335
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,519
wonderful

336
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
but this is just what i what i did so

337
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,639
i'll share that with you

338
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
and obviously these are kind of

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
strange times and as such um

340
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,560
so covered has also affected

341
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,000
the rules and guidance behind

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
401k withdrawals and so

343
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
there are sort of a continuation

344
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
of guidance slash um modified

345
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,959
rules um that are kind of in the works

346
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,440
um

347
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
i just checked with some folks recently

348
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
and there's still no

349
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,440
final guidance out as of right now this

350
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,399
recording

351
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
um on this sort of like forgiveness if

352
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,240
you will

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
for um taking out a 401k withdrawal

354
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,880
um so basically that would as far as i

355
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
can tell would

356
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,160
sort of um forgive that 10 federal

357
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
fee and then who knows maybe there's

358
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
maybe the states will also do something

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
so we're not really sure but

360
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
there is something kind of in the works

361
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,440
there so something to think about

362
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
and um so i'm gonna pause just really

363
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,519
quickly because i know that's a lot of

364
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
information on the 401ks

365
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,120
um and then so the next sort of like

366
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
part of money

367
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
is not only money going in but money

368
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,079
going out

369
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
and i think a lot of people are really

370
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,839
curious about you know

371
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
how much would it cost to do your own

372
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,959
thing or

373
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
you know maybe even in the beginning or

374
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,240
total

375
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
right and so that was something that i

376
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
couldn't find

377
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
on the internet at all it was really

378
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,880
frustrating and i just

379
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,519
really hoped that i had enough money to

380
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,760
live off of and to pay whatever

381
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,240
i'm gonna need to pay so i'm gonna share

382
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,040
with you all

383
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,199
um my you know my information on what it

384
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,240
cost me

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,920
hopefully that can give you guys some

386
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
type of ballpark um

387
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,079
for the same types of things so let's

388
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
look at money going out because you're

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
going to want to think about this before

390
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,399
you

391
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,079
um really you know before you really

392
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,440
press any buttons and press

393
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
enter and take out money and and you

394
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,199
know quit your job if you're doing that

395
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,600
so

396
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
so kind of do some pre-planning here

397
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,760
what is what what are the finances that

398
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,560
you need

399
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
to live off of for your own personal

400
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
uh reasons like your housing or your

401
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,920
utilities and bills um savings

402
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
if you have any sort of like monthly

403
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
subscriptions that are um

404
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,800
auto paid right i donate to charity

405
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
quite frequently so that's something i

406
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,720
like to

407
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
also include and obviously your own

408
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,959
taxes and then also on the business side

409
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,760
of things

410
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,959
so um and we'll get more into this whole

411
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,560
column for the business

412
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
so um hang on for that but just sort of

413
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
like an overview

414
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
you'll see that there are filing and

415
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,240
formation fees

416
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
um services that you might need hardware

417
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,920
software

418
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
general supplies um labor like your own

419
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,240
kind of your own work

420
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,480
um again charity if that's something

421
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,440
that you want to do with your

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,399
organization

423
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,920
and of course taxes so yes um more on

424
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,040
the business stuff

425
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,079
later or actually really soon um but

426
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
just kind of an overview so

427
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,480
let's look at your money situation how

428
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
are you going to get money

429
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,959
how is it how are you going to spend

430
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,639
money and then the next

431
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,560
sort of like big thing that you should

432
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
probably think about

433
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
is your timing so for me

434
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,720
as i said um i was employed and then i

435
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,440
actually

436
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
um you know painfully uh resigned from

437
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
that position to focus on my own health

438
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,120
and

439
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
and bouncing back so um for me i kind of

440
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,519
had to really think about

441
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,560
the timing very carefully um

442
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
and you're going to want to plan out

443
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
like when is the best time to

444
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,759
leave if there is a best time i finished

445
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,560
a huge

446
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,680
project for my organization um

447
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
and wrapped that completely up before

448
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,519
you know i pulled the trigger so to

449
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,240
speak

450
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,320
and i just felt like that was the right

451
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
thing to do for me

452
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
and um you also might want to consider

453
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
like do you have a goal

454
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,360
of when you want to begin your actual

455
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,000
work for

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
clients um as well as chiming for

457
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,800
finances right like if uh depending upon

458
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
your money situation you might really

459
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
need to start sooner than later

460
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
or something like that so um

461
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
you're going to want to also just kind

462
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
of think related to timing about your

463
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
your goals as it pertains to time so

464
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,600
like

465
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
when do you when would you like to make

466
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
your announcement

467
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,199
at least to your network or you know who

468
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,639
it could be your friends or your family

469
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,120
or

470
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
it could be to the public right when are

471
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
you going to want to announce

472
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
when do you want to have your first

473
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
client solidified and you know the

474
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
contract sign

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,800
and then also again financially uh when

476
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,920
do you need

477
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,320
to have money coming in because that

478
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,120
will also play a role in the timing

479
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,560
um let's also touch

480
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
on the third aspect that you're going to

481
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,000
want to think about

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,760
potentially if you're also in a similar

483
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,119
situation which is the leaving aspect

484
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,760
um and so as i mentioned you know for me

485
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,160
i

486
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,640
had quit a job and then i had some time

487
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,520
to heal

488
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
and then i was going to start on this

489
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,919
journey to make my own company

490
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,439
um so um let's

491
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
let's dive into this more so like

492
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,520
contracts really

493
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
for me and for a lot of other folks out

494
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,559
there who have employment contracts

495
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
and this is nothing like specifically to

496
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
what i had but just in general this is

497
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,080
kind of stuff that you could see

498
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,440
so you might see you know contractual

499
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,000
terms

500
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
in your employment agreement about

501
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,360
payments

502
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,240
pay benefits um non-competition

503
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
non-disclosure

504
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
ownership of discoveries and uh maybe

505
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
even governing law which basically just

506
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,600
says

507
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,799
where which state does your contract

508
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,440
kind of like uh which state does your

509
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,760
contract follow the laws of

510
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
if you were looking at it in a legal way

511
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
it would be pertaining to how let's say

512
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,480
texas

513
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,520
looks at those laws opposed to a

514
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,799
different contract

515
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,000
that was kind of like written

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,120
for governing law in like alabama would

517
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,760
be

518
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,440
different legal laws as it pertains to

519
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,799
the contract so you might see those

520
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,840
things too

521
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,760
um and i guess you know the one thing

522
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,640
i would really recommend is that you do

523
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,039
uh

524
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,080
consider getting an attorney to help

525
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
look through your contract and your

526
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,200
agreement

527
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
and um especially just so you can

528
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,039
understand

529
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,280
any things that are binding that you

530
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
have to consider

531
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
like a lot of the non-competition

532
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,440
non-disclosure

533
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
that kind of stuff that will be you know

534
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,760
anywhere from six to 24 months

535
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,679
um that you're binded to that and so

536
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,039
that is a very serious thing that you

537
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,840
should you know

538
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,160
um abide by obviously you're

539
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,200
contractually

540
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
supposed to and um you're going to just

541
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
want to understand

542
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,320
also like potentially for your business

543
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,679
what um what can you do what can you not

544
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,559
do

545
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,280
um and just kind of like get clarity on

546
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
any gray areas that might exist

547
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
so in a lot of cases maybe there's no

548
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
really you know there's no reason for

549
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
concern you're doing something totally

550
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,799
different

551
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
or you're providing a different service

552
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
right so but i think it's a good thing

553
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,440
to

554
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
um to gain clarity on and i would highly

555
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
recommend that anyone do that for me it

556
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
was a great investment

557
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,120
for me to seek my own legal counsel and

558
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,559
so

559
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,840
for example like if my contract were

560
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,880
written governing law in nevada i would

561
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,360
have

562
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,720
sought out an employment lawyer who

563
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
had was able to practice in that state

564
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,400
of nevada

565
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,760
right so you're going to want to match

566
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,000
whatever your contract says

567
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
um so that's probably you know

568
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
you know very important step that i

569
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,280
would recommend

570
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
in addition to the money situation the

571
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
timing situation and then your

572
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,799
sort of like legal situation right so i

573
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,000
told you we would go back

574
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,320
into the business expenses and so that's

575
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
what i'm gonna do for you right now

576
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,799
and then um sort of at the end you'll be

577
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,600
able to see

578
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,440
you know feel free to take a screenshot

579
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
or whatever um

580
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,240
what what we're dealing with here so um

581
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,120
first thing

582
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,159
filing and formation costs

583
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
so um just so you know a lot of people

584
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
get a little bit worried about like oh

585
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,200
what should i call my business

586
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
and actually um you can change the name

587
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,720
of your business

588
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,360
at any time it's like a ten dollar fee

589
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
to do that it's really not a big deal so

590
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
don't freak out too much about that and

591
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
like get caught up on that

592
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
really um there's a simple little form

593
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
you can you can file it's like i think

594
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
it's ten dollars

595
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,159
um so don't worry you can just call it

596
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,840
you know ally's

597
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,919
cool business and change it later like

598
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,120
it's it's really fine

599
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,559
um don't let that stop you and um

600
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,960
there's a lot of confusion and a lot of

601
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,600
um

602
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,840
i would say conflicting opinions

603
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,440
especially on the internet

604
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
of you know how should you file where sh

605
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,159
what state should you file

606
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,280
and um what several professionals have

607
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
told me

608
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,799
um is that it's actually you know not

609
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,760
really worth it

610
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,320
for a small business that is likely

611
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
going to remain

612
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,240
a small medium business to file in one

613
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
of those friendly states like everyone

614
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,520
always says delaware

615
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,720
or um nevada or there's a couple other

616
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
ones that are like popular

617
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
so really the whole scenario behind that

618
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,679
is

619
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,080
um you know it's only really helpful if

620
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
your company eventually

621
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,360
is like going to go public or have stock

622
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,240
you know or be an actual corporation um

623
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
those protections

624
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,919
may at times help those types of

625
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,600
companies but for myself i knew i wasn't

626
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,799
going to do that just a little

627
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
just below me maybe some employees

628
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
eventually or something like that so

629
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,919
everyone said no no just just file um

630
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,559
you know

631
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
somewhere that's convenient to you like

632
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
where you live so

633
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,640
just something to also consider um

634
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,200
there's

635
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,799
there's legal zoom you know services

636
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,039
like that can that can help you through

637
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
the filing formation process for your

638
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,080
business

639
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,120
um the one thing that i had found out

640
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,559
was that um

641
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,520
especially sorry legalzoom but um i had

642
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,880
heard that you know

643
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
some of the services that they bundled

644
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,159
in were not

645
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,440
actually necessary for what you need to

646
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,240
do and then

647
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,039
actually kind of negatively sometimes

648
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,760
you have to

649
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
undo paperwork that was unnecessary

650
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
in the beginning and undo that um and

651
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,720
that can be

652
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,600
you know costly time and money so i was

653
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
kind of a little bit wary about that

654
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
once i found that out

655
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
um so i i decided to go with a

656
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,120
friend that i knew um and an accounting

657
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,919
firm

658
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,080
that provided those business formation

659
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,039
services

660
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,960
um and you know that was a lot of there

661
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,320
was a lot of trust there and a lot of

662
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
personal relationships there so that was

663
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,120
really great

664
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,720
um also just real quick on tax

665
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,000
classifications because this is

666
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,080
something that's really important to

667
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
you know the tax part of your business

668
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,120
um

669
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
there's the sole proprietorship and

670
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,240
that's really so like your taxes

671
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,360
um with the business are basically

672
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
considered like just whatever your

673
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,400
personal

674
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
tax situation is there's like not really

675
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,520
a distinguishing

676
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,159
um factor there so that's what a sole

677
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,200
proprietorship is

678
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
in terms of the tax classifications um

679
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,039
the s corp um is basically like

680
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,080
you'll see this word pass through um

681
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,360
which basically means that if you have

682
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,159
your

683
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,360
business um taxes over here and then you

684
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,039
have your personal taxes

685
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,159
over here in an s corp tax

686
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,159
classification your business taxes

687
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,679
pass through your personal

688
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,720
tax like bracket or situation so

689
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,880
they're separate but when it comes down

690
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,320
to it the

691
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,520
business tax situation just goes through

692
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
to whatever your personal situation

693
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,840
happens to be at that time

694
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,120
um there's also you know kind of

695
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,919
on a larger scale there's the c corp and

696
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,679
um you know partnership

697
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,000
tax classifications which you know i i

698
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
wasn't involved with

699
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,360
um but that's basically like a c corp

700
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,440
would be your text on your business

701
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,400
stuff

702
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,799
plus you're also you know taxed on your

703
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,000
personal stuff

704
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,679
so instead of the pass-through where

705
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,279
you're kind of like benefiting because

706
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,880
you're only being taxed on like one

707
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,919
situation

708
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,760
because it passes through you would be

709
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,679
taxed on both so

710
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,880
um and then again for the sole

711
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,039
proprietorship um there's really not

712
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,400
even two it's just one

713
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,159
so hopefully that makes sense feel free

714
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,000
to you know chat in any questions on

715
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,799
that

716
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
um let's see and then just so you know

717
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,039
so an llc

718
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,520
limited liability corporation um it's

719
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,080
actually

720
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
not a tax classification in and of

721
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,840
itself

722
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,120
it's a type of business and so if you

723
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,559
decide to you know make an llc like i

724
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,200
did

725
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,320
you will also have to choose what type

726
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,720
of

727
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
tax classification you would like

728
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
because it's not inherently

729
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,799
uh one already so you'll kind of you

730
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,320
know do both things

731
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,840
um so that was interesting i didn't know

732
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
that so i had chosen the s corp the

733
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,279
pass-through

734
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,559
um to complement my llc business status

735
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
um also so this is kind of like some

736
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
really good checklist stuff for you

737
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,200
and then hopefully when you are able to

738
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,760
um

739
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,600
you know receive a copy of this

740
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,559
presentation or you can dm me or chat me

741
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,760
i do have embedded links to these

742
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
actual forms and resources in here again

743
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
they might have changed or been updated

744
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,559
but

745
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,799
you'll be able to get a good sense for

746
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,679
what's involved

747
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,520
so um for me i wanted to

748
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,559
you know protect my privacy and

749
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,720
my personal information so i decided to

750
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,159
get a virtual

751
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,799
business address so that i wouldn't have

752
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,320
to put my home address

753
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,960
on any of these forms that some of them

754
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,640
are public some of them aren't

755
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
um and so that's something to consider

756
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
especially if you're in you know

757
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,400
security um and then in order to do that

758
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
you'll have to sort of like

759
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,279
um allow that business to

760
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,279
be able to take in your mail so there's

761
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
a little form from the usps that you'll

762
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
have to do

763
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,559
and i think it's free to file but you do

764
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,960
have to like give them authorization

765
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,320
um there's also something in the filings

766
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,480
like process where you can hire

767
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,559
something called a registered agent

768
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,679
and that person or some entity will

769
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,000
register all of your paperwork and stuff

770
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,039
on your behalf

771
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,880
with their personal or you know their

772
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,559
professional information

773
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
so that uh you know you wouldn't have to

774
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,600
file

775
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
these official paperworks with your home

776
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
address and your

777
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
cell phone and things like that so those

778
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,919
are two um

779
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,159
nice services that are totally optional

780
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,559
but i decided to spring for those

781
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,360
just to protect my own information um

782
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,559
you'll have to get your

783
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
employer identification number which is

784
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
you know pretty simple process

785
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
but there's a form for that you'll have

786
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
to file your articles of organization

787
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,559
which again um is kind of you know

788
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,360
specific to

789
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,200
an llc situation you'll have to

790
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
um file if you're gonna sort of

791
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,679
go about business with a different name

792
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,080
than

793
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
what um you're going to put in the

794
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,919
paperwork so that's like doing business

795
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,320
as

796
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,399
dba you'll have to do that little form

797
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
and i think that's the one that's 10

798
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,320
and then you'll also have to let the

799
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,679
government know

800
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,080
what type of tax classification you

801
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
actually want to

802
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,279
to be you know seen as so there's a

803
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,480
little form they have to fill out for

804
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
that so for me is escort perform

805
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,679
um and then i live is bad upset but i

806
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,960
live in arlington

807
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,799
virginia and so um arlington county

808
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,080
or arlington city um also has like a

809
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
little process that you have to go

810
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
through

811
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,200
to just sort of get your license uh your

812
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,399
certificate of

813
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,760
occupancy etc so um that was pretty easy

814
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,279
to do i don't think it cost me anything

815
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:33,600
just

816
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,120
just a little bit of time um and again

817
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
the blue ones are all um totally

818
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,720
optional

819
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
but ones that you know may be

820
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,360
recommended for your situation

821
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,840
um and these are the costs right so this

822
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,279
is should be hopefully really helpful

823
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,880
um for me you know you can see 60 to 100

824
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,760
um monthly fee for having that virtual

825
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,320
business

826
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
address so i can use their address for

827
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,520
everything

828
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,159
their services and registered agent that

829
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,600
was a one-time

830
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,399
yeah that was a one-time fee um and you

831
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:06,880
can see

832
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,080
some of the filing paper fees um that go

833
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,200
along with that

834
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,880
okay and then oh

835
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,279
this presentation is actually worth at

836
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,480
least 450

837
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
because that's what i paid some

838
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,039
professionals to help me through this

839
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,240
process so

840
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,760
you're welcome okay and we talked

841
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
already about the expenses sort of money

842
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,120
going out

843
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,039
and just want to quickly go touch on

844
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,240
services

845
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
so for services you might need those

846
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,919
attorneys that i talked about

847
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,440
sometimes i'll be depending upon where

848
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520

853
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,080
um if you have accountants and payroll

854
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
folks which i would highly recommend you

855
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,080
get

856
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
because i'm not a tax professional i

857
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,279
don't want to mess that stuff up

858
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,159
they range from like 50 for sort of the

859
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,039
admin help

860
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,880
to upwards of 200 if you're getting like

861
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,799
the top person out there

862
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,159
firm um for filing assistance

863
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,080
again i told you that i had used that

864
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
accounting firm because they offered

865
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,240
that as

866
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,520
as a service and um i think that was

867
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,399
actually

868
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,000
um the 450 that i just told you about

869
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,320
um you'll also want to consider your

870
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,279
business insurance so don't forget this

871
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,880
um there's largely three types of just

872
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,279
like

873
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,440
you know baseline insurance when you get

874
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,720
into more specified

875
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,440
types of work and services and products

876
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,039
you'll have additional different like

877
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,279
you know specific types but in general

878
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,559
you'll have your general insurance your

879
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,240
data breach insurance which we should

880
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,760
all be semi familiar with

881
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,640
what that is and also your professional

882
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,360
insurance

883
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
and so um annually that can range

884
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,600
depending upon you know your your

885
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,960
providers i actually

886
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,600
i went through my sort of auto insurance

887
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,880
provider and they

888
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
were able to hook me up with a really

889
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,399
good um

890
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,480

893
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,840
good tip to maybe kind of

894
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,919

you don't already know it all yourself

913
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,519

any hr

919
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,760
services i actually used to work for an

920
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,640
association

921
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,279
that you'll see this peo is linked and

922
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,880
that's a professional employer

923
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,919
organization

924
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,640
and they kind of do like outsource hr so

925
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,000
they're companies and they handle all

926
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,880
your stuff

927
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
and you can look into that if you have

928
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
any questions let me know because i used

929
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,720
to work for them

930
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,039
um and then you know marketing or

931
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,440
administrative expenses right just kind

932
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
of those ancillary things

933
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,640
um oh also just be careful

934
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,000
there are um sometimes minimum dollar

935
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,840
amounts that you need to have in your

936
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,799
bank account

937
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,159
um so you don't well so you avoid any

938
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,840
you know recurring business fees like

939
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
just to have the accounts kind of silly

940
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
but it happens um

941
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,080
my bank minimum was like 500 which is

942
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,039
kind of significant

943
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,240
so or else i was going to incur a 20

944
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,559
fee every month so something to keep in

945
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,000
mind i didn't know that

946
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,440
um okay really quick on hardware

947
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
obviously you know you're gonna want to

948
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
have some type of

949
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,360
computer system um i ended up chatting

950
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,480
with dell

951
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,279
um on sort of the chat feature and had a

952
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,200
really great experience with some of the

953
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
folks over there

954
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
who helped me get a custom quote on my

955
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,640
laptop

956
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,120
um and obviously there's a newer model

957
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,480
available but that was something i

958
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,039
didn't know

959
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,279
you could do and it actually saved me

960
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,480
quite a bit of money

961
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
also took quite a bit of time not sure

962
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
if it's because it was custom or because

963
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:26,720
of the

964
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,279
you know the crazy times operationally

965
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,080
logistically

966
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
but um keep that in mind too it could

967
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,720
take some time to get your laptop

968
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,039
software you should be familiar

969
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,320
obviously you're going to need some type

970
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,000
of you know domain host

971
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,200
um a website maybe your

972
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
sort of email slash you know just data

973
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,159
organization system right office 365 or

974
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
google suite right there's other options

975
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,440
and you can kind of

976
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,760
decide what you want to do there um if

977
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,960
you're going to do some accounting

978
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,760
software

979
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
you know something like quickbooks if

980
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
you need professional

981
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,399
software like your a professional

982
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,200
linkedin

983
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
account that's something to consider if

984
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
you want to get the upgraded version

985
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,399
of anything that's freemium like um like

986
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,079
a web meeting service or something like

987
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:14,879
that

988
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,719
or you know if you need a creative

989
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,119
software um so lots of stuff to consider

990
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,000
and especially depending

991
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
upon what you actually end up doing um

992
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,839
so this is kind of what

993
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,719
it costs for me which was not too bad

994
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,480
but um something to consider for our

995
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,719
finances

996
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,960
and um just really quick you know on

997
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
labor so

998
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,280
basically eventually you'll get into all

999
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,000
of this

1000
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,159
um you know paying yourself a salary and

1001
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,839
if you have other employees

1002
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,960
um your own benefits and health care um

1003
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,199
if you want to do a 401k program you

1004
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,280
know your training budget if you want to

1005
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,079
have that

1006
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,800
conference attendance headshots i was

1007
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,079
able to get that for free because there

1008
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,960
was a program

1009
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,760
um sort of within the the coveted times

1010
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,119
that was really helpful they did free

1011
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,240
headshots

1012
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,320
um so you can kind of look for things

1013
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,839
that pop up for that

1014

you know business cards equipment

1015
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,359
supplies licenses like there's a whole

1016
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,400
bunch of stuff

1017
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,040
um that can come up that you know you

1018
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,440
can

1019
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,320
you can be aware of so we're nearing the

1020
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,040
end here

1021
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,320
and we're going to do a quick running

1022
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,200
calling um

1023
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,240
total if hopefully you know my math

1024
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,839
checks out here but total

1025
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,640
it took me about four thousand seven

1026
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,240
hundred eighty four dollars to

1027
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,960
start up and that was over the course of

1028
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,839
i think about

1029
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,440
eight weeks because i took it very slow

1030
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
as i told you

1031
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,240
um and yeah it's over eight weeks

1032
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,599
and um so right now fast forward i

1033
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,160
actually have two companies um the one

1034
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,359
that i started

1035
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,000
and then i joined another small business

1036
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,040
um

1037
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,359
and i'm a partner for that i have

1038
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,480

industry um explore

1047

really happy because

1049
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,440
the one thing i knew before i even

1051
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
any of these steps that i talked about

1052
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,400
the one thing i knew i said look

1053
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,119
if i can figure this out and get it all

1054
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,320

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,599
i'm going to share this with everybody

1058
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,920
because i want everybody else to be able

1059
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,720
to

1060
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,440

themselves

1062
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
or do their own thing or um you know

1063
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
just follow their own dream and so

1064
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
