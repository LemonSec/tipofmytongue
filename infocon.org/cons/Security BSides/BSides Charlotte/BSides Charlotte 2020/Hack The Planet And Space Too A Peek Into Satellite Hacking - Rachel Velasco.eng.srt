1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,279
alrighty hello everyone

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,400
this is hack the planet and space two a

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,120
very quick

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,080
introduction to satellite hacking so i

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,360
am rachel velasco

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
and thank you so much for supporting

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,279
visa charlotte this year

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
so let's get started a little bit more

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
about me every time i play among us

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
i have one of the imposters without fail

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,519
and

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
the theme of this year's b-sides is what

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
i learned in quarantine

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,920
and unfortunately i was one of the many

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,559
people

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,280
whose mental health was greatly affected

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,879
by the pandemic

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,079
so my depression anxiety i've been

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,000
struggling with those for several years

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
now and

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
it definitely works in my impostor

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,559
syndrome within

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,960
infosec and i couldn't find any joy

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
with my work or with what i was learning

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,640
in school

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
and i felt that i was constantly

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
defending myself

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,559
and having to explain why i belonged in

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
infosec

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
and eventually it got to the point where

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
i thought it would be so much better if

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,360
i just got ejected but anyway

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,040
my uh treatment plan was revised and

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
one of the first things that i got

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
excited about in a long time that felt

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
like a long time was

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
i'm satellite hacking and i'm excuse me

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,119
i am back to work now in school and i've

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
taken up some leadership roles in some

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
tech organizations

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
and i'm definitely not an expert but i

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
am very excited to share

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
what i learned about hacking space with

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,640
all of y'all

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
so let's go over the agenda

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
i'll be discussing exactly what

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,600
satellites are

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,320
how you can go about attacking them and

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
more resources for learning more on your

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:54,799
own

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
and getting some practice in

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
so satellites but first

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,719
i have some news in march

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,439
of this year this article came out how

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
space is becoming

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,760
a lot more dangerous and the

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
army space and missile defense commander

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
he said that they have a lot

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,120
of new tools like interceptors which is

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,599
anti-missile weapons hypersonic missiles

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,599
and directed energy weapons

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,800
and he said it was pretty darn awesome

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,400
yes that is super awesome however

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,519
they are applying this technology to

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
satellites and just a couple of months

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,239
ago as of this recording

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,599
um russia conducted an anti-satellite

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,879
weapons test

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,840
but this anti-satellite weapon is on a

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
satellite

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,280
so these satellites are becoming more

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
and more dangerous

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
so why would you want to hack a

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,840
satellite

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
what even is a satellite well

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
in this context an artificial satellite

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
is any object that was intentionally

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,760
placed

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
into orbit and they have a lot of

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
different purposes

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
depending on what orbit they're on

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
but for the most part there's

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,879
communications

84
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,599
navigation for science like weather

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,200
monitoring and whatnot

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,519
and for recon there are a lot of spy

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,840
satellites up there right now

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,640
so the orbits by altitude

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
i'm only going to be talking about three

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
but there are quite a lot of them

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
and this first one is called the

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
low earth orbit and satellites here

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,280
they they're generally for uh

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
communications but you'll also find the

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,920
international space station

96
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
the hubble telescope and the us iridium

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,599
communication satellite system

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
and this requires the lowest amount of

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,400
energy to

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
deploy and keep in orbit next

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
we have the medium earth orbit

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
and there's a subclassification called

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,120
semi-synchronous and what that means

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,839
is it's consistent the satellites on

105
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,798
this orbit

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
pass the same two spots on the equator

107
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,720
every single day

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
and in medium earth orbit you'll tend to

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
find a lot of the navigational

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,160
satellites

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
like gps and glonass which is

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,000
i believe global navigation satellite

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
system

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,919
and finally the last one is not high

115
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
earth orbit even though it is

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
considered an orbit but it is a

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
geosynchronous orbit

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,360
so geosynchronous means that

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
um at the same time every day you will

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
find the satellite at the same point in

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
the sky

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
excuse me and there's a special kind of

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,720
geosynchronous satellite called

124
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,360
geostationary

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
and geostationary means that

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
it doesn't matter what time of day you

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
look up in the sky that satellite will

128
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,479
always be in the same spot

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
and of the geostationary satellites

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,160
a lot of them will be commercial

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,440
communications

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,479
or broadcasting and since it's so high

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,520
up

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
they'll have a constant view of a large

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
surface area from up there

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
there's also the geostationary

137
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,039
operational environmental satellites or

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,160
the goes

139
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
so a lot of these

140
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
they they tend to function

141
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
uh like scientifically they have uh

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,039
weather monitoring you can see all the

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,600
hurricanes wildfires from up there

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
and they can also detect distress

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
signals from

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759
ships and planes so they're also very

147
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
helpful with

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
search and rescue and a little bit past

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,800
the geostationary orbit is the graveyard

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,520
orbit

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,758
and this is where satellites go to die

152
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,240
and all these defunct satellites

153
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
that no longer serve their purpose or

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
have broken and can't be fixed for some

155
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
reason they end up becoming space debris

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
and china tried solving this problem

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,319
with an

158
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
anti-satellite missile and it did

159
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
hit the satellite that they were

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
intending to hit

161
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,319
but it just split into a bajillion more

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,120
pieces and spread it out everywhere

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
so yes and

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
there's also the problem of collisions

165
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
there's the space debris and the still

166
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,199
functional satellites

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
not too long ago there was a defunct

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
russian satellite that collided with a

169
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
functioning u.s iridium satellite

170
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,039
and they ended up um

171
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,240
colliding yes and their

172
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
debris went back to earth and so there's

173
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
a lot of like radioactive material

174
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,000
that they dumped and i think it landed

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
in the u.s

176
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,000
um so that's a giant problem with

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
these uh defunct satellites colliding

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
and there's also the issue of light

179
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
pollution

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
all of these satellites in orbit are

181
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
blocking the view

182
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,599
of other celestial bodies so scientists

183
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,639
have been complaining about this

184
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
now how do you go about attacking

185
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
satellites

186
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
there's this wonderful paper by the u.s

187
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,840
air force nasik

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
called competing in space and

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
there are a couple uh threats that they

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
list to space systems

191
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,319
so i'll be talking about the user and

192
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,199
ground segment

193
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,000
in one part and then the link segment

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
and the space segment

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,960
and if you noticed there are a lot

196
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,319
of familiar terms because

197
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
satellites are basically computers so

198
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
what they call the signals that a

199
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
satellite receives is the uplink

200
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
the down link is the signals that the

201
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
satellite sends down back to earth to

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,199
ground stations and to phones and

203
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,080
whatever other

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,520
endpoints there are so what exactly

205
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
is a ground station it's just a fancy

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,240
radio station

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,720
that communicates exclusively with a

208
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,919
satellite

209
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,880
and honestly it's just a fancy computer

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,200
and

211
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
antenna combination so this would be the

212
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,958
cheapest way

213
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
to take over the satellite since you

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
could just hack into it like you

215
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
normally would a

216
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
usual computer but unfortunately

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
since it is a usual computer there are

218
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
logs

219
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
so there will be a trace of when you

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,000
have like

221
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,399
tried to interfere with this ground

222
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,360
station

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
and there was this instance back i

224
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,760
believe it was 2008

225
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,120
there was the terra earth observation

226
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
system satellite

227
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
and nasa found that the responsible

228
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,800
party

229
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
achieved all steps required to command

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,080
the satellite

231
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
but did not issue commands so whoever

232
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,680
hacked into this satellite

233
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
they had control over it but they didn't

234
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:24,800
issue

235
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
any commands to like change its

236
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
inclination

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
or anything but this happened 10 years

238
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,240
ago

239
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,279
so satellite hacking is not a new thing

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,160
next we have the link segment so

241
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
satellites have

242
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
a communication payload module which

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
have

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,839
a transmitter receiver on it or a

245
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,800
transponder they usually have

246
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,080
a bandpass filter so this makes sure

247
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,839
it it only allows frequencies within a

248
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,120
certain range

249
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
and they will also have a low noise

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
amplifier

251
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
because these signals tend to travel

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
very long distances from the ground

253
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,000
stations

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,240
so it will amplify those signals and

255
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,519
make sure they are

256
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,720
heard and like with typical wireless

257
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,360
attacks

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
um satellite link segment attacks are

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,839
um susceptible to spoofing

260
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
replay attacks and eavesdropping there

261
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
was a wonderful talk

262
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,839
earlier um this year at defcon by james

263
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,800
paver

264
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,440
called whispers among the stars about

265
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,839
them

266
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
eavesdropping on satellite

267
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
communications and it was very cool but

268
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
also very scary

269
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
and finally we have

270
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,920
jamming so there have been many

271
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,040
instances

272
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
of countries jamming each other's

273
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,079
satellites

274
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
and what jamming what makes jamming

275
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
different from normal interference

276
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
is that jamming is intentional so

277
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
there have been times where the us

278
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
has they have found

279
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
iran jamming their gps satellites

280
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
there's been issues with russia

281
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,199
and china and all the usual people

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,560
now this space segment

283
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
can you physically hack a satellite

284
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
that's in space

285
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
yes you can slap a hardware implant on

286
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,079
there but that requires a lot of money

287
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
so this is normally uh reserved for

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
nation state actors

289
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,240
and bored billionaires but

290
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
this is purely theoretical there's not a

291
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
lot that we know about it

292
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
and it probably has happened but it's

293
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,800
very highly classified so to recap

294
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
the threats to satellites there is the

295
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
grounding user component

296
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,079
the link segment and the space segment

297
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,079
so here are some more resources for

298
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,199
learning more on your own

299
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,000
there is this cool open source project

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,519
called sat nags

301
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
and it's a network of many ground

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,040
stations

303
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
are just made by average people

304
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,279
and they have a crowdsource satellite

305
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,160
info

306
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,120
database and there's actually one fairly

307
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
close to here

308
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,160
i believe it's in weddington and that's

309
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
station 642 and you can see

310
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
all the satellites that it's been

311
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,880
tracking it's very very cool

312
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,160
and the aerospace village this year had

313
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
nyansa

314
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
and this was a giant collaboration with

315
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,800
the us

316
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
air force and red balloon security and

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,399
they had a build your own ground station

318
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,680
kit for only a dollar

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
so as you can imagine they sold out very

320
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,519
very quickly

321
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
but they do have all the parts listed on

322
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,959
their website

323
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,760
for building your own ground station

324
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,480
with them

325
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
and there's a lot of helpful info on

326
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
their website still

327
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,000
and finally we have a lot of

328
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
simulation software from nasa there is

329
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,720
42 which is simulating

330
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,279
altitude and trajectory dynamics there

331
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,639
is a lot of math

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,200
involved with hacking satellites which i

333
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
definitely will not go into

334
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,279
but um 42 is very helpful

335
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
with determining the math

336
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,639
you need for hacking a satellite since

337
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
you have to be able to see them to hack

338
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,760
it

339
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
and there is also uh nas cubed

340
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
the nasa operational simulator for small

341
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,959
satellites

342
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
and there is also this very cool project

343
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,000
called the cubesat sim project

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,880
and a cubesat is a very very tiny

345
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
simulator it's or sorry

346
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,680
a very tiny satellite and it only weighs

347
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,639
a couple pounds

348
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
so there are quite a lot of them um up

349
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,839
in orbit right now

350
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
and i actually got to build my own as

351
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
well and it is sitting in my closet

352
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
unfortunately

353
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
but yes it's fairly cheap all the parts

354
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:04,959
together

355
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
are less than a hundred dollars to build

356
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
your own so i highly recommend

357
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,359
uh building your own cubesat sim

358
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,560
so some more organizations to learn from

359
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,519
highly recommend

360
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,560
the aerospace village they have all of

361
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,880
their talks and workshops

362
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
from this year's defcon on their youtube

363
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,639
channel

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
there's also the defense digital service

365
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
they they were the ones who ran the

366
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,040
hackasat competition at defcon this year

367
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,639
and finally the library space foundation

368
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,160
they are a

369
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
big organization they have many open

370
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
source projects like the satnags

371
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
they also have the upsat

372
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
cubesat and pocket cube satellites that

373
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,800
you can build on your own

374
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,760
so there's a lot of cool documentation

375
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
on their website and i highly

376
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
suggest checking them out

377
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
so thank you very much i am rachel

378

379
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,839
and please let me know if you have any

380
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
questions i will definitely do my best

381
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
to answer them

382
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,920
but again i am not an expert but yes

383
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,160
hack the planet in space
