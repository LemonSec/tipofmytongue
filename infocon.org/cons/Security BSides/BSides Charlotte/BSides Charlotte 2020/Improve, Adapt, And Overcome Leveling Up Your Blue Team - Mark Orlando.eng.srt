1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
hi everyone welcome to improvise adapt

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,680
and overcome leveling up your blue team

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,120
i am mark orlando

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,320
and over the next 50 or so minutes we're

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,240
going to talk about ways that

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
you can level up your blue team and i'll

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,239
talk about some of

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,840
my experiences uh both positive and

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,119
uh not so positive and uh we'll talk

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:23,840
through

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,199
a variety of different things within

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
blue team and for the purposes of this

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,199
discussion

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,359
whatever blue team means to you however

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
you define that i'm going to use the

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
phrase blue team

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,520
and security operations and cyber

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
defense all of those are going to be

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
somewhat interchangeable for the

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
purposes of this talk

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,719
so digging into a little bit more detail

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,920
over the next several minutes we're

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,120
going to talk about some common

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,399
challenges that

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
we all face that i've seen many many

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,480
times working with various blue teams

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,719
and what we can do to address and

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
overcome those challenges

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,760
we'll talk about some of the

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
fundamentals basic things that

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
if you're not doing if you're not doing

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,200
right or well

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
you're really going to have a tough time

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,479
leveling up and making the kinds of

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,920
improvements and having the kinds of

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,880
impact

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,439
that you want to have we'll talk about

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,400
measurement

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
right so you can't manage you can't

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
improve what you can't measure we'll

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,799
talk about ways

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,920
that we can do that so that we know how

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759
and when we're improving

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,159
some of the pitfalls in making some of

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
those improvements and trying to get

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,119
where you want to be

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,200
and then my favorite part of the talk

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,360
which is dumb things that i've done

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
so mistakes that i will share with you

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,280
that hopefully you can learn from

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,439
and i'll share a little bit about what i

52
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
learned from those as well

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
and we'll talk uh close out by talking

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,119
about things that you can do

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,720
today and things that you can do in the

56
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
coming weeks and months

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
and beyond to make

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
specific measurable improvements in your

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,479
security operations and in your blue

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:00,799
team

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
so let's dive in why me why am i the

62
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,360
person

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
that's giving this talk today so

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
blue team is a passion of mine it's

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,440
where i've spent

66
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
all of my career in security for the

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
most part

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
going back about 19 years that i've been

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,080
working in security operations

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
today i'm the co-founder and the ceo of

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,680
bionic

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
which is a blue team focused uh cyber

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
security company

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
before that i built and led and worked

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
in security teams

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
at the white house the department of

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,879
energy i was the cto for raytheon's

78
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,519
cyber business and i spent many years on

79
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
the managed security service provider

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
and mdr side of things

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
as well working with a variety of

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
different customers

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
i'm also an instructor at the sands

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
institute i teach

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
sec 450 which is blue team fundamentals

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
security operations

87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
and analysis

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
now why am i giving this talk

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
it's a very good question so in my

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
experience

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
especially in recent years i've seen a

92
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
lot of investments

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,319
going into security operations and into

94
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,000
blue team and of course we can always do

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
more and do better

96
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
but by and large organizations are

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
spending a lot of money on their cyber

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,000
defense

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
these days and in doing that we tend to

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,599
focus

101
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,159
a lot on the technical by this by that

102
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,840
add this technology you have to

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
have that technology but we often miss

104
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,280
some of the

105
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,920
other stuff some of the really important

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,799
stuff

107
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
that makes those technologies effective

108
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
and enables us to have a real meaningful

109
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,799
impact in driving risk down

110
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
defending the these enterprises for

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,080
which we're responsible

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
for and unfortunately again by and large

113
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,040
in the aggregate we're still failing

114
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
right sure we're having some success

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
we're moving the needle

116
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
uh you know in in some senses but

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
breaches are still happening uh you know

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,799
we're still getting

119
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
compromised uh we're hearing about this

120
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
stuff all

121
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,959
the time and we're not driving up

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,319
attacker cost

123
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
uh really as much as we should be for

124
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
the amount of money and resources that

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,400
we're spending

126
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
on this problem so in order to really

127
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,160
start

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
driving things in the direction that we

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
need to drive them

130
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
we need to make a mind shift and

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
in doing that the reality is that we can

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
do a lot without

133
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,240
a huge investment we can do a lot

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
without the most expensive

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
you know next-gen advanced technology

136
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,919
that's on the market

137
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,919
we can also do it without building up a

138
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,040
huge you know

139
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
unsustainable security team and so

140
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
this talk for you know the rest of our

141
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,639
time together

142
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,479
i'm going to focus on kind of the

143
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,960
non-technical parts of blue team kind of

144
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
how the teams are run

145
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
what are the things we need to focus on

146
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
um there are other

147
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
really really great presentations and

148
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
resources out there that address

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,320
you know the technical end of um defense

150
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
and blue team but we're gonna focus

151
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
primarily not 100

152
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,160
but primarily on some of those other

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
areas where we need to focus that

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
other stuff so just to set the

155
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,199
stage for the rest of our discussion

156
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
here what are the challenges

157
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
that i've seen in my experience working

158
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,680
in this part of the security field

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
and these are some of the major ones

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
first off is lack of business alignment

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
this is probably not news to anyone

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
who's on the receiving end of this

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
presentation

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
but what i see is that security teams

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
often operate in a vacuum or

166
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
you know maybe according to some kind of

167
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
generic set of best practices

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,800
you know not so much aligned to the

169
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,199
enterprise that they're defending

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,840
so we often forget you know or lose

171
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
sight of the fact that businesses don't

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
exist

173
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
to be secure we're there to support the

174
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
users to

175
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,319
enable the business or the agency or the

176
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,440
organization

177
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
to do what it does to generate the value

178
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,039
that it generates

179
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,000
in a secure way we won't always be able

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
to do that sometimes

181
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
we have to take a back seat to that

182
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,479
mission or that business but

183
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,199
either way i still see many teams that

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,000
are just not

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,319
fully aligned to the enterprise that

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,600
they're defending the business they're

187
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
defending

188
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
i also see when we talk about mind

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
shifts i also see

190
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,000
what i call the alert watcher mentality

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
and i think many security teams have

192
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
sort of started to grow beyond just

193
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
you know log and route watch up for

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
alerts escalate them when you see them

195
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
but i still see that mentality creeping

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
into daily operations in a lot of places

197
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
that i come into and that might not

198
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,919
always look like

199
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,560
hey something flashes red open a ticket

200
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
route it right maybe we're a little past

201
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,759
that

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,199
but even if we are i still see tools

203
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
and events and vendors driving workflow

204
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,000
much more than i see

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
security teams devising their own

206
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,039
workflow again

207
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
to meet the needs of the business and to

208
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,000
align with the the business or the

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,599
organization

210
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,840
and then making the tools support that

211
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
workflow and it's a really important

212
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
distinction one that i see

213
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
is not being made nearly as often as i'd

214
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
like to see it

215
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
we have the sustainment mentality in

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
security uh primarily in security

217
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
operations

218
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
is where i see this where we have a

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,919
build out phase and then we have ongoing

220
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,880
operations

221
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
and once we've built everything out once

222
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,400
we've deployed all those nice fancy

223
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,120
tools

224
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
it really just comes down to keeping

225
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
those things going and sustainment

226
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,479
right we're just ongoing operations this

227
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,000
is a really dangerous mindset

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
it can lead to burnout it can lead to

229
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
kind of a lackadaisical approach

230
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
to security and it can prevent us from

231
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
growing and evolving the way

232
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,440
that we need to and then finally data

233
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
and tools

234
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,879
these are this is the currency of

235
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
blue team and security operations the

236
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
data that i have

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
you know the technology that i'm using

238
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
to manipulate to

239
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
analyze and to take action based on that

240
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,199
data so either

241
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,000
we have too much of that right a lot of

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
organizations i see

243
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
far too much data maybe it's not the

244
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,120
right kind of data in a lot of cases but

245
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
you know too much noise not enough

246
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
signal or maybe

247
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,319
you know too many tools or not enough

248
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,240
tools or not the right tools

249
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,759
right and while it's not all about

250
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
technology we do need a good balance of

251
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
the right kind of visibility the right

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
kind of actionable data

253
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
and the right technology to help us

254
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
scale our

255
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,719
human expertise be creative do what we

256
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,240
need to do from an investigative

257
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,399
and escalation standpoint so those are

258
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
some of the big

259
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,200
challenges that i see that we need to

260
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,320
overcome if we really want to level up

261
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,360
and improve so before we start talking

262
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
about ways that we can do that really

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
getting to the meat of it

264
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,680
i want you all to consider these things

265
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
because in my opinion

266
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
many of the pitfalls uh and and many of

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,640
the

268
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,080
um ways that you know we need to

269
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
overcome

270
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
some of the challenges and improve

271
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
security and improve

272
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
what we're doing on the blue team is it

273
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,000
comes down to one of these things

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
the mission either we're not as fully

275
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
aware of it as we should be we're not

276
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,839
supporting it the way that we should be

277
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
um not aware of of what our own role in

278
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
that larger mission is within the

279
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,279
business or with the your

280
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,360
within the organization how we're

281
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,839
leading our teams

282
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,240
how those teams are motivated or in some

283
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
cases not so motivated

284
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
it's going to make a huge difference and

285
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
then the culture will we're building

286
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,399
within the blue team

287
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,920
okay and i'm going to dive into all of

288
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
these things in much more detail in the

289
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
next few minutes

290
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
but again by and large most of the

291
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
challenges the issues i see

292
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
in the blue teams that i work with come

293
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
down to one of these

294
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,800
things so when i talk about fundamentals

295
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
what am i really talking about we have

296
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,640
to get back to the basics right

297
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
and in order to do that we can start

298
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,640
with studying the business or the

299
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
mission

300
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
now you may be well aware of what your

301
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,959
enterprise

302
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
exists to do what your company your

303
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,160
agency

304
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
your organization you know what it does

305
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,279
kind of on the face

306
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
of it but are you really aware of

307
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,519
market forces competitors what are the

308
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,800
strategic plans

309
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,600
of that business right what are all the

310
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
different kinds of services that

311
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
you know your agency your organization

312
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,240
offers how does it create

313
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,279
value okay not only today

314
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,959
but in the next six months in the next

315
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,279
year the next five years

316
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
how is it going to create value how is

317
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,399
it going to change what are the other

318
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,440
external forces

319
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
that are going to impact that influence

320
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
it competitors

321
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,640
other parties that might be very

322
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
interested in hijacking or

323
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
reducing that value okay then you can

324
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,200
start thinking about what the real risks

325
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
are and where you should be prioritizing

326
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,560
your time and attention

327
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,279
we need to be ready to experiment and

328
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,720
iterate

329
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
now does that mean just throwing

330
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
anything at the wall and seeing what

331
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,399
sticks

332
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,519
no not necessarily but remember i talked

333
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
about that sustainment mentality you

334
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,240
know just sitting there

335
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,839
standing a watch we need to do

336
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,600
everything we can to break out of that

337
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,880
as often as we can

338
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
and be ready to grow and improve our

339
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,399
capabilities

340
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
right add new capabilities swap out

341
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
things that aren't working well

342
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
and iterate over time to make sure we're

343
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,079
continuously improving

344
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,360
incredibly important i

345
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
often talk especially with leadership

346
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
and executives about

347
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
servant leadership now when it comes

348
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
down to you know tactical leadership

349
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,240
day-to-day

350
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,519
security operations we need to be ready

351
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,399
to share

352
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
our knowledge we need to be ready to

353
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,680
empower others

354
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
to lift others up and help our teams

355
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
improve

356
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
and many times what i see in not only

357
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
security but in tech in general

358
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,959
we tend to hoard our expertise and hoard

359
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,240
our knowledge like it's some kind of

360
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,040
currency

361
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
that once we spend it we're never going

362
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
to get it back but the reality is we

363
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
need to be able to lift

364
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
others up right adopt that mentality of

365
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,639
servant leadership

366
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,079
and i think that's true whether you're a

367
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,160
manager or lead or

368
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,240
you know just uh one of the one member

369
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,680
of a larger team

370
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
that needs to help your teammates you

371
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
know do what they do better and enable

372
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
them we need to be prepared to show

373
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,839
results

374
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
and i'm talking about metrics and i'll

375
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,200
talk more about metrics in a few minutes

376
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
you know add transparency again

377
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
businesses do not exist to be secure

378
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
so everything that we do that is

379
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
important to us on a

380
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
day-to-day basis that might not be

381
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
something that resonates

382
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
with folks outside of the blue team and

383
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
we need to acknowledge that and

384
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
provide them with meaningful information

385
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,480
meaningful data

386
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
about what we're doing how well we're

387
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
doing it and then finally

388
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
we always need to have a plan okay

389
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
wherever you're going whatever your

390
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,519
strategy whatever your mission is

391
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
as a blue team right where are you going

392
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
to be in six months

393
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
where are you going to be in a year what

394
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
kind of improvements are you gonna make

395
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
between now and then very important to

396
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,920
do

397
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,079
so i've said mission probably about a

398
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
dozen times now let's talk about that

399
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
for a minute what is your mission

400
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,959
really in the blue team and the answer

401
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,519
is not

402
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,880
to manage my sim to monitor these events

403
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
to watch this email inbox right to

404
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
handle user requests

405
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,959
your mission as a blue team should be

406
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,040
defined in a

407
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
document some kind of written statement

408
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,079
somewhere

409
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
right we often call this a charter blue

410
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,480
team charter or security operations

411
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,120
charter

412
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
whatever it is it's something that

413
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
defines the mission your constituency

414
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,839
the folks the business units that you're

415
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,959
serving and

416
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,800
your capabilities what are you there to

417
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,160
do

418
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
every member of the team should be able

419
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
to describe this charter

420
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,000
with relatively little variance from

421
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,839
team member to team member

422
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
if you went to your team right now today

423
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,399
and asked what's our mission

424
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,160
right you might be surprised at some of

425
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
the differences and answers

426
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,519
that you would get so everyone needs to

427
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
be on the same page about that

428
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
many times it's helpful to have a

429
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,279
steering committee

430
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
which is a cross-functional group of

431
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
leaderships leadership

432
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
from all over the business or the

433
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,560
organization that's responsible for

434
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,519
setting direction for the security team

435
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,199
managing all the requirements

436
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,760
of the organization and ensuring that

437
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,880
different divisions

438
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,040
business functions stakeholders are

439
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,399
represented

440
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
in the blue team in the security

441
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
operations center if you have one

442
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
and that's a really good way to maintain

443
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
that kind of organizational alignment

444
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,160
that i talked about uh the steering

445
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
committee you know can also help answer

446
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,120
the question

447
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
to others in the organization you know

448
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,199
what are they doing

449
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,680
i never know what they're doing right we

450
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
never want to be asked that question we

451
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
want everybody to understand the value

452
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
of what we do

453
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
that cross-functional steering committee

454
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,920
can be very handy in doing that

455
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,040
now let's talk about team for a minute i

456
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,199
often describe security teams as falling

457
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,320
into one of two buckets from a staffing

458
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,639
perspective and people whether you

459
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
realize it or not are by far the most

460
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
important part of any security team

461
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
okay so i look at it as a spectrum

462
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
maybe not necessarily buckets but a

463
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
spectrum and on one end we have

464
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
talent-centric teams

465
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,760
these are teams that i've been a part of

466
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
or that i've seen

467
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,120
where everyone kind of rallies around

468
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,279
one specific individual or maybe a few

469
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,399
key individuals

470
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
that really set the tone for the group

471
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
they set operational priorities

472
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
uh they set you know focus hey here's

473
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,040
what we're working on today

474
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,639
here's how what you do if you see this

475
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,079
event firing

476
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,199
here's why we need this technology um

477
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,120
you know these are teams where again

478
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
you've got one or a few key individuals

479
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
that are really driving

480
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
the whole operation and on which the

481
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
whole operation is very

482
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,360
reliant on the other end of the spectrum

483
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
we have a mission-centric team

484
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,800
this is where uh the blue team might be

485
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
governed by

486
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
you know some larger governing body

487
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
within the organization or maybe a

488
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
contract i see this a lot

489
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,120
in government contracts where you have

490
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
very specifically laid out here are the

491
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
things that the team must do there's no

492
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,399
room for

493
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
experimentation or deviation from that

494
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
scope

495
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,199
and there's no right or wrong way to

496
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,360
staff the team

497
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,320
on a talent-centric team that might be a

498
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
great way to get a lot of capability

499
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,720
really fast

500
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,320
if you need to get spun up quickly right

501
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
get a lot of got a lot of wins right out

502
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,199
of the gate

503
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,959
but your capacity might be limited if

504
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,480
you're so reliant on

505
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
one or a few key individuals right

506
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,759
there's only so

507
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,240
much that that person or those people

508
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,120
can do

509
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
um bias in terms of what you're focused

510
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,160
on

511
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,399
right or how the team works turnover

512
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
those might be bigger problems

513
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
because again you're heavily reliant on

514
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
one or just a few

515
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,079
key individuals as opposed to kind of

516
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,920
leading and

517
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,639
driving things by consensus conversely

518
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,720
on a mission-centric team

519
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
that can be really great for

520
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,920
organizational alignment making sure

521
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,279
you're meeting all the needs of the

522
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,000
business or that management has set out

523
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
sometimes that brings less flexibility

524
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
and it can cause you to miss the force

525
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
for the trees sure you might be doing

526
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,319
everything that's in that contract

527
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
but are you really measurably reducing

528
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,919
risk

529
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,240
and reliably you know identifying

530
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,199
responding to

531
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,319
intrusions compromises things like that

532
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,720
so as you look at this i want you all to

533
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,760
think about

534
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
in your blue team are you more on the

535
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,679
talent-centric end of the spectrum or

536
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,320
are you more

537
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
on the mission mission-centric end of

538
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,879
the spectrum

539
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,280
i would be remiss in talking about

540
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,039
staffing if i didn't also talk about

541
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,440
what kinds of people we really want on

542
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,480
the team

543
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,280
and while many of you might not have

544
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,039
staffing you know decisions decision

545
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
making ability

546
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
it's helpful to understand you know when

547
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,760
we run into

548
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,280
collaboration challenges or

549
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,799
effectiveness challenges

550
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,400
a lot of times it comes down to

551
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,240
interpersonal issues

552
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,120
and to try to navigate and hopefully

553
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
avoid those or we can

554
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
we want to make sure we're attracting

555
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,880
the right kinds of folks and that means

556
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
attracting aptitude right the ability to

557
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,640
learn and grow one skill set the right

558
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
attitude which is the willingness to

559
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:14,880
learn

560
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
and grow one skill set to work as part

561
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
of a team to make sure the team is

562
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
successful

563
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,640
uh you know a desire to do the work

564
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
motivation

565
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,320
and above all else diversity okay and i

566
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,120
mean that

567
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
in every sense of the word your team is

568
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,039
not going to be as effective

569
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,600
as it should be without diverse

570
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,400
backgrounds

571
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,960
diverse ways of thinking right diverse

572
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,320
types of education

573
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,679
formal informal right diversity is key

574
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
diversity of thought is key

575
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,760
we want to avoid over-reliance on

576
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,679
credentials now again

577
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,760
i'm an instructor for sans i'm a huge

578
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
fan of formal

579
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,799
in-class training uh of certifications

580
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
those are great

581
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,919
where they stop being so great is where

582
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,840
we are over reliant on them

583
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
as a measure of someone's ability right

584
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
it is a good useful data point we don't

585
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
want to rely on them

586
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,679
too much in all circumstances we want to

587
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
watch out for egos

588
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
right putting oneself above the team or

589
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
the mission misrepresentation folks who

590
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,559
maybe aren't

591
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
quite as genuine as they should be when

592
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,679
it comes to their

593
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
skills abilities background experience

594
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
so things to watch out for

595
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,679
now i said that this talk is mostly not

596
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,679
about the technical portions of cyber

597
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,200
defense but i do want to touch on the

598
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
things that your team

599
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,039
absolutely has to have any discussion of

600
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,919
you know leveling up

601
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,919
doing advanced things right if you're

602
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,440
not doing these things right

603
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,760
you're not going to be successful

604
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,720
visibility

605
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
absolutely critical i think most of us

606
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
know that at this point if you're a blue

607
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
teamer by trade or if you've done any

608
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
kind of defensive work

609
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
you can't defend what you can't see so

610
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
we need access to

611
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,320
things like core services web email

612
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,880
dns right endpoint to endpoint

613
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,840
communications

614
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,159
we need network and endpoint data so we

615
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,520
can see the full picture of everything

616
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,039
that's going on in our environment you

617
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,240
know cloud data where

618
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
that's relevant and then

619
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
again from a technical perspective we

620
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,120
need to ask what is our team empowered

621
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,439
to do

622
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,159
in sec 450 we spend a lot of time

623
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,039
talking about this

624
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,880
virtuous cycle or this human capital

625
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
management model

626
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
where you have to empower technical

627
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,400
folks right and if they're empowered

628
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
then they're more likely to be creative

629
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
they're more likely to be effective

630
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,760
so are we empowered to respond to things

631
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,720
that we see

632
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
are we empowered to make changes to and

633
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,559
improve our telemetry

634
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,880
tune our tools right without that

635
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,919
empowerment

636
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,760
the team is really going to be hamstrung

637
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,280
in terms of things that

638
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
that it can do things that it's willing

639
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,440
to do and you know being able to level

640
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
up

641
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,039
we also want to measure our success

642
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,679
remember

643
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,080
we need to be able to tell our story to

644
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,720
individuals

645
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
outside of the blue team where the

646
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
technicalities of our work

647
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,960
might not resonate it might not motivate

648
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,039
them but telling the right story

649
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,120
with the right supporting data that is

650
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
very motivating

651
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,799
uh whether you're in security or not you

652
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
know to the right business leaders and

653
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
the right stakeholders

654
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,159
so most of you are probably familiar

655
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,240
with the phrase kpi or key performance

656
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,440
indicator

657
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
these are measurements of in our case

658
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
our security operations

659
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,320
on a day-to-day basis things like what

660
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,039
is our

661
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,679
coverage what's our visibility for our

662
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,320
security monitoring and response

663
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
how fast are we identifying and

664
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
responding to

665
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,240
security incidents right those are kpis

666
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,120
what are the

667
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,679
distribution of criticality of those

668
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,840
incidents things like that

669
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,679
what you may be less familiar with are

670
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
okrs which are

671
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,080
objectives and key results i believe

672
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
this originally came out of

673
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,679
intel several years ago under andy grove

674
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,000
who i i think pioneered the concept of

675
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
okrs if i'm not mistaken

676
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
but these are measures that are a little

677
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
bit higher level they tie

678
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
operations to strategy so remember i

679
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,960
talked about making sure your blue team

680
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,080
is aligned to the business

681
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
this is a great way to do that so think

682
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,919
about what the priorities of your

683
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,679
business or your organization are

684
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
maybe it's we're getting lit up by

685
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,240
social engineering attacks

686
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,360
right so one strategic objective that we

687
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,760
have

688
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,919
for the blue team is to reduce those

689
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
right or reduce their impact

690
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
now you can use okrs to bring kpis into

691
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
the desired range

692
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
right so thinking again about our

693
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
example of reducing social

694
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
engineering attacks okay there are

695
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,320
several key results that we have to see

696
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
in order to drive you know successful

697
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,240
social engineering attacks down

698
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,799
maybe it's faster better identification

699
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,280
of

700
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,480
phishing attacks right maybe it's

701
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
more advanced notification when someone

702
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,440
is trying to enumerate our users or you

703
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
know actively

704
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,840
do active reconnaissance of our

705
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,240
environment whatever it is

706
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,200
we've got kpis that help us identify

707
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
those key results

708
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
and we need to bring those into an

709
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
acceptable range maybe for social

710
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,559
engineering attacks

711
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,880
you know maybe it's zero highly unlikely

712
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
but but maybe that's our acceptable

713
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,960
range

714
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,600
so we can use okrs right to kind of

715
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
group these kpis together and

716
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
drive them to where we want them to be

717
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
over time this adds a little bit more of

718
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
a narrative

719
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
to your day-to-day kpis helps you tell a

720
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,600
better story so

721
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
i always tell my clients uh you know

722
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
look at if you're if you've got your

723
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,480
kpis

724
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,200
nailed down pretty well and you know you

725
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
want to start kind of

726
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,320
raising the bar slowly take a look at

727
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
adding okrs defining those

728
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,640
and using them to drive your kpis to

729
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
where

730
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
you want them to be

731
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,520
so again difference between kpis okrs

732
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
kpis or things

733
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,320
discrete measures of your operation

734
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,120
there's going to be

735
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
a threshold or a target value that you

736
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
want each

737
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,440
measure to be at there are going to be

738
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
specific data sources that you're going

739
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,520
to use

740
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,279
to get those kpis and there will be a

741
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,120
sampling frequency

742
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
right maybe your visibility and coverage

743
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,919
kpi is only measured on a monthly basis

744
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,760
or a quarterly basis

745
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
right but your incident response kpis

746
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
are going to be daily your monitoring

747
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,360
kpis you know might be daily hourly

748
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
what have you okrs they're more about

749
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,720
key initiatives

750
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
they're going to be finite in nature

751
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
there's a desired

752
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,840
kind of endpoint where you want to get

753
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
to that that key objective

754
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
and they're going to be results that you

755
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
need to see along the way

756
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
to tell you whether or not you're

757
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,159
getting to those okrs

758
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,240
so when we talk about leveling up you

759
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,400
know this is a big part

760
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
of making sure you're leveling up uh in

761
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,320
a

762
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
measurable way right in a transparent

763
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
way and not just saying yeah yeah we're

764
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,679
doing a lot better we're

765
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
we're blocking a lot more you know

766
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,279
attacks we're responding to things

767
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:49,919
faster

768
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,919
right this makes it a little bit more

769
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,360
scientific and

770
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,080
adds a bit more transparency another

771
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,799
part

772
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,240
of improving is taking an honest look

773
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,679
at how well you're doing what you're

774
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
doing in the form of structured

775
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
self-assessments for the blue team for

776
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,840
the security operations team

777
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,919
and there are lots of different types of

778
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,840
self assessments that you can do

779
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
uh there have been some really great uh

780
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,120
research

781
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
and writing done about this chris

782
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,960
sanders has done a lot about

783
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,120
you know metacognition and assessing

784
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,559
your work and kind of looking at what

785
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,679
you're doing

786
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,000
but i kind of group them into three

787
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,960
buckets

788
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
starting with the assessments that you

789
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,000
do prior to

790
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,720
the work that work might be an instant

791
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,360
response

792
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,640
it might be monitoring it might be

793
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,440
a project um i call these pre-mortems

794
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,559
right primor mortem as you may guess is

795
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,919
similar to postmortem

796
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,480
except you do it before the activity so

797
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,840
before a response

798
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,600
right before a tabletop exercise

799
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,039
whatever it is you want to do a

800
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,320
run-through of

801
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,520
that scenario right how you anticipate

802
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
the process working and you want to

803
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,279
identify inefficiencies

804
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,600
right ineffective tasks within that

805
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
process you know

806
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
groups or individuals that aren't

807
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,760
involved that maybe should be things

808
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
like that that helps you identify

809
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
issues proactively that you want to

810
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
address either during the process or

811
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,880
after

812
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,240
during the task again whether it's an ir

813
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,799
or you know other activity you want to

814
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
be doing qc all along the way quality

815
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,679
control

816
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,440
right and this could be anything from

817
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,960
having that kind of two sets of eyes

818
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
rule right i want someone supervising

819
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
what i'm doing to

820
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
you know having a lead or somebody

821
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
supervise

822
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,600
specific tasks like evidence collection

823
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
escalation right and doing

824
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,159
investigations closing out cases

825
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,679
things like that quality and control is

826
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,520
critically important i can't tell you

827
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,559
how many times

828
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,720
i've gone into a soccer blue team to do

829
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
an assessment

830
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,279
you ask for access to their ticking

831
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,440
system and you see so many

832
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,960
hours spent on tasks and investigations

833
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,679
that have gone off the rails didn't

834
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,400
reach

835
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,279
the right conclusions maybe it didn't go

836
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,679
well

837
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,120
and no one bothered to look at them

838
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
along the way no one bothered

839
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,760
to follow the process and do that qc

840
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,919
during and it's not until

841
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,520
you know much later that we're able to

842
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,440
identify those issues so

843
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,520
during the process qc very very

844
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,880
important and then you've got

845
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
postmortems

846
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,000
these are structured reviews of you know

847
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
things that have occurred let's take a

848
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,600
look at this uh incident let's take a

849
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,960
look at this investigation

850
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,919
these changes we made um this is very

851
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,039
very important

852
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,640
to take an honest look at what we're

853
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,320
doing

854
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,080
this is a great exercise doing a

855
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,559
postmortem

856
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,640
to do as part of a brown bag or a team

857
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,600
meeting you know

858
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
pick out a case pick it apart right

859
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,200
there are lots of different types of

860
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,480
postmortems you can do

861
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
you can do an a b test kind of thing

862
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,240
where maybe you take all the evidence

863
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,919
give it to another person or another

864
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,840
team have them go off see if they come

865
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
to the same conclusions or

866
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
follow the same path that the other team

867
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,320
that worked that case did for example

868
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,240
you can do more of a red teaming type

869
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,679
exercise where you just have folks kind

870
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,720
of pick apart

871
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,799
uh what was done this is not only a

872
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,240
great way to kind of build

873
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,960
team cohesion and identify opportunities

874
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,440
uh

875
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,360
for improvement it's a great way to

876
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
create this atmosphere of learning

877
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,880
right and kind of normalize mistakes

878
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,720
normalize failure and acceptance of

879
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,960
those things as

880
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
constructive you know opportunities for

881
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,399
improvement

882
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,679
so always recommend doing those

883
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,440
postmortems okay

884
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,440
watch out for these things so

885
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,600
we've got a i think a basic

886
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,799
understanding of some of the things that

887
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,000
we can do

888
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
to improve the efficacy of the blue team

889
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
start focusing on some of the right

890
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,520
things above and beyond doing that

891
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
technical work

892
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,960
but again we want to watch out for that

893
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
sustainment mentality that is a blue

894
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,840
team

895
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,520
killer and it is a productivity killer

896
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,240
okay how many of you listening to this

897
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
talk

898
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,000
show up for your shift on the sock or

899
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,279
the blue team

900
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,120
you know you kind of go through your

901
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
your playbook go through your processes

902
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
you go home at the end of the day and

903
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
you're really just not sure what kind of

904
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,480
measurable impact you've had

905
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,640
other than you know shoving some tickets

906
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,520
around

907
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
right closing out some alerts that is

908
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,960
not the way

909
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
defense should be we're stuck in that

910
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
sustainment mentality

911
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
we have to break out of that okay having

912
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
that steering committee

913
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
that includes folks that are not a part

914
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
of the blue team uh can help

915
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,559
us stay out of that making sure that

916
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,080
we're we're moving and growing and

917
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
evolving along

918
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,039
with the organization lack of trust

919
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,919
this is a huge one now there is a really

920
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,360
great study that was done not too long

921
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,760
ago

922
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
by the department of homeland security

923
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,159
in cooperation with a lot of other

924
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,000
organizations george mason university

925
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
dartmouth several other

926
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,080
research groups where

927
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,880
researchers studied um the impacts of

928
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
social maturity

929
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
in instant response teams and looked at

930
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,919
a lot of these kind of layer

931
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,360
issues like communications and

932
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
collaboration and sharing knowledge

933
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,399
lack of trust you know that is a big

934
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,679
issue that is another

935
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,399
blue team killer if you don't trust your

936
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,200
teammates

937
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
to be able to share knowledge with them

938
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
to provide them constructive feedback

939
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,399
and input

940
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
right to help them and arm them with

941
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
information they need to be successful

942
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
uh your team is not going to be

943
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,960
successful in any case where we've got

944
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,159
people working together

945
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,279
you're going to have conflicts you're

946
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,080
going to have disagreements these can be

947
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
fine they can even be really helpful as

948
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,919
long as they're constructed and we work

949
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,559
through them

950
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,679
constructively lack of empowerment

951
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,840
i already talked about that a little bit

952
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,679
right empowerment leads to

953
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,279
creativity you know how can we do this

954
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,720
better right

955
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,159
maybe i should go look for this threat

956
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,159
that i haven't seen in my tools but i

957
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:52,559
know

958
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,640
is likely to be in my environment right

959
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,799
we want our humans to be creative

960
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,080
because that's what humans do

961
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
best but they can't do that unless

962
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,840
they're empowered to do that they have

963
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,559
time

964
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,360
resources management support right to be

965
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,440
creative to try different things

966
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
if they can do that guess what they're

967
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,760
gonna make improvements

968
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,200
in how effective the blue team is so

969
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
creativity leads to impacts positives

970
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,360
you know uh efficacy and

971
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,799
uh you know it's just kind of this

972
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,360
ongoing cycle right more empowerment

973
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,159
leads to uh better impact the inverse is

974
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:28,880
also true

975
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,279
right that we all can turn the other way

976
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,080
as well

977
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
if you're restricted and you may have

978
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,679
experienced this in the past

979
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
or maybe you're experiencing it right

980
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
now if you're not empowered to do things

981
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,039
you're probably going to be less

982
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,120
motivated to try to be creative and make

983
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,080
improvements

984
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
and the performance of the blue team is

985
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,559
going to suffer for that

986
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,880
and then finally role oriented bias now

987
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,600
listen

988
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,200
i know no one in this talk has ever done

989
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,159
this

990
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,000
right but maybe other people that are

991
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
not on this talk you know definitely are

992
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,720
out there where

993
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,760
you know hey i am a forensic analyst

994
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,399
right and i'm very focused on that and

995
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,000
that's great

996
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,399
challenges come in where if i'm a

997
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,000
forensic analyst and suddenly

998
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,120
everything i do every ir i see every

999
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,640
investigation

1000
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,559
right one of my first stops is well

1001
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,480
gotta get a disc image

1002
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
gotta dump the memory right sometimes

1003
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
that is the right place sometimes it may

1004
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,039
not be

1005
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,279
my point is not that you know forensics

1006
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
shouldn't be a focus my point is that

1007
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,200
uh sometimes you know when all you have

1008
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,640
is a hammer everything

1009
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,039
uh suddenly looks like a nail and we

1010
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,240
want to try to keep

1011
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,720
you know our focus somewhat broad it's

1012
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,399
great to specialize and in fact

1013
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,880
i always tell you know my students that

1014
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,600
you want to specialize in one or a few

1015
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,919
areas but we have to keep our outlook

1016
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,519
broad and understand that maybe our

1017
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,120
specific focus or skill set

1018
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,360
may not always be the right fit for

1019
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,159
whatever problem

1020
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,880
set i'm currently working so task

1021
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
shifting

1022
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,000
right doing some of that post-mortem

1023
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
activity where we talk about kind of our

1024
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,640
different perspectives

1025
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
our different roles in an investigation

1026
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
things that we might have done

1027
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,679
differently

1028
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
this kind of communication and again

1029
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,799
kind of rotating folks

1030
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,559
through different roles different tasks

1031
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
can kind of help us keep that broader

1032
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,679
focus

1033
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,000
that broader awareness and understand

1034
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,960
that

1035
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,720
know while we may specialize in various

1036
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,000
things within the blue team

1037
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,159
you know sometimes our skill sets may

1038
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,679
not be the right skill set for the job

1039
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,039
or maybe

1040
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,799
we need to engage other teammates you

1041
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,080
know kind of help us

1042
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,399
uh solve a problem you know or address

1043
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,200
something that we're

1044
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,559
trying to do stay out of that role

1045
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,360
oriented bias

1046
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,840
and now again i'm going to take a few

1047
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,720
minutes

1048
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,320
and talk about things that i personally

1049
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
have failed at

1050
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,559
one of my favorite business books is the

1051
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,000
hard thing about hard things

1052
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,039
by ben horowitz and uh this book is

1053
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,720
is more of an executive book it's about

1054
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
his experiences

1055
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
as a manager and a ceo and a leader

1056
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
in various internet startups so it's

1057
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,960
definitely you know

1058
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,720
management executive focused it's not

1059
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
security focused

1060
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
but the reason this book is one of my

1061
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,079
favorite business books is that

1062
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
ben talks almost exclusively about

1063
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,440
things that he has tried

1064
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
things that he encountered that maybe

1065
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,560
did not go great

1066
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,359
and what he learned from that and i

1067
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,280
found the book to be very refreshing

1068
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,359
uh in that sense and so i thought i'd

1069
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,480
take a page from that

1070
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,239
and kind of share some of the lessons

1071
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,079
that i've learned in my 19 years of

1072
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,800
experience

1073
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,399
building and leading blue teams so here

1074
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,199
we go and by the way this is just a very

1075
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,839
very

1076
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,040
short excerpt from a much larger list

1077
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,199
uh taking action when someone talented

1078
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,199
drags down team morale

1079
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,918
is a big one so again i know no one here

1080
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,599
right none of us we're all pretty locked

1081
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,760
on we're all very easy and pleasant

1082
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,918
and wonderful to work with but sometimes

1083
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,159
imagine this if you will in the security

1084
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
field you might have someone who's very

1085
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,480
talented

1086
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,520
very smart technically very capable

1087
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,599
right that does not really work well as

1088
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,200
part of a larger team

1089
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,040
right or maybe there's something off in

1090
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
the interpersonal dynamic

1091
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,680
okay and when this goes badly that can

1092
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,599
really damage the team it can bring down

1093
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,320
morale

1094
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,400
it can cause all sorts of other problems

1095
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
that have nothing to do with whether or

1096
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,480
not

1097
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
you know this particular individual has

1098
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,880
the skills or expertise

1099
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
needed for the job now i myself

1100
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,400
uh on more on one occasion in fact have

1101
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,680
you know failed to take appropriate

1102
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,480
action

1103
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,079
when this is happening you know things

1104
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,800
go sideways real quick

1105
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,480
uh when morale starts to go downhill and

1106
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,079
uh you know i've had these situations

1107
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
before where you know whether it's a

1108
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,520
lack of coaching

1109
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,640
a lack of direct and frank feedback

1110
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
to that individual and also

1111
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,000
understanding that

1112
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
there are some times where you need to

1113
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
have you know one set of rules

1114
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,800
for the team and maybe make allowances

1115
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
you know if someone just has a different

1116
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,359
way of working or they have different

1117
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,920
needs uh as a team member

1118
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
right that's okay where that stops being

1119
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,359
okay

1120
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,359
is where it starts damaging the team

1121
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,400
again kind of

1122
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,359
degrading the team's ability to do its

1123
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,000
job

1124
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
and the one take away from this that i

1125
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,440
would have is

1126
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,040
you know not that there is one right

1127
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
thing to do in every situation they're

1128
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
all going to be different

1129
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
but you have to take action and you have

1130
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
to take action swiftly

1131
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,000
it's very very important uh the second

1132
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,920
uh mistake that i have made and this is

1133
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,280
something that actually

1134
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,359
uh in in that book the hard thing about

1135
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,320
hard things

1136
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,359
um ben coins the phrase putting two in

1137
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,079
the box

1138
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,400
and in his example he talks about

1139
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,680
putting two people

1140
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,599
in an executive role that was meant for

1141
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,760
one but i personally have

1142
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,240
done this and seen it done in operations

1143
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,160
teams where you might have a lead

1144
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
or a manager or even the lead for a

1145
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
specific task or project

1146
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,599
and you don't want to alienate you know

1147
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,119
anyone on the team you might have more

1148
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,000
than one

1149
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
person who is right for that role or

1150
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,680
right for that task

1151
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,079
but in order to kind of not alienate

1152
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,960
people right

1153
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,920
in order to try to keep everyone happy

1154
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,599
you try to put more than one person

1155
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,440
in that set of responsibilities or in

1156
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
that role

1157
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
and i have found that that very rarely

1158
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
works it causes confusion about who

1159
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,839
people should go to

1160
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,320
especially if it's you know a lead for

1161
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,960
example

1162
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,240
or a manager on the security team um

1163
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
it causes confusion about who sets the

1164
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
tone you know who makes the decision who

1165
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
is ultimately responsible

1166
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,079
and again whether you're a manager

1167
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,160
whether you're a lead or not

1168
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,079
it helps to be able to identify you know

1169
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,200
this issue

1170
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,400
and whatever your org chart looks like

1171
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,240
within the team or within the blue team

1172
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,560
or

1173
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
the larger security organization you

1174
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,160
have to have those

1175
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,839
individuals that kind of drive things

1176
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,240
set the tone that have ultimate say uh

1177
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,440
in you know

1178
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
the technical task area or in what the

1179
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,119
team is doing

1180
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,400
the third one is big for me again i know

1181
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,680
definitely not an issue that any of you

1182
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,160
have had right

1183
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,040
sometimes in security and in tech in

1184
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,200
general we make the mistake of thinking

1185
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,640
because we have x experience or x

1186
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,760
technical knowledge

1187
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,920
we're smarter than our customer right

1188
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,599
when i say customer that might be your

1189
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,440
internal customer

1190
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,119
might be your external customer if

1191
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,480
you're at an mssp

1192
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
or a consultant whoever it is whoever

1193
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,040
you're working for

1194
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
never make the mistake of thinking that

1195
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,480
because you might be a sme

1196
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,320
because you might be a technical expert

1197
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,079
you know better than they

1198
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,640
you know what they need so a lot of this

1199
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
comes back to just

1200
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,880
being a good listener listening to your

1201
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,599
internal users your stakeholders your

1202
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,920
management your users

1203
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
your job is to enable them to do what

1204
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,000
they do securely

1205
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,480
so while there may be a fair amount of

1206
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
bellyaching and complaining about

1207
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,839
security right because we have to strike

1208
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,000
that balance we can't let

1209
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
uh you know everything go right um

1210
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,880
we have to listen we have to understand

1211
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
that you know the problems we're trying

1212
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,000
to solve the things that we're focused

1213
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,640
on

1214
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
not necessarily the things that uh

1215
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,240
someone else might be focused on and we

1216
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,000
have to

1217
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,880
be open to that

1218
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,400
shoving a technical solution down

1219
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,200
someone's throat as a lead as a manager

1220
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,359
i have definitely done this how many of

1221
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,000
you

1222
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,119
is a rhetorical question have a pet

1223
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,760
project

1224
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,680
a favorite tool something that you

1225
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,119
really really like you don't have to be

1226
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:31,760
a manager

1227
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,599
right maybe you just have a preferred

1228
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
thing and you want everybody to use that

1229
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,359
thing because it's so great and have you

1230
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,520
seen this feature and it does this and i

1231
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,560
just love when

1232
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
you know i'm an investigation and i can

1233
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,760
just click click click and it does that

1234
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,720
right

1235
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,520
whatever it is blue team is a team sport

1236
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
if more than when people are using a

1237
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,480
technical solution it has to be someone

1238
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,119
that work

1239
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,839
something that works for everyone uh and

1240
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:56,560
again

1241
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,800
whether you're a manager or not uh keep

1242
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,920
in mind that you know

1243
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,480
your favorite thing your favorite focus

1244
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
area your favorite tool

1245
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,720
might not work for everyone and we need

1246
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,000
to be cognizant of that

1247
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,520
i certainly do providing feedback on a

1248
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,960
consistent basis

1249
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,079
okay so again this is not just for

1250
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,760
blue teamers who are managers or leads

1251
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,359
right we have to be able to provide

1252
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,760
frank honest constructive

1253
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,960
feedback to other folks on the team on a

1254
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,000
consistent basis

1255
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
if we're not doing that for not having

1256
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,520
that conversation

1257
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
we're not going to be as comfortable

1258
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,640
with failure

1259
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,319
we're not going to be able to improve we

1260
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,839
might not even know how we need to

1261
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,680
improve

1262
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,359
so providing that constant feedback is

1263
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,359
really important you can't just assume

1264
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,040
because someone maybe is really good at

1265
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,839
their job

1266
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,920
or things are just kind of humming along

1267
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
like they should be

1268
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,200
you can't assume that that feedback is

1269
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,280
still not needed and that's kind of

1270
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,119
certainly been my mistake in the past

1271
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,640
right no matter how things are going

1272
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
you have to have that open communication

1273
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,680
you have to have that feedback

1274
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,079
okay this concludes the section on

1275
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,800
things

1276
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,200
that i have failed at let's move on to

1277
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,240
things that you can do

1278
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,760
today um when you leave this

1279
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,280
virtual conference when you leave this

1280
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,440
talk right next week when you're back in

1281
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,119
your virtual office

1282
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,599
um go schedule one-on-ones if you're on

1283
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,319
a team

1284
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,160
schedule one-on-one with your manager if

1285
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,839
you don't already have them scheduled

1286
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,920
if you're a lead or a manager schedule

1287
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,839
one-on-one with your team members

1288
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,640
this is a super basic thing super basic

1289
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,760
management thing

1290
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,040
a lot of technical teams still do not do

1291
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,720
so having something on the calendar kind

1292
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,640
of forces you to have that feedback

1293
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,160
forces you to have that conversation

1294
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,680
it's a good idea no matter what

1295
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,000
pull your team ask them to discuss the

1296
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,839
sock charter and what exactly they are

1297
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,280
protecting you can have a lot of fun

1298
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,000
with this

1299
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
doing uh you know a slack poll or

1300
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,400
things like that right get the

1301
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,160
discussion going see what the answers

1302
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,400
are

1303
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,680
make sure everyone is on the same page

1304
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,200
look for ways to remove barriers to

1305
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,240
communications and teamwork okay listen

1306
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,040
this is a big one really really big one

1307
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,599
so

1308
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,960
if you've been you know playing the new

1309
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,599
avengers video game uh on the side or

1310
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,200
like watching netflix or checking your

1311
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,960
phone while i'm talking i want you all

1312
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,359
to

1313
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,800
stop now and listen to this because this

1314
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,319
is a big one now

1315
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,359
uh that we're on what going on day 200

1316
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,760
some odd of quarantine so a lot of us

1317
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,400
are remote

1318
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,079
a lot of us are distributed whereas

1319
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,839
maybe we weren't before

1320
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,319
um increasingly blue teams are

1321
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,640
distributed anyway

1322
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,560
so we need to work that much harder to

1323
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,480
remove barriers to communication

1324
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,839
a big one being isolation and separation

1325
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,359
from each other

1326
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,960
excuse me and look for ways to work

1327
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,640
together as a team

1328
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,560
so a lot of us have collaboration tools

1329
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,280
a lot of us are doing meetings over zoom

1330
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,640
you might be feeling a lot of zoom

1331
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,200
fatigue

1332
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,359
at this point but using some of those

1333
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,680
tools to build social connections

1334
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,359
and that doesn't just mean hey you have

1335
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,560
to go share a bunch of personal

1336
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,200
information

1337
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,560
about yourself with people maybe that's

1338
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
not your thing right

1339
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
but you know look for ways that you can

1340
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,040
have conversations about

1341
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,280
non-tactical day-to-day topics right

1342
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,119
set up some slack channels for maybe

1343
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,200
non-work related things that

1344
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,680
are of interest to large parts of the

1345
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,480
group

1346
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,839
um it really takes a proactive effort

1347
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,760
to continuously break down those

1348
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,800
barriers to foster teamwork uh i find

1349
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,160
that you know trying to put people

1350
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,319
together in social situations

1351
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,640
again even if that's just hey let's just

1352
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,079
get together and have

1353
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
uh you know a chat at the end of the day

1354
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
about whatever you all want

1355
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,040
right even if it's that um that can

1356
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,680
really help

1357
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,079
improve cohesion and help make you more

1358
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:44,880
effective

1359
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,920
as a team go out next week

1360
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,640
set up a pre-briefing pre-mortem or a

1361
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,920
postmortem

1362
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,520
right following on to my last point

1363
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
if you're at a loss for what you can

1364
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,280
talk about in your next virtual zoom

1365
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,000
meeting

1366
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,920
right you've done all of the virtual

1367
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,319
exercises and happy hours and you know

1368
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,079
crazy hat days that

1369
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,839
you can think of go pick out an

1370
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,079
investigation pick out an ir

1371
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,400
and pull it apart do a post-mortem what

1372
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,160
worked what didn't work

1373
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,599
right what was everyone's experience

1374
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,599
kind of going through that uh

1375
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,280
opportunities for improvement it's a

1376
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
great team building activity

1377
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,599
and then pop quiz also rhetorical

1378
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,200
because of course this is

1379
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
uh pre-recorded but i'm happy to hear

1380
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,880
your responses

1381
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,599
uh and discussion in the slack i'm sorry

1382
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,200
in the discord channel oops

1383
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,800
um pop quiz is your team talent centric

1384
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,160
or is it mission-centric what part of

1385
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,839
the spectrum do you fall on

1386
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,800
is that the right end of the spectrum uh

1387
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,760
thoughts about

1388
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,359
you know shifting that a little bit do

1389
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,119
you need to shift it or is it the right

1390
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,000
fit

1391
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,079
for your blue team definitely something

1392
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,599
to think about

1393
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,400
what you can do tomorrow so i'm sure all

1394
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,920
of you are going to go out in the next

1395
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,839
48 hours you're gonna do all these

1396
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,440
things you're gonna be like mark i'm

1397
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,240
good to go

1398
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
i'm officially leveled up thanks moving

1399
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,880
on right what do you do after that

1400
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,760
um again look for ways to foster

1401
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,400
interaction

1402
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,440
social connections on an ongoing basis

1403
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,119
that's one thing that can die on the

1404
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,960
vine really fast if you're not caring

1405
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,760
for it

1406
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,480
so you know especially these days right

1407
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,319
think of ways that you can foster

1408
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,640
social interactions social connections

1409
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,079
within your team

1410
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,200
can really make a huge impact

1411
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,920
set some clear goals roles and standards

1412
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,480
for how

1413
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,280
the team operates how people are going

1414
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,520
to progress in their careers

1415
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
you don't have to be a manager or a lead

1416
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,280
to do that right

1417
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,119
if you're an individual contributor or

1418
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,319
part of a larger team

1419
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,960
you should have clear role description

1420
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,640
you should have clear goals

1421
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,040
and you should know the standards

1422
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,920
against which

1423
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,000
your performance is going to be measured

1424
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,599
and judged right

1425
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,839
if you don't have that guess what we can

1426
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,160
do to talk about that that's right

1427
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,240
one-on-ones right we can talk we

1428
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,760
communicate

1429
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,040
schedule those meetings exemplify

1430
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,359
communications norms that is a fancy way

1431
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,800
of saying

1432
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,440
be the change you want to see if all

1433
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,960
this sounds good to you if having a more

1434
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,599
collaborative

1435
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,520
environment of learning and continuous

1436
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,040
improvement if that sounds good

1437
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,160
guess what the change starts with you

1438
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,240
right exemplify that whether it's just

1439
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,520
and how you communicate

1440
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,800
in the team chat how you

1441
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,119
work and document that investigation and

1442
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,640
write be the example that you want to

1443
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,799
see

1444
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,480
we want to create a safe space a safe

1445
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,640
space right for failure

1446
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,319
and learning that doesn't mean we want

1447
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,279
to be failing all the time

1448
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,160
what we do is is high stakes right so

1449
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,920
failure is not the ideal but it's going

1450
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,040
to happen sometimes

1451
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,319
and it has to be something that we can

1452
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,640
look at honestly understand that

1453
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,960
everybody can fail um you know the

1454
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,319
question is how are we going to learn

1455
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,599
from it how are we going to

1456
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,440
improve as a result excuse me and then

1457
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,960
pushing the team out of their comfort

1458
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,680
zone so in that dhs george mason study

1459
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,040
that i mentioned

1460
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,400
this was a big one as far as you know

1461
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
how can we kind of keep teams learning

1462
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,839
keep them on the cutting edge and

1463
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,640
many studies have shown that keeping

1464
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,520
people

1465
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,079
on the edge of their knowledge of their

1466
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,599
comfort zone you know what they're used

1467
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,160
to doing

1468
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,920
is a great way to keep people learning

1469
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
to keep people motivated

1470
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,599
now we don't want to push people too far

1471
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,680
we don't want to toss them in the deep

1472
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,520
end on a daily basis make them feel

1473
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,480
overwhelmed and burnt out

1474
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,920
and we don't want to do it all the time

1475
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
okay but think about ways that

1476
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,240
either you as a part of a team or if

1477
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,760
you're a leader manager you know how you

1478
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,960
can push the team

1479
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,440
to the edge of their comfort zone on a

1480
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,359
regular basis right that's where

1481
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,559
we're going to learn the most and we're

1482
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,400
going to be able to improve the most

1483
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,160
whether that's you know hey we're going

1484
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,640
to extend our capabilities

1485
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,720
a little bit right we're going to maybe

1486
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,480
work with some new technology

1487
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
we're going to branch out into another

1488
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,079
part of the organization or the business

1489
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,200
that we're not especially familiar with

1490
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,480
we're gonna start working with another

1491
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,359
team

1492
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,960
right that we haven't worked with before

1493
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,640
those are all good ways to kind of push

1494
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,359
the team

1495
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,720
a little bit further than they might be

1496
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,359
useful than used to

1497
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,520
some other resources that i'll leave you

1498
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,400
with today

1499
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,240
of course i would be remiss if i didn't

1500
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,599
plug

1501
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,440
some of the classes that i work on with

1502
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,839
sans sec 450

1503
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,000
i didn't write this class john hubbard

1504
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,440
is the course author

1505
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,160
um john is a you know great blue team

1506
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,960
expert

1507
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,160
and the reason that i agreed to

1508
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,599
come on board with sans and start

1509
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,599
teaching this class is uh it really

1510
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,040
resonated with me

1511
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,240
um there's a big focus on

1512
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,280
you know what are the technical

1513
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,040
priorities of a blue team you know how

1514
