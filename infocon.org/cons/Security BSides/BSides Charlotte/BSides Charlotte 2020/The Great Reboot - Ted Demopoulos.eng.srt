1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,040
the great reboot how infosec

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,880
professionals can come out of this mess

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
better than before

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
on march 13th my life changed

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
i was at the red sea i was having a

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
great time i was working i was teaching

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,200
a class

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,199
but it was beautiful the weather was

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
gorgeous i was waking up early and

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,600
running by the palm trees in the ocean

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,920
there were great restaurants and amazing

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
seafood and every night i was going out

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
with a friend and having a great meal

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
i was taking vacation or holiday next in

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,519
jordan

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,600
i was gonna fly to oman i was gonna see

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
petra the scenes from raiders of the

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,880
lost ark

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
i was gonna go swim in the dead sea i

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,520
was really looking forward to this

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
instead there was an announcement that

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,719
we might be

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,399
closing the borders in the united states

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,039
i woke up at three in the morning i

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,960
didn't sleep very well i had a flight at

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,280
5

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
30. i didn't want to miss it the airport

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,680
was closing

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,000
i got to the airport i don't want to

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
exaggerate and say it was a full

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
refugee situation but there was luggage

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,520
abandoned in the street there were

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,159
people

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,600
sitting on the floor that looked like

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
they'd been there two or three days in

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,479
the airport

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,080
and i know a lot of flights had been

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
canceled

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
once i got through customs immigration

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,040
timing

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,759
ticketing all that stuff it was a little

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,080
calmer on the other side

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,159
but not exactly relaxed by any means

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
once i got on the plane and the wheels

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,520
took off

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,720
i breathed a sigh of relief sort of

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,439
two people in looked like full out

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,479
hazmat

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,640
suits there were nurses a male and a

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,520
female as

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,159
as the middle east came down taking

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,520
everyone's temperature

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,200
and i was like what if somebody has a

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,119
high temperature we're like already in

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,479
the air

56
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,439
i flew through istanbul great airport

57
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
very modern

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
very nice but it wasn't quite relaxed it

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,439
was sort of

60
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,920
very chill if nobody wanted to be there

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
i want to get through there and i was

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
thinking

63
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
what if my flight gets canceled they do

64
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,160
get cancelled

65
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760
the istanbul airport is in europe

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
and supposedly we're closing the borders

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,680
well i got on the plane

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
i did make it home won't even mention

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,920
what happened when i landed in boston

70
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,800
but

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,280
ninety percent of my work no longer

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
existed it had been postponed

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
cancelled or whatever on the flight home

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
i'm a consultant and just things stopped

75
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,959
and i love to travel it's a love of my

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
life it totally changed

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
and my life and the world became

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
a very different place with

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
lots of uncertainty going forwards

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,800
now who am i to talk about this well

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,519
i finished grad school in 86 got a job

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,840
working in technology

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
1990 i started working for myself

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,599
working in infosec

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,560
i was doing kerberos way back then a lot

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
of different clients ranging from a lot

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,159
of startups the fortune 500 to

88
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
government entities which gets me all

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
over the place

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,519
and i love to travel i've got three

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
books i've written more is coming up and

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
i've been through some tough times

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,800
before

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,920
the dot-com bubble bursting certainly 9

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
11 when also flights

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
stopped like they pretty much did now

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
2008 recession i even started my

98
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,440
consulting business

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,519
during a recession well

100
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
today is very different than any other

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
times like there's serious problems

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
going on right now

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,280
and whether we survive or do

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
well and so forth is a little iffy luck

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
does play a role i think

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
to a large extent we make our luck

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
no not entirely but we can do things to

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,959
maximize the probability of coming out

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,439
of this

110
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,560
hopefully better than before now this is

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
absolutely not a feel-good talk

112
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
we're going to talk about concrete

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,680
things you can do

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
to weather the pandemic and other

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,519
difficulties we have

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
and hopefully thrive both during and

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
afterwards

118
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
so what can you do to maximize the

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
probability

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
well preparation is obviously helpful

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,960
my biggest client they're doing all

122
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
right now

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
they're not doing as well as before but

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
they had actually planned

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,960
quite literally for a pandemic they had

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,840
thought

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,120
what if suddenly we can't travel anymore

128
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
what if people aren't moving around what

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
if they're not getting on planes

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
but we can't plan retroactively right so

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,479
we're going to be

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
looking primarily going forwards

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
now in some ways for some of us this

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,919
might be a chance for a fresh start

135
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,840
i'm looking at basically repositioning

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
redoing my business

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
changing some things as well as in my

138
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,199
life

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
and even people in companies in some

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
really hearted areas and industries are

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,000
doing well

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,840
not all my gym i loved my gym

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
small local friendly gym i got back

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
may 14th because flight was i don't know

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
30 hours with stopovers

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,280
and they sent an email fairly quickly

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,479
saying

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
hey we're still open you know we're

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
pretty empty

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
we're following the hygiene rules and

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
the cdc everything come on in

152
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,440
and i was like no way am i going there

153
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
well apparently everyone felt that way

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
in a little while longer there was an

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,720
email saying

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,039
our equipment's for sale don't worry we

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
won't charge you for this month

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:06:06,479
we're closed captioning not available

159
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,720
uh maybe i'm exaggerating maybe i'm

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
understating it but a lot of money

161
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
it doesn't take a lot of business class

162
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
tickets to the other side of the planet

163
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
to add up quickly

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
i've given them zero dollars since

165
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
march in fact last quarter their revenue

166
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,280
was down

167
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,319
90 percent but still

168
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
alaskan airlines added new routes

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
now they must have been planning this

170
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
ahead of time right but they didn't

171
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
cancel it they move forwards they must

172
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,240
be doing at least

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
okay in furniture right buying furniture

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,280
that's

175
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,840
furniture is not an essential service or

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,479
buying

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
furniture you can sleep on that old bed

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
or use that old couch

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
there's a chain in new england if you're

180
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
in new england you probably know them

181
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,240
jordan's furniture because they're very

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
colorful advertisements they opened a

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,160
store

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
right outside of portland maine the

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
biggest furniture store

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
in maine they actually opened it i think

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
it was august 3rd or

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,840
4th now obviously they must have been

189
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
planning that ahead of time but they

190
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,720
they carried on so

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
they must be doing okay

192
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
now i'd rather be an infosec

193
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
professional in the airline business

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
or the furniture business or a gym owner

195
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
or certainly like the hospitality

196
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
business restaurants or hotels or bars

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,440
some people say hey you know we're

198
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
uniquely poised

199
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
as infosec professionals yeah i don't

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
think so i think we're somewhere between

201
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
okay to great right we're better than

202
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
most

203
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
still some of us are unemployed just

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
today

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,440
i tweeted out three or

206
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,759
four different sets of job openings

207
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,199
because i know there's

208
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
some of us are unemployed we've been

209
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
laid off or furloughed or whatever

210
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
i already mentioned 90 of my work

211
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,319
disappeared overnight

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
yesterday i was talking to two friends

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
my friend chris his uncle passed away it

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
was definitely covered

215
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
another friend of mine his best friend

216
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
died now he was in his 80s but that

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,639
doesn't mean his life was worth any less

218
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,879
people are definitely dying who can't

219
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
downplay the seriousness it may be

220
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,919
much worse than we think maybe it's not

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
as bad

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
but just from very recently right talk

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
to anthony fauci

224
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
when you experience an outbreak don't

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,840
ever ever

226
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,360
underestimate the potential of the

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
pandemic

228
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,320
now people like to say we're all in the

229
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
same boat

230
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,279
yeah i don't believe that my boat's okay

231
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,599
my neighbor my direct neighbor similar

232
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,479
feel to us

233
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
his boat's not as good a little bit

234
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,760
older

235
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
he has pre-existing conditions he's not

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,839
in as good a boat

237
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,959
it might be the same storm but he has

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
a better chance of something bad

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,279
happening to him

240
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,600
than i do and a lot of you are probably

241
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
in better shape than me i'm in my 50s i

242
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,279
wish i was in my 30s i'd be less at risk

243
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
still whether we have something bad

244
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,640
going on or not

245
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
really have two choices two different

246
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
mindsets i can and i can't

247
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
and we could just sit around and say

248
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
this is bad i'm going to weather the

249
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,320
storm i want to do nothing if you have a

250
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
positive outlook saying you know

251
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
a good chance we could come out of this

252
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
better than before

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
positive thinking itself doesn't do

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
anything you have to do some good things

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
this requires planning and focused

256
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
effort emphasis

257
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,880
on focus knowing that some things aren't

258
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,680
going to go well

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,040
even in the best of times we're going to

260
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
have failures hopefully partial failures

261
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
along the way

262
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
now people many of my friends many of my

263
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,680
colleagues say well

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,560
it's impossible to come out of this

265
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
better than before

266
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
i can't do anything significant now

267
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,640
first of all you've probably done some

268
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
things that you

269
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,839
considered to be impossible at some

270
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,600
point and now you just do them all the

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,680
time it's not a big deal

272
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,640
very concrete example it used to be

273
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,040
thought

274
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
that for a human to run a mile in less

275
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
than four minutes was

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
physically impossible athletes thought

277
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
it coaches thought it

278
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
medical doctors thought it and so forth

279
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
then this guy named roger roger

280
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
bannister did it

281
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
supposedly impossible guess what lots of

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
people did it after him as soon as one

283
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
as soon as we knew it wasn't impossible

284
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
others did his record didn't last that

285
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
long about a month and a half

286
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,079
now it's been done by way over a

287
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,880
thousand people maybe up to 1500 now

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
including high school athletes that

289
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
aren't remotely near the peak

290
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,519
of their performance right it always

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,880
seems impossible

292
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,519
until it's done and i love that quote

293
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
from ford

294
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
it says whether you think you can or you

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
think you can't

296
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,040
you're right so let's talk about what

297
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
doesn't work

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
okay just dreaming okay

299
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
vague plans with no action now there's a

300
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,800
reason i have a picture of a piano there

301
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
i own a piano i inherited it now nobody

302
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
died just people were downsizing in the

303
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,680
family

304
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
i theoretically know how to play the

305
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
piano i can read music

306
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
i took lessons when i was a kid i came

307
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,040
back i'm like

308
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,760
i'm not traveling for a few weeks okay

309
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
it's turned into a few months but

310
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
i was like i'll just sit at the piano

311
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
every day i'll play for five or ten

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,240
minutes what

313
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,800
would i walk by i'll sit maybe when i

314
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
have my coffee in the morning or a drink

315
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
at night

316
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,079
a vague plan right no actual plan just

317
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,120
kind of vague and

318
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
i haven't sat once at the piano it's

319
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
about like the piano stool i just looked

320
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,519
today

321
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,839
it's still covered in can i say junk

322
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
crap i can't even sit at the piano with

323
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,000
all

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
the paperwork and stuff there uh i know

325
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,839
other friends

326
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,800
said well i'm gonna get in shape i'm not

327
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
commuting to work

328
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
good friend of mine used to drive 45

329
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
minutes each way

330
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,760
saving an hour and a half he's like i'll

331
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
just go for a walk every morning yeah he

332
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,360
hasn't done anything

333
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
right just vague plans just dreaming

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,760
doesn't do anything complaining

335
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,000
some of us have legitimate things to

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
complain about

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
i was sick this summer thought i had

338
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
covet turns out it was negative i just

339
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
had something else

340
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
i could have complained right of course

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
everyone's saying take care of yourself

342
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
get plenty of sleep stay hydrated it's

343
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
like yeah of course you should but

344
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,519
that's that's you know that's not going

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,600
to do anything in some ways i hate

346
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
positive thinking

347
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
because many people think that's all

348
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,959
that you need and positive thinking

349
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
alone doesn't do anything

350
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,519
you're going to do some actual good

351
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,399
things

352
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,800
to come out of this better you could

353
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
take a class

354
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,240
i have taken i think five classes

355
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,880
so far since that march flight home

356
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,680
i took two technical security classes

357
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
one was on risk management

358
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
one was chris crowley's security

359
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,399
operations center class

360
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
i took a class on professional

361
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
bartending with my son

362
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
i took a class on video production for

363
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,399
consultants and entrepreneurs i've taken

364
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
a bunch of classes some commercial

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
offerings

366
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,279
now this doesn't have to cost money some

367
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,480
of the conferences have

368
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,800
relatively cheap training i love

369
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
coursera

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,360
coursera has free training from

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
hundreds if not thousands of

372
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
universities worldwide

373
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
i took a great crypto class from

374
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,800
stanford i took another class from

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
princeton all in the last few years

376
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
mit open course where all of the classes

377
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,519
from the massachusetts institute of

378
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,160

379
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
are free all of them you to me

380
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
i've taken some great stuff from you to

381
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
me including some rock stars like uh

382
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,880
guy kawasaki and seth godin and they've

383
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,440
got

384
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,760
cheap classes and everything from wire

385
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
shark to

386
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
applying makeup

387
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
i could write a new class i teach a lot

388
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
you could write a class on something

389
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,160
you could learn a foreign language i'm

390
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
up to 183 days

391
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
solid i think on duolingo studying

392
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
spanish i was going to go in april

393
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
with chris crowley to oaxaca mexico on a

394
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,600
mezcal

395
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,079
tour that obviously didn't happen you'd

396
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,040
learn to cook

397
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,399
right study mixology i'm no joking i'm

398
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,880
in a serious study of tiki drinks these

399
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,519
days while i'm home

400
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,440
you'd learn to play the piano you'd

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
write a book or read a book

402
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
it's lots of possible good things you

403
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
can do there's only one problem you

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
can't do everything

405
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,560
you just can't you can't spread yourself

406
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,760
too thin that just doesn't work it's not

407
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
like a buffet where you want to eat a

408
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:53,839
little

409
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
this and a little of that and you'll end

410
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
up having eaten too much well in this

411
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
case you'll end up doing a little of

412
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
everything and really not accomplishing

413
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,199
much

414
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,240
since you can't do everything

415
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,199
i strongly suggest you have a not to-do

416
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,320
list

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,760
here's my list updated today

418
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,880
now i did write a new class but on my

419
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
list is

420
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,399
not to write another new class i really

421
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
want to write a class on

422
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
cryptography i'd love to run a five or

423
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
six day write a five or six day class

424
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,360
i've got the background i've got

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,639
advanced degrees in mathematics

426
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,959
but i'm not going to do it why because

427
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
it would take so much time and

428
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
can't do everything i've decided not to

429
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,759
learn to play that piano right now

430
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
uh later this fall maybe winter

431
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,079
when i'm inside or i may do it then but

432
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
it's on my not to-do list

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
getting in better shape i'm not doing

434
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
that

435
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
now i have lost about two and a half

436
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
stones over the last two years and

437
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,759
that's like

438
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,000
an obscure imperial measurement that

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
amuses me that's about 30

440
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,399
35 pounds i have lost 35 pounds i was

441
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,360
pretty big

442
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
i'm still big but i'm trying to maintain

443
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,720
my

444
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
this uh now i gave this talk

445
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,880
once before a month ago and people

446
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,639
really wanted me to run something

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,800
based on this on this talk some sort of

448
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
a challenge or a short class like

449
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,959
make people people people pay seven

450
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
dollars or 97

451
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
or 17 just so they're vested and have

452
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,959
people actually

453
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
come up with a plan and just go through

454
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
it as a group i love that idea

455
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,839
still a serious thought but i'm not

456
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,199
doing it right now because you can't do

457
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,120
everything

458
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,399
now i would suggest you come up with a

459
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,399
not to do list

460
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,800
these are things you want to do that

461
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,839
would be really

462
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,600
cool if you did but you're not doing

463
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,880
them at least not now

464
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,519
because you can't do everything now

465
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
don't put things on this list

466
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,600
that you're not that tempted to do so

467
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
not on my not to do list is to take a

468
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
class in ballet

469
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
i don't have a big desire in taking a

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
ballet class it would be pretty cool

471
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,400
i'm a big clumsy guy i'd probably end up

472
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,199
being less

473
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
clumsy and it'd be a really good thing

474
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
but there's no big temptation so i'm not

475
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
going to litter up my not to-do list

476
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,640
with that

477
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
i suggest you take no more than five

478
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,359
minutes just jot some things down

479
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,400
right do it two minutes it doesn't have

480
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,559
to be perfect

481
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,360
now let's talk about what worked earlier

482
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,000
in this

483
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
pandemic still does to some extent

484
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,799
a sprint a focused effort over a short

485
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,760
term

486
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
so i'm in this high-end business group

487
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
it's got a bunch of consultants like me

488
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
and other entrepreneurs and they had

489
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,679
these

490
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,240
17-day sprints now why they came up with

491
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,919
17 days i don't know

492
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
there's probably some back story and

493
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
we'd all pick something

494
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,679
we're gonna work on intensively for 17

495
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,880
days that would be

496
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,760
something seriously good to get done so

497
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,320
i did a very significant update to my

498
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
successful infosec consulting class i

499
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,679
worked on it every

500
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,080
every day for 17 days i think it was 15

501
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,960
days when i was done

502
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,760
a couple days of proofreading i love to

503
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,480
read

504
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,080
i don't read that much and i like to

505
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
read physical books when i was home in

506
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,880
the beginning

507
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,360
i was reading a minimum of two books a

508
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,320
week

509
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
i got a stack of books to go through it

510
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,840
i like physical books

511
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
friend of mine lives about 30 minutes

512
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
away he enhanced his home lab

513
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
and he played in it every single night

514
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,600
for two weeks

515
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,320
he still does just not every single

516
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,120
night

517
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
he actually took the free webinar it's

518
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,520
uh it's online now for black hills

519
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
information security on building a home

520
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
lab and he enhances

521
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,440
now sprint's work right there's some

522
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
current ones going on

523
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
friends from my firm former gym when it

524
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,960
shut down this august they started to

525
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
get fit in august challenge

526
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,520
you had to commit to showing up at least

527
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,799
two days a week

528
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
they're doing it five days a week

529
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,760
outdoors very socially distanced

530
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,200
worked so well they're doing it again in

531
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
september i didn't join

532
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,600
because i was busy doing other stuff i'm

533
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
a big james altucher fan

534
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
he's kind of a crazy man uh google his

535
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,520
podcast

536
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,240
two recent fridays he's had a 30 day

537
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
write a book challenge

538
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
and turn it you can't write a book in 30

539
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,280
days

540
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,280
well he convinced me you can

541
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,600
you can actually get a published book in

542
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
30 days

543
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
a guy named russell brunson he's a

544
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
marketing guy you probably don't know

545
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,679
him he's got a 30-day

546
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,160
funnel hacking challenge right so you

547
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,960
can do some

548
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
things in short periods of time but

549
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,840
we're not in a sprint anymore when i

550
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,039
came back

551
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,320
march 13th i didn't still expect

552
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,400
things bad things to be going on in

553
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
september

554
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,000
right a marathon requires a lot more

555
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
planning whether it's an

556
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
actual literal running marathon

557
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,240
or more of a you know more of a

558
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,640
metaphoric marathon now i ran an actual

559
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
marathon once a little over a year ago

560
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
it required planning right i trained for

561
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,679
months and months and

562
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,559
during the marathon there was a lot of

563
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,120
planning

564
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,000
going on as well where i was going to

565
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
stop for water where i was going to

566
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,039
run faster slower and i actually able to

567
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
finish this thing

568
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
but you can certainly get more

569
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
significant new things accomplished in a

570
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,000
longer time frame

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,320
than just a few weeks and if you're

572
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,159
trying to work at sprint pace

573
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
for months you're going to burn yourself

574
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
out

575
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
now just some working definition short

576
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
term maybe now to maybe a few months out

577
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,400
long term six months maybe decades for

578
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,760
me i define long term is 18 plus months

579
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
whatever definition works for you

580
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
now i love these quotes from winston

581
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,039
churchill

582
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,240
right plans are worthless planning is

583
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,600
priceless

584
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
it is the planning process that's

585
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,039
important

586
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,360
the plan is not going to work the way

587
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,640
you do it

588
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
there's various sayings it but no plan

589
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
survives contact with the enemy or no

590
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,559
plan survives contact with

591
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,679
reality you got to be flexible

592
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,679
i've come up with an actual plan and i'm

593
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,600
going to talk about

594
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
creating an actual plan

595
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
to come out better than before

596
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
i think you should create an actual plan

597
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
as well

598
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
now planning's not hard i've always been

599
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
a horrible planner

600
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,559
i just haven't planned i've just kind of

601
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,760
go with the flow and

602
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
it's worked well for me uh it's

603
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,679
interesting because

604
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,080
i've done lots of planning for others

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,840
professionally for a long time

606
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
i do a lot of strategic security

607
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
planning for my clients so

608
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,039
i am a good planner i just never did it

609
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,440
my

610
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,799
personal life well as soon as i had kids

611
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
i had to do more planning

612
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
and my ex-wife requires planning as well

613
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,760
right just make to make everything work

614
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
and i've always didn't want to plan in

615
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
my personal life because i'm like yeah

616
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
it's just going to like remove freedom

617
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
it's i just like to have flexibility

618
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,400
i've decided planning actually creates

619
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
freedom it gives us some structure

620
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
within that structure you have a lot of

621
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
freedom and you can change that

622
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
structure

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
right because because you're in charge

624
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,320
because things will change and evolve

625
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,480
and i honestly believe planning

626
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
helps you to see possibilities you might

627
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
not have otherwise

628
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,039
now when we're talking about planning

629
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,240
we're talking about the

630
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,360
future right we need to know where we

631
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
are now or reasonable

632
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
assessment the past matters to some

633
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,640
extent how you got to where you are

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,559
and you know companies will have a

635
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,320
so-called vision

636
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,799
a big picture call for a company

637
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,080
sometimes their vision is

638
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,840
we might describe it as what they want

639
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,000
to be when they grow up

640
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,559
whether you use the term vision or

641
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,919
long-term goal or

642
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
big picture goal i think we should as

643
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,760
well just like

644
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
companies do now realize you may have a

645
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
vision

646
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
and the further out that vision is that

647
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,799
thing you want to do or accomplish or

648
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,440
move towards the further out it is the

649
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
fuzzier things can become

650
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
right the less sure we are about the

651
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,640
future the further out it is

652
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,280
and so i'd like to say there isn't

653
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
really one future there's

654
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,919
all these possible futures and you might

655
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,480
say this is what i want to do

656
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,080
something else may happen there may be

657
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
some alternate future that happens it

658
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
might even be better

659
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,559
might just be different right there's

660
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,840
uncertainty when we go out

661
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
now the one thing people don't talk

662
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
about is the past is fuzzy too

663
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,279
at the past matters further back you go

664
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,880
the less certain the past is

665
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,159
i know what i had for lunch yesterday

666
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,200
three weeks ago i'm not so sure we're

667
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
pretty sure george washington had wooden

668
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
teeth

669
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
right pretty sure but did

670
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
genghis khan have teeth i don't know all

671
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,760
right the further back you go the

672
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
fuzzier things

673
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,679
are so here's what we're going to look

674
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,799
at

675
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,400
first of all the past not that far back

676
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,799
assessing where we were pre-covered

677
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,000
assessing as well

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,440
as we can because there's a lot of

679
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
uncertainty where we are now

680
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,200
a very small number a big

681
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,320
picture or longer term goals or vision

682
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,919
if you like that word some people like

683
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
that term some don't

684
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
now this isn't the bucket list this

685
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,919
isn't i want to go on a safari in south

686
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,880
africa

687
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,279
and i want to go bungee jumping and i

688
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,360
want no no no just a few things

689
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,320
not like a bucket list and some smaller

690
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,760
supporting goals

691
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,480
now the smaller supporting goals doesn't

692
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,159
matter if they succeed or not they're

693
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,200
only there to support our big picture or

694
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,120
longer term goals

695
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,000
and the temptation even if you restrict

696
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
yourself to a small

697
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
number of big picture goals and put all

698
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,760
these smaller supporting goals in

699
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,799
all these possible things remember the

700
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
concept of the not to do list

701
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,559
as well as your actual not to do you

702
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,559
can't do everything

703
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
and some planning tips for success or

704
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,799
for let's say avoiding failure if we

705
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,520
don't want to

706
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,360
planning for success is positive

707
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
avoiding failure i think that's also

708
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,559
positive it doesn't sound it so

709
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,159
i can't tell you about you but i can

710
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,320
tell you about me okay

711
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
march 12th that's when i changed my

712
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
flight to fly back the next day

713
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,159
right before the world suddenly changed

714
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,880
i had a really good and stable income

715
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,279
i wasn't making a million dollars a year

716
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,720
i was doing fine

717
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,440
i love what i do and i work hard and we

718
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,679
get paid pretty well in this field

719
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,080
i had a great lifestyle that i really

720
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,440
enjoyed

721
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,480
i love teaching i love consulting

722
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
i was doing a lot of this my favorite

723
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,279
places in the world

724
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,840
probably at least right now amsterdam

725
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
they know me in more bars in amsterdam

726
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
than anywhere else by name

727
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,279
brussels i love brussels and i'm a greek

728
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,240
origin

729
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,320
went to greece twice last year fallen in

730
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
love with greece i'd be going back this

731
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,640
fall

732
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
if things were different and i was

733
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
spending weeks

734
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,640
in these three places and generally

735
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
working there too and getting paid and

736
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,840
taking time off

737
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
i was seeing my family a lot families

738
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,799
important to me more would have been

739
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,240
better

740
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
uh more is difficult sometimes

741
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,320
especially with teenagers

742
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,080
i had lots of flexibility and freedom

743
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,720
so where am i now well there's lots of

744
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,159
uncertainty

745
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,880
my income's recovered i don't have work

746
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
lined up nine months out

747
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,480
uh i have guaranteed paid work

748
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,760
into well into next month that's it

749
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
i have plans in september excuse me

750
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,440
december and january they're not

751
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,799
concrete

752
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,840
i have a very different lifestyle right

753
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,960
uh almost all work is remote i had one

754
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,600
in person meeting that was not too far

755
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,039
away

756
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,080
um spending time two different places

757
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,360
new hampshire and maine two

758
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
i'm kind of multi-home you can drive

759
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
between the two places a lot less

760
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,960
flexibility and freedom

761
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,799
i had a long weekend off with a friend

762
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,480
we're like what are we gonna do

763
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,679
i was gonna go somewhere with my

764
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,960
girlfriends like what are we gonna do i

765
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,080
want to go to quebec

766
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,520
city guess what the border is closed

767
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,320
there's not that much flexibility

768
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,840
i both more time because i'm not

769
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
traveling also less time

770
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
i got three teenagers at home or let's

771
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
say two and a half

772
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,399
teenagers at home

773
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,399
so how would you summarize your life and

774
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,080
work pre-covert

775
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,799
and your life and work today now don't

776
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
spend a lot of time on this

777
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
i would suggest two three minutes no

778
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,480
more than five just

779
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,760
put something down the attempt is not to

780
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
be perfect

781
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
right you can go back and change this

782
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,919
afterwards and prove it

783
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,000
so i'm going to talk about my big

784
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,720
picture goals in coming up with some for

785
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,919
you

786
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,200
so the first one and

787
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,320
the first one is professional i do a lot

788
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,760
of teaching

789
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,399
i enjoy teaching i enjoy teaching

790
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:34,960
because

791
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
i found i think i'm providing the most

792
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,320
value doing teaching i still do some

793
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,039
pretty you know down and dirty hands-on

794
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,000
technical work for

795
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,279
sure as well some of my teaching is very

796
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,159
technical as well i'm focusing more on

797
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,919
my consulting and entrepreneurial

798
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,480
classes in infosec

799
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,360
and i want to teach primarily my own

800
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,559
classes

801
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,679
now the last time

802
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
uh i know i'm remote now but the last

803
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,240
time i was physically there i was

804
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,720
teaching classes for the sands institute

805
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,399
and i love their classes and i love

806
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,480
teaching them but i want to teach

807
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,679
primarily my own

808
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,039
i don't want to stop doing what i'm

809
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
doing i just want to do a little less of

810
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,159
it

811
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,679
so that's one big picture goal

812
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,520
okay how am i going to accomplish that

813
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,360
what are my

814
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,559
lower level supporting goals well i've

815
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,440
got a team redesigning my website

816
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,520
and a new one going up now which i'm

817
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
doing video a week

818
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,080
ah this should already be done i've

819
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,240
outsourced this but things often take

820
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,799
longer than we planned

821
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,000
running my infosec consulting class soon

822
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
i i've run it once i'm probably going to

823
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
be running it again soon

824
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,039
i just finished a solid first draft of

825
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,480
my next book

826
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640
tentatively called infosec consulting

827
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,760
101 but guess what it's just too big

828
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,120
so it's probably going to be more than

829
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,399
one book also i'm pretty sure i want to

830
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,520
run a virtual conference this fall

831
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
on consulting in entrepreneurism or

832
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,640
entrepreneurship in infosec

833
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
and my plan is i think it's gonna be

834
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,720
totally free to attend maybe a small fee

835
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
for recordings of sessions because it's

836
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,360
gonna cost me

837
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,799
some money to pull this off so these are

838
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,200
some of my supporting goals

839
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,840
i want to continue to do my work with

840
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,039
sans including

841
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,120
running my consulting classes with a we

842
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,159
pull those

843
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,840
joint decision because of the pandemic

844
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,320
right now i'm submitting some of my

845
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,480
classes including my consulting classes

846
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,919
to conferences

847
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,200
supposed to be teaching one of my

848
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
classes with the isc squared security

849
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,480
congress

850
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,039
uh which is is it next month or is it

851
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,000
november

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
i'm not sure i'm not doing that because

853
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
they've really scaled

854
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
back we're talking about the next year

855
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,360
i'm going to be submitting to the wild

856
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,720
west hacking fest

857
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,559
i've got good friends there so hopefully

858
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,840
they'll take that

859
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,080
brew con in brussels that one's

860
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,840
difficult because i have good friends

861
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,080
there and they see my names on something

862
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
they recuse themselves and people never

863
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
heard me look at it

864
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,440
black hat's a possibility it's a long

865
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,919
shot and i'm open to ideas

866
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
i'm creating lots of free resources to

867
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,960
help people

868
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,679
and to help me with marketing right i

869
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,519
love giving talks like this i'm doing a

870
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
bunch of webinars

871
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,880
i may have some sort of coaching or

872
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
mentoring or mastermind groups in the

873
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,600
future although

874
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,159
no immediate plans so i have a bunch of

875
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,519
supporting goals

876
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
now let's say some of these just don't

877
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,840
happen for whatever reason

878
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
does that matter no they're only there

879
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,679
to support the big picture goal

880
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,200
i want to teach primarily my own classes

881
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,640
now i have two other

882
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,399
big picture goals one's going to seem a

883
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,840
little strange and a little

884
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
personal i'm not sure i'm 100

885
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,840
comfortable discussing it

886
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,640
but i'm going to my second i want to

887
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,679
spend more time with

888
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,799
family family is very important to me i

889
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,159
have three teenagers

890
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,399
one of them is 20 years old he's still a

891
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,440
teenager

892
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
my mind my 17 year old on the other hand

893
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,200
she's been an adult she's

894
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,000
since she's been 12. want to spend more

895
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,720
time with them

896
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,200
this is hard because they're teenagers

897
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,519
they often have cooler things to do to

898
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,320
hang out with dad

899
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
and my mother my mother's 87 who knows

900
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,480
how long she'll be around hopefully

901
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,799
another decade plus

902
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,159
right so supporting goals

903
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,919
getting my kids involved in my

904
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,919
consulting business

905
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,679
my middle daughter this has worked out

906
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,600
pretty well

907
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,960
i've got a a new free version of my

908
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,600
in my uh infosec rockstar booklet not

909
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,559
the whole book

910
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,240
but the booklet called it's gonna be

911
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
called something like infosec

912
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,799
rockstar 2020 and beyond or something

913
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,080
like that or pandemic

914
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,679
she's helping me write that that's

915
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
working out great my son

916
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
who is quite entrepreneurial and

917
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
is actually going to a business college

918
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,440
yeah kind of hard to get him involved in

919
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,320
anything

920
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,159
he has all these ideas and doesn't

921
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,519
listen so mixed

922
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,760
success definitely taking classes with

923
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,960
my kids

924
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,039
i took a professional bartending in

925
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,240
person class

926
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
recently with my son he wants to be a

927
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,000
professional bartender to make money

928
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,360
going through college

929
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
like i'll take the class with you it was

930
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
kind of fun although i never

931
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
want to be a professional bartender i

932
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,519
don't think

933
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,760
teaching my son to fly fish my two

934
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,120
daughters are very athletic we've been

935
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,480
running together

936
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,519
not marathons and uh they put up with me

937
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,080
i'm like

938
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,279
really slow compared to them

939
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,760
my mother's stubborn right she insists

940
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,640
on like

941
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,039
going out and she's not isolating that

942
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,120
well but i'm doing my best

943
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,760
doing the shopping for her to help her

944
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,159
out and just to spend more time with her

945
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,840
i'm cooking with my middle daughter my

946
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,080
middle daughter has gone vegan at least

947
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
for a while

948
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,640
so guess what i'm vegan one meal a day

949
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
and i cook stuff with her and we have

950
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,080
fun

951
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,799
so let's say some of these supporting

952
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,000
goals don't work out

953
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,239
let's say for example i never teach my

954
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,679
son to fly fish we never

955
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,719
go again or my middle daughter and i

956
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,119
don't

957
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,560
cook ever again does that mean

958
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
i'm not spending more time with family

959
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,599
no these are just

960
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,800
you know things to help do that

961
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,839
now my next one and this one is

962
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,560
definitely maybe a little weird uh i

963
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,159
won't have a more peaceful life and i

964
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,760
put people in quotes

965
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,359
because we might define that in

966
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,879
different ways

967
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,480
i know some of you probably know me

968
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,079
personally

969
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,119
and my life is chaotic

970
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,639
i seem to thrive on chaos but i'm

971
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
tired of it i do have some supporting

972
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,520
goals

973
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,560
as of today i've meditated for 30

974
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,119
something days i think it's 34

975
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,280
solid i have no idea if i'm doing it

976
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
right or if it's helping

977
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,000
but i'm gonna keep it up for a while i'm

978
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,160
really good at working under pressure

979
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
and getting things done at the last

980
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
minute because i am a world-class

981
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,960
procrastinator sometimes

982
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,040
uh i'm trying to get work done ahead of

983
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
time i've always tried to do way too

984
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
much

985
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
and boy my not to do list helps with

986
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
this

987
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,920
i'm reading peaceful books however you

988
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,880
might define

989
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,760
peaceful books right peaceful instead of

990
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,359
motivating books to try to

991
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,520
convince me to do more my youngest

992
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,119
daughter she's 16

993
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,680
she's upstairs right now she doesn't get

994
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,200
along with her mother well

995
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,119
all the time they fight a lot not always

996
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,520
so she's living primarily with me itch

997
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,400
is more

998
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,280
peaceful those are my three big goals

999
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
now i would suggest you think about big

1000
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,119
picture goals for you

1001
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,079
a small number maybe three no more than

1002
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,560
five

1003
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,599
now you can jot down you know

1004
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,880
10 10 12 ideas

1005
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,119
and even if you don't pick one of these

1006
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,560
big picture goals is one of the ones

1007
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,079
you're concentrating on that doesn't

1008
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,040
mean you're not making

1009
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,720
progress on them you're just not

1010
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,680
focusing on them

1011
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,079
so here's some big picture goals people

1012
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,359
mentioned

1013
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,760
from the one time before i gave this

1014
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,480
talk

1015
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,680
a bunch of people said they want to get

1016
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,119
in shape right uh we're not the most

1017
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,520
fit necessarily in this field because we

1018
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,760
tend to sit and look at computers a lot

1019
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,359
that three people tell tell me they

1020
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,960
wanted to learn digital forensics one of

1021
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,480
them is not remotely involved in

1022
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,520
forensics

1023
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,599
she's just interested and just wants to

1024
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,720
study it

1025
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
and uh and hopefully learn a bunch and

1026
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,320
maybe move into that field

1027
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,200
or see if she wants to i have one friend

1028
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
actually

1029
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,920
in town who's uh wants to be a

1030
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,599
consultant and he's working

1031
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,359
towards that doing a number of things to

1032
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,880
prepare

1033
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,800
i've had one person tell me they want to

1034
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,400
get much more involved

1035
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,200
and capture the flag competitions

1036
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,440
both to get better at it to see if

1037
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
possibly they want to move into pen

1038
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,640
testing and they also want to build

1039
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,800
their own cts i think that would be fun

1040
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
that's one of their big picture goals

1041
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,920
one person

1042
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,680
said they wanted to consolidate their

1043
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,160
life and i put that in quotes because

1044
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,079
i'm not exactly sure what they mean i

1045
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,400
know how i interpret that but our goals

1046
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,119
are personal

1047
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,440
right now remember you need not just

1048
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
goals

1049
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,000
but you need a plan and some metrics are

1050
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,560
good too

1051
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,680
along the way to see how you're doing

1052
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,160
now some success tips for planning first

1053
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
of all a small number of big picture

1054
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
goals

1055
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,960
write them down i like physical

1056
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
paper it doesn't matter how you write

1057
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
them down i'll talk about exactly how i

1058
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,680
do this in a second

1059
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,800
a small number i got three

1060
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,760
right now might change them in three

1061
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,640
months

1062
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
might change them in six months i do

1063
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,440
review and possibly change

1064
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,480
usually on a quarterly basis for me now

1065
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,440
very important

1066
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
you have to look at them regularly i'm

1067
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,880
going to claim and i'm lying only a

1068
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,000
little bit

1069
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
that i look on a daily basis i try to

1070
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,680
look on a daily basis

1071
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,119
that doesn't always happen now people

1072
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,400
ask exactly what i use i use something

1073
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
called michael hyatt's

1074
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,960
full focus planner it is a hard

1075
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,920
bound book a physical planner and i

1076
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,720
probably use

1077
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,640
10 of the pages in it but i love it i've

1078
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,079
been using that for

1079
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,040
almost two years russell eubanks who

1080
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,560
some of you may know since he's in our

1081
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
field and

1082
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,440
spends a lot of time teaching and

1083
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
consulting and speaking

1084
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,520
he's the one that turned me on it i love

1085
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,119
that i also use evernote

1086
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,599
i use the free version of evernote i

1087
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,480
have a copy

1088
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,280
of my big picture goals in most of my

1089
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,040
smaller picture supporting goals i'm

1090
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,200
using the free version right now

1091
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,560
and it synchronizes between my laptop

1092
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
and my cell phone and so i was just i

1093
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:03,760
was

1094
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,440
yesterday or the day before i was at the

1095
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,200
dentist i had like three minutes i just

1096
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
went and i reviewed the goals and i

1097
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,280
looked like yeah

1098
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,040
no surprise it's what was there last

1099
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,119
time but it helps remind me and move me

1100
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,520
forwards

1101
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
now remember smaller picture supporting

1102
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
goals right they're important

1103
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,839
mainly as support some of them may

1104
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:24,800
totally fail

1105
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,839
or have partial success and that's okay

1106
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,240
now expect some failures and

1107
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
difficulties along the way for sure

1108
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,400
absolutely just don't give up a friend

1109
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,680
of mine

1110
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
wanted to get fit or they want to get

1111
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
less unhealthy

1112
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
it was their last ditch effort at losing

1113
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:45,760
weight

1114
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,079
before weight loss surgery stomach

1115
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,800
stapling or bands or whatever they got

1116
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,560
they were in a doctor assisted

1117
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,400
diet a liquid diet they lost 80 pounds

1118
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
and one day they ate a potato chip

1119
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,160
one potato chip girl they're like oh i

1120
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,440
failed

1121
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,200
guess what they bought i'm not

1122
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,560
exaggerating a case of potato chips

1123
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,640
and they had potato chips in every

1124
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
single room an open bag they gave up

1125
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,200
because there was a failure that's a

1126
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,480
partial failure

1127
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,760
and yeah they ended up having weight

1128
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,119
loss surgery which was not the ideal

1129
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
scenario big picture goals if they're

1130
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,280
significant

1131
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,079
here could it be a lot harder or maybe

1132
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,400
take

1133
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,920
longer to achieve right if you've got a

1134
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,839
big picture goal and you achieve it

1135
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:36,640
tomorrow

1136
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,760
it's not really a big picture goal and

1137
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,560
success

1138
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
could be possibly a very different form

1139
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,319
so

1140
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,800
the first big picture goal i said was to

1141
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
teach mainly my own classes

1142
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,119
what if tomorrow i get a call from an

1143
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,200
old friend that has some amazingly

1144
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,560
exciting sounding

1145
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,960
startup and i dive into that full time

1146
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,680
as well

1147
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,079
that might be even better right have you

1148
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
and let's say very successful in a very

1149
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,520
different form

1150
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,000
you're saying love and fall in love with

1151
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,839
the f word which is

1152
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,400
fail there's gonna be a lot of failures

1153
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
along the way

1154
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,200
thomas edison supposedly had over

1155
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,319
10 000 failures at looking for a

1156
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
filament for a light bulb that was

1157
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,079
actually practical

1158
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,839
would actually last more than a few

1159
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,920
seconds and be economical enough to be

1160
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,000
mass produced

1161
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,440
could have said they were failures or

1162
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
their experiments we kept learning

1163
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,400
things that

1164
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,119
didn't work along the way because you're

1165
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,480
going to learn a lot of things that

1166
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,839
don't work before you learn what works

1167
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,200
right you're going to have things that

1168
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,119
don't work along the path to

1169
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,040
more success now not everyone agrees

1170
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,560
with me here

1171
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,480
but i think you only have one life

1172
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,640
some people separate their business life

1173
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,480
in their personal life and yes

1174
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,079
i do believe in having some

1175
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,119
distinction between the two although you

1176
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,119
really only have one life so there was

1177
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:05,920
one day

1178
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,560
last weekend where i literally didn't

1179
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
look at a computer or email

1180
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,280
for 36 hours man that was really hard

1181
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,760
for me

1182
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,079
right but really we have one life we

1183
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,720
have a business life and a personal life

1184
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,760
and they're blurred more than ever for

1185
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,640
many of us

1186
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,960
for me they've been blurred forever

1187
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,240
because i'm a consultant

1188
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,960
your long-term goals i think they should

1189
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,040
be both personal in business now you may

1190
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,640
focus on one area

1191
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,720
instead of another area depending on

1192
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,720
what's going on in your life that's fine

1193
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,160
and i always overestimate

1194
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,720
what i can get done in the short term i

1195
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,200
think

1196
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,520
as general we overestimate what we can

1197
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,440
get done in the short term

1198
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,079
i know today i had a list of things i

1199
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,119
wanted to get done i

1200
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,599
actually got them done before now but i

1201
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,200
also woke up at five in the morning

1202
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,720
because i fell asleep on the couch last

1203
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,319
night at nine

1204
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,040
usually i do not get done what i want to

1205
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,720
get in a debt done in a day that's short

1206
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,160
term

1207
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,440
but i think we greatly underestimate

1208
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,079
what we get done in the long term

1209
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,800
and here's a very scary thought to me

1210
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,599
what would you do if you thought you

1211
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,240
couldn't

1212
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,839
fail what kind of long-term goals or

1213
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,160
visions would you have if you're like

1214
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,359
i could probably do anything i want this

1215
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,560
scares me i find this to be a scary

1216
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,520
thought

1217
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,800
sometimes i would even want to think

1218
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,640
about this other times i spend time

1219
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
thinking it's it in perfect world

1220
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,079
i can do almost anything what do i want

1221
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,400
to do i want to be the first man to walk

1222
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,480
on mars or that's kind of crazy thinking

1223
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,920
but you know

1224
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,319
really what could you accomplish what

1225
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,520
would you do

1226
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,280
if you thought you know it's almost

1227
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,760
certainly gonna work i can't fail

1228
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,920
and that scares me but i find that to be

1229
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,599
very motivating to think about

1230
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,680
so feel free to share your goals with me

1231

1235
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,720
normal life

1236
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,359

1237
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,040
spare day when i'm working i'll be able

1238
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,480
to see the taj mahal

1239
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,200
again hopefully someday i'll have

1240
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,760
horrible

1241
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,480
jet lag again and say you know i may be

1242
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
complaining but it's pretty

1243
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
cool i mean i woke up in amsterdam all

1244
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,160
of a sudden

1245
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,160
