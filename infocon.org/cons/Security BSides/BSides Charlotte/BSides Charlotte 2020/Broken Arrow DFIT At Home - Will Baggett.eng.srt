1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,000
in the 1960s in the u.s army there was a

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,799
term

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,480
for an overridden u.s infantry position

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,000
called broken arrow

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
if a radioman called out broken arrow

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,519
any and all help

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
from the air infantry el air calvary

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
would come in whether it's a b-52 for

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,240
carpet bombing whether it's helicopter

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,119
gun chips

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
whether it's even a small cessna acting

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,039
as a site to say

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,560
the enemies coming in from the north if

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
you go to the west you'll have an escape

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,240
and can live to fight another day

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,960
any small amount of information was able

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,680
to

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,200
help the person on the ground

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
this talk for broken arrow is for when

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,840
the enemy is inside the perimeter

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,000
meaning for information security

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
fix my desktop is now fix my situation

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
we used to help people set up routers we

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
used to help people

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
build desktops build laptops to build

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
their home network

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
and now it's more hey you work in

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,960
information security

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
can you help me my ex is stalking me

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,000
he's still able to see my facebook post

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
he still has access to my twitter he

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,159
still has access to my cell phone

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,799
records

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
is there something you can do

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
naturally we're is a culture driven we

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
want to do something and this talk is

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,680
geared to help you get the

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
toolkit the mindset so that you can do

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,360
something to give somebody assistance

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,119
when you're working in the sock we've

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,400
got a lot of different tools

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
for digital forensics for insider threat

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,960
insider incident response what have you

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
you know we've got splunk that monitors

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,720
network traffic and we'll come back to

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,079
that one already and we'll start putting

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,280
some hooks out there

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
we can look and see the log on dates and

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
times the network traffic the badge

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
access

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
with o365 compliance email productivity

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
you can see what they're doing the edits

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
they made what was deleted

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,799
remote file access some companies use

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
druva where you can remotely connect to

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,840
a desktop to see

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
what that 7zip file on the desktop truly

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,479
contains

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
even mcafee dlp we can see

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
what usb is connected what print what

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
was printed

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
what data was copied to the clipboard

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
what sensitive data was sent out if

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
you're working for a pharmaceutical and

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
the keyboard is covered you'd probably

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
be pretty busy

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
but all that's recorded the difference

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,519
is for those of us working in a sock

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,480
there's a consent to monitoring every

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
time you log on

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
there's the warning everything you do is

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,959
going to be monitored for

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
later retrieval and analysis whether

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,000
it's

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
counterintelligence whether it's

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
security whether it's

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,800
energy compliance from doe the end user

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
is aware that they're being monitored at

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
home

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
that's not necessarily the case

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
a lot of things we're going to talk

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
about in this upcoming 45 minutes or so

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
are cases i've had with operation safe

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,879
escape

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,319
that's a volunteer organization that

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,040
provides domestic abuse

87
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
resources where it's not quite

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
a social worker it's not quite law

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
enforcement it's the gray area for the

90
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,760
technical means

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,319
we have two websites go askros.com and

92
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,400
safe escape.org

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
if you want to volunteer and help it's

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,319
help safe escape dot org

95
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,239
if you need help or have somebody who

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
wants help you can go to help at say

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,760
safeascape.org the emails get parsed all

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,640
the same

99
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
if you want a hardback book to look for

100
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,879
assistance the smart girls

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
guide to privacy is a good way to go

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
about this uh

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
this is just a short introduction and

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
appreciation of chris cox who started

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
the organization

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
and even if it's just again just a

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
little bit of information say oh this is

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
how my ex is able to get my text

109
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
messages

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,319
if i change this radio setting on my

111
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
iphone i have privacy again

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,239
then the talk has been worth it

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
so information security there's the

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
three key principles data

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
confidentiality data availability and

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
data integrity

117
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
you know it's a system question that's

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,680
something that we deal with

119
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
every day for this talk

120
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
risk mitigation principles you want to

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
control the environment

122
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,000
there's identity theft and data

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
availability so you still have that cool

124
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
cie triad

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
but the three principles the three

126
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
pillars are still there and out of these

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
three

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
the most important is to control the

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
environment if your person

130
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
whether it's you whether it's someone

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
who comes to you for assistance whether

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
it's a client family member doesn't

133
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,320
matter

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,280
if they don't have a safe physical

135
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,639
environment the rest of it doesn't

136
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,080
matter it doesn't matter that you might

137
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,199
have

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
remote off-site backups and data

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,919
redundancy if you're physically

140
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,759
assaulted at home not to make light of

141
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,800
it but this is the most important thing

142
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
and again the more pillars for

143
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
controlling the environment

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
personal security data security and

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
social leaks you have to watch the

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
social network it's not a tv show it's

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
the friends and family leak

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,400
so step one is to get off the eggs

149
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,560
if you're in danger leap very basic

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
uh we had a overseas meeting

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,160
choosing my words because this is being

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
recorded and it's going to be on youtube

153
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,759
uh long story short case officer met

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,039
with an asset

155
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,000
overseas it went south case officer came

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
back home

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
and we started debrief what happened the

158
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
station chief

159
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,280
basically sea level after listening to

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
debrief he said no bad situation

161
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,720
ever got better by sticking around

162
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,600
you don't have to ask for permission

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
when i was giving this

164
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,039
i'm an employee now of accenture part of

165
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
revolutionary security

166
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
one of the founders said i want you to

167
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,880
add this

168
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
you don't have to ask permission to

169
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,039
leave a dangerous situation

170
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,600
jim told me about a recent situation

171
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
where

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
one of the co-workers was out with

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
clients the clients were drinking

174
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
heavily

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,919
and the other consultant didn't want to

176
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,680
call a separate taxi because the

177
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
additional expense he was afraid he

178
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,280
would get in trouble for having another

179
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
expense on the account rather than um

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
fleeing the situation the same thing

181
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
here if it's a bad situation at home

182
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
domestic situation you don't have to

183
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,199
stay

184
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
you don't have to ask anyone to leave

185
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
you just leave start over fresh the next

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
day

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,199
and deal with the cards as they stand

188
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
so getting off the x here's where if

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
this was a live presentation i would

190
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,840
raise your hand and say

191
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,719
who's heard of this

192
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,000
i felt like marco rubio taking a sip of

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,639
water during the presentation

194
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
so getting off the x you want to have a

195
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
bug out bag packed a small bag whether

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,080
it's a purse backpack

197
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
with your id your cash a phone your car

198
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
phone charger your keys everything you

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
need to at least

200
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
physically leave the premises you want

201
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
to keep your physical devices with you

202
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,400
at a moment's notice if you need to

203
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,440
leave the facility

204
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
you have it right there with you now a

205
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
lot of the asterisks on this

206
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
on these presentations are from

207
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
experience dealing with cases with safe

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
escape

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
what if there's stock or where on the

210
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,960
phone how do you handle dealing with

211
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,000
that

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
what if there's uh find my family

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,280
activate on the phone and they're going

214
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
to know everywhere you go

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
one thing we've recommended is that

216
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
people keep a prepaid cell phone and

217
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,840
prepaid credit card

218
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
somewhere with them off site there is a

219
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,159
nurse

220
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,520
no she's a vet uh doesn't matter we do

221
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,318
have a lot of people

222
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
she ended up keeping her personal goods

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,319
with her personal items with her

224
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,199
in the safe in the veterinary office at

225
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,160
the doctor's office

226
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
because if you break into a house and

227
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
get documents versus breaking into a

228
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,879
medicine cabinet

229
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,479
the police are going to respond a little

230
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
bit differently that's far more secure

231
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,840
than just keeping it under your seat of

232
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,239
your car

233
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
in this presentation we're going to

234
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,080
diverge a little bit

235
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
about if you leave if they leave

236
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
this part what if they leave the abusers

237
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,520
left the premises

238
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,879
they're gone take a deep breath

239
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,479
what you do next obviously you gotta

240
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,440
change your passwords

241
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,960
change your locks and your codes to your

242
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
house to your garage door

243
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
your remote access frequencies you have

244
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
to sit and think

245
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
just for a minute what's really going on

246
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,958
here

247
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,799
and you know like the little cheeto the

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,640
username admin password admin

249
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,600
oh jeez i've been heavily involved in

250
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
the case i'm picking and choosing what

251
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
to share for the presentation

252
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
was assisting one person and the garage

253
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
door code itself when you pull the flap

254
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
down

255
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
on the keypad it says if you have

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
forgotten your keypad

257
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
your access code follow this sequence to

258
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
reset to gain access to garage

259
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
right there on the garage door panel

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
well

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
that's not really secure username admin

262
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
password admin

263
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
so changing your passwords we'll get to

264
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
that

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
not to tell you how to do things i would

266
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
say call your landlord

267
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
call your landlord call the property

268
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
manager if you own your house

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
colleague locksmith get the keys

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
physically change

271
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,040
the access key cards

272
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,279
first and foremost and after you make

273
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,560
that call and have them

274
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
coming to change the physical access

275
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,800
then you transition over i think

276
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,600
determine the

277
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
suppose you pivot over that's the

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480
industry term

279
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
over to your router and you look at that

280
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,900
clearance code

281
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,020
[Music]

282
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
so there's a movie about domestic drama

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
about a dad and his kids tragic ending

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
for the wife and older codes still

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
checked out and that's something i want

286
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
you to keep in mind

287
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,079
shuttle tidarium persistent and thorough

288
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,440
across

289
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
all the known shared passwords so

290
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
on a known safe machine and on a

291
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,760
known safe network that's a new addition

292
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
you need to change your passwords and

293
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,640
your security questions for your

294
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
accounts

295
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,079
if you're not sure if it's a safe

296
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
machine and a safe network

297
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,959
maybe consider going somewhere else a

298
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
public library when they reopen is a

299
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
good place to go the apple store would

300
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,839
work

301
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,160
maybe at work somewhere just not

302
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
where you might have stalker wear on the

303
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
machines

304
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,040
when you're setting up your new accounts

305
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,120
and this is something americans do

306
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
struggle with it's okay to lie online

307

meaning fabricate your favorite security

308
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,440

309

314
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,640

315

your favorite environment is sand events

you love waffle house something that

319
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
you're going to remember that's not true

320
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,040
that's not going to be on 23andme

321
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
that's not going to be on genealogy.com

322
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
ancestry.com that's on classmates on

323
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,760
facebook

324
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
you want to have an answer to the

325
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,279
question that's all it is they're asking

326
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,160
question a

327
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,519
they're just looking for whatever

328
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
response you give them that's what you

329
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,639
have to do

330
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,320
not what's your mother's name well if

331
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,079
you roll over to genealogy.com and can

332
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,600
look at your mother's maiden name that's

333
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
not much of a security question that's

334
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,920
can you google

335
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,560
the other thing i'll warn you is make

336
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
sure you write down your answers

337
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
probably on notepad and paper because if

338
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
you give an esoteric answer you're

339
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
probably not going to remember it

340
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,360
most recent case there is a scrap

341
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
on the desktop and it said beware of the

342
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
things you leave behind in all the

343
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
houses you change i had permission from

344
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
my client to

345
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
add this to the presentation because

346
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
this does deal with what's left behind

347
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
in the house what data can you glean

348
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,920
from what was left behind for your case

349
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
as well as if you flee the situation

350
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,279
what information am i leaving behind

351
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
that can be used against me

352
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
it's offense and defense on the same

353
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,519
side of the coin if that makes sense

354
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
so looking at your router you log on to

355
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
your router

356
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,040
and the first thing you look is to see

357
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
what devices are connected here

358
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,680
is does everything make sense you see

359
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,079
you've got

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,959
an android phone a mac laptop there's a

361
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,480
guest account

362
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
and then there's a pc well what's that

363
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,079
well that's another key point

364
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
i used to teach nato special forces you

365
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
don't have to name your device

366
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,320
will's iphone pc is the name of my

367
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,839
iphone for now and i'm going to change

368
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,880
the presentation but you want to make

369
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,279
sure

370
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,200
everything on this screen showing what

371
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
devices are on your network

372
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,360
actually belong there and if they're not

373
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
take a screenshot that's going to be

374
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,519
important for later

375
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
your standard legal disclaimer i can't

376
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,079
tell you how to cover every single log

377
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
location for the thousands of log

378
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
routers in production remember to search

379
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
for a specific model

380
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,959
save your logs change your password

381
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
if something's not right and it's really

382
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,959
not right like having a wireless cam

383
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,079
installed in your house you never

384
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,199
install them and you have to leave and

385
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,079
call the police

386
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,000
call the police this is an important

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,519
time where you want to have

388
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,079
evidence collected if there's something

389
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,719
truly amiss

390
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,839
talking with april before this

391
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,040
presentation

392
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
want to get a new router so if there's

393
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,040
something you're not sure you can go to

394
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
the local cable company get a new router

395
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,199
ask for a new ip address

396
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
and then you can enable a safety phrase

397
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,079
with the isp so that even if the

398
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,160
column the adversary calls the local

399
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,279
cable company

400
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
hey i'm bob jones calling about

401
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
alice jones account i would like to add

402
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,560
myself to it whatever

403
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,639
unless they have that safety phrase they

404
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
can't do anything with the account it's

405
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
hardened

406
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
again it depends on your local isp some

407
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,000
do some don't

408
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the local one here in tgk south carolina

409
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,639
does have this your mileage may vary

410
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
so as you're setting up your new phone

411
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,360
you get your phone

412
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
you go to settings the slides will be

413
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,279
available later

414
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,600
right now for iphone 13 i haven't

415
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
updated yet to 14 because i don't want

416
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
to come up battery life just yet

417
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
you go to settings and then down here

418
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
after you log into apple id

419
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,000
after i've changed my wi-fi router i

420
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,199
look and i see i've got

421
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,959
three devices connected to my account

422
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
that's right i have two laptops

423
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,880
and an iphone that's like it should be

424
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,399
for me that's perfect

425
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,399
then i roll over to find my iphone do i

426
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
have the blue force tracker enabled

427
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,839
where i can see everywhere my phone is

428
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,519
it's speaking back out

429
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
if that's on guess what take a

430
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
screenshot

431
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
turn it off you don't have to ask

432
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,759
permission after you take your

433
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
screenshot

434
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,480
apple's also got a great feature 99 of

435
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
the time

436
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,800
under messages where you can forward

437
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
your text messages

438
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
to both of your laptops again that's

439
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,199
great

440
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,079
but with safe escape we've seen guys who

441
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,839
think they're hackers

442
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,720
kind of insulting and they just add

443
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
their phone number to the text message

444
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,600
forwarding for their spouse and now

445
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
they're getting dropped copies of all

446
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,920
those

447
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
former spouses text messages that's not

448
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,160
hacking that's enabling a p list

449
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,199
turn it off very simple

450
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,959
same thing share my location family

451
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
sharing

452
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
obviously you want your location sharing

453
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,839
turned off

454
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,279
family sharing for all of your notes

455
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
photos everything about your iphone is

456
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,720
shared with drop copies to everyone

457
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
enabled

458
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
ah yes some people like that we've seen

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
both when i was with cia and now with uh

460
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,600
nato special forces guys will go to the

461
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
war zone

462
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,079
soldiers excuse me we'll go to the war

463
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
zone take photo of sensitive sites

464
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,680
things that happened and now grandma is

465
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,959
getting dropped copies

466
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,440
of war zone photos because family

467
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
sharing was turned on

468
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,959
if this is enabled you didn't enable it

469
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,639
take a screenshot turn it off

470
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,199
easy on the android side android's a

471
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,560
little bit more i believe vulnerable

472
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,519
i'll get some hate for that on the

473
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,199
discord channel but

474
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
i don't have my apple hoodie on but

475
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
android does have some more concerns go

476
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
to your account your recently used

477
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,000
devices

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
and see where you're signed in do these

479
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,519
logins match with what you know should

480
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,839
be accurate

481
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,039
if not log them out if so leave it as is

482
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,359
but change your password

483
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,159
a couple of the key

484
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,319
data dumps i suppose

485
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
for a google account for your google

486
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,439
takeout uh

487
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,240
magnet axiom chris vance with axe uh

488
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
magnet donate a full copy of

489
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
axiom to us we thoroughly appreciate it

490
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,520
we've been using that with google

491
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
takeout

492
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
to download every bit of activity

493
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
associated with the account

494
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,480
and once that data is downloaded you

495
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
don't get it back we all know this

496
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
so you want to make sure you have your

497
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
google takeout and your google account

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
locked down before the adversary

499
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
realizes what they have access

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
to apple has this as well there's

501
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
if you log into icloud.com there's a way

502
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
you can request your data

503
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,600
uh apple's got multiple validation steps

504
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
multiple two-factor authentication it's

505
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
a seven-day download period to get it

506
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
and then once you go to download the

507
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,440
data you have to

508
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,520
step back through the 2fa process

509
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
multiple times to get the data

510
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,360
apples is not as granular as google

511
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,160
for good for bad but all the

512
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
a lot of the video texts the ip login

513
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,039
addresses

514
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
deleted emails a lot of the data that

515
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,559
the user thinks is gone

516
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,039
is still there so again the yen and the

517
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,960
yang the good and the bad

518
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,320
this is out there you want to make sure

519
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
this is buttoned up and locked up

520
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
on the other hand if you know there's

521
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,559
something in your account that was

522
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,320
deleted you can go back and recover it

523
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,200
everybody's favorite facebook they

524
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
collect more data obviously than a lot

525
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
of tcom companies do

526
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
first step you want to go to account

527
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
settings security active sessions to

528
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
make sure everywhere you log into your

529
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
facebook account

530
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
is truly what you want if it's not take

531
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
a screenshot

532
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
log the other person out remember to

533
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,799
change your password and here's the

534
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,799
other thing

535
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
again this will be available facebook

536
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,080
records if you have facebook messenger

537
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,440
installed on your phone

538
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,679
it records all the text messages and

539
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,600
phone calls granularity

540
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,320
between a and b for at least a year so

541
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,679
if you have something horrifically

542
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
abusive you need to recover

543
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
this is one way to get it the downside

544
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,799
is if they have access to this they can

545
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
access this file the adversary can see

546
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,799
everything you've done which could leave

547
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
you in a vulnerable situation

548
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,919
so it's the good and the bad this isn't

549
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,280
telling you how to hack somebody this is

550
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
telling you this state is out there

551
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:38,160
you've got to lock it down

552
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,520
there are places on the mac people

553
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,039
some people know this oh yeah i forgot

554
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,039
about this but this is just a lot of

555
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,760
information

556
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
at once

557
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
on your mac if you go to a search icon

558
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
type in keychain.app you'll see a list

559
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,600
of all the saved

560
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,160
passwords on the mac within the keychain

561
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,799
type in the username password again

562
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,760
this is for mp's 2017 conference back

563
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,960
when we actually had physical

564
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
conferences

565
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
and because i knew the username and

566
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
password the wi-fi password is guidance

567
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,039
so rinse and repeat

568
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,280
poc or gtfo same concept can be applied

569
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
to gmail accounts whatever password is

570
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,840
stored on that machine

571
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
unless you explicitly remember to change

572
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,919
that password the adversary has

573
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,760
access to these passwords in cleartext

574
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,039
with that password

575
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,799
conversely you'll know what is at risk

576
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,600
and make sure you change your password

577
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,039
this is a new one from the active case

578
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,640
i'm working today

579
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
unauthorized access so you go to your

580
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,039
mac go down to your system preferences

581
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,280
look at sharing look at users and groups

582
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
those the two ones i just work on right

583
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,400
before this presentation

584
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,840
under users and groups you want to make

585
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
sure the accounts that are there

586
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
are the accounts that should be there

587
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,039
who has access to my account to log in

588
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,600
do i have you can have a guest account

589
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,440
shadow or being shadowed by the admin

590
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,600
accounts you know kid situation for

591
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,440
parents shadowing kids but has your ex

592
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
or the ex of your person

593
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,919
are they shadowing this account

594
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,520
through nefarious means and you can also

595
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,039
see what else is logged on

596
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,240
uh sign in i had open vp can connect

597
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,520
from the dining initiative doing the

598
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
capture of the flag

599
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,240
i want to disable that just for a little

600
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
bit of performance just because i need

601
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
every bit i can get

602
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,120
the other this is uh right before the

603
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,919
talk

604
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,799
the adversary had enabled remote

605
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
management

606
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,760
on the laptop and then had excuse me

607
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,240
had the name of the person that was able

608
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,280
to remotely

609
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,919
ssh in on port 22 to the laptop every

610
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,159
time they connected

611
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,960
again screenshot talk to local law

612
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,799
enforcement

613
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,200
disable that so the client doesn't have

614
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,080
this risk

615
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,039
but this is something new most people

616
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,400
aren't going to go this length to

617
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,840
monitor your ex but

618
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,639
it does happen

619
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,440
being persistent and thrown this image

620
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,919
it's like

621
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,640
inception i received a usb drive from a

622
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
local private investigator

623
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,280
that had files on it why else did they

624
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,000
just give me a usb drive right

625
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
so i ran disk drills a great program i

626
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
think it's 79 dollars for the full

627
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,080
program

628
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,440
it undeletes files pretty decent

629
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,039
interface you can mount it as a dmg and

630
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
harvest the files later if you want

631
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
they also have a forensically sound

632
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,679
enterprise version i don't work for them

633
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
but it's 500

634
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,400
not bad for a forensic tool anyway

635
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
i'm kind of curious to see what else the

636
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,159
pi had on there recovered this image

637
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,280
you've read probably a couple of times

638
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
so i've been talking about making sure

639
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,559
you delete the messages that aren't

640
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,440
so it's a deleted message that was

641
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,480
recovered

642
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
then deleted and are covered again on

643
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
this usb drive

644
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,000
so if you're going to leave usb drives

645
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,080
behind make sure you wipe them versus

646
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,280
delete them

647
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
or just take them with you conversely if

648
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
something has been left behind

649
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
in your of the right mind run this drill

650
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,760
and see what's

651
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
available you might find something of

652
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,799
use to say

653
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,960
i did horrific thing i have guilt

654
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,799
the more information you can get to

655
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,840
protect yourself from the adversary the

656
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
better

657
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,039
all right why's he got tv on here one of

658
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,919
the neighbors bought

659
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,720
a 65 inch tv off of facebook marketplace

660
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
asked me to move it i did

661
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
they connected the tv and saw that the

662
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,679
person who sold it was still logged into

663
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,559
facebook

664
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,039
netflix hulu youtube and twitter why you

665
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,000
want to watch twitter on a 65 inch tv

666
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,960
twitter's toxic enough especially 65

667
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,960
inches of inanity i yeah

668
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
so the person working in law enforcement

669
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
obviously went through logged everything

670
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,480
out

671
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,120
it didn't stalk the person they bought

672
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,480
it from logged out did the right thing

673
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
but you have to remember if you're still

674
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,520
logged into these accounts the other

675
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,039
person does have access

676
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,559
into a window for your life that you

677
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
might have forgotten you logged into

678
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
that includes sharing netflix spend the

679
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
7.99 a month to get a new account you

680
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,080
don't have to

681
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,080
keep using the x's account just

682
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,840
it's not worth it so even if you're

683
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,520
starting to lock your life down

684
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
hiding the evidence online there are

685
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
some apps out there that

686
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,360
are available

687
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
that might still reveal what's going on

688
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,480
with you from osnpframework.com

689
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
there's a app that will let you go

690
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
through and see

691
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,679
a person's sleep cycle so if you want to

692
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
see how well cam newton is sleeping

693
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,799
up in new england because where is cam i

694
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
don't know anymore i've lost track

695
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,240
if you want to see where is it jameis

696
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
winston new england how well he's

697
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,360
sleeping before he

698
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
plays the panthers you can plug in his

699
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,799
uid

700
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
uuid from facebook and

701
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,559
get cam newton or jameis winston's sleep

702
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,039
cycle

703
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,480
which is great if you're doing nato

704
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,320
special forces renditions

705
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,000
to see where the adversary is sleeping

706
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,360
conversely

707
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,960
even though all you're doing is liking

708
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
and updating photos of your deer

709
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,679
the adversary can still get your sleep

710
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,200
cycle just because you're still posting

711
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
on facebook

712
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,559
we talked earlier about the leaks from

713
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
family and friends

714
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,919
even if you've locked everything down

715
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,200
and you're following good operational

716
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,039
security your family and friends can

717
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,000
still say

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
oh will's going up to tk short club

719
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,919
don't tell anybody but he's wearing the

720
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,159
new hoodie he got from b-side trunk well

721
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,440
now you know where i'm going and what

722
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
i'm wearing so if you're an adversary

723
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,120
you know my house is unsecured for the

724
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
next hour and a half two hours three

725
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
hours getting on the services slow up

726
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,679
there

727
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,760
you know what i'm wearing and now i'm

728
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,120
more of a target because

729
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,760
family and friends leaked out that data

730
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,200
that's a fun example

731
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,279
but again in the nato world we would see

732
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,360
oh dad is deploying mama's deploying to

733
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,200
the war zone for the next year

734
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
now you've beaconed out to the adversary

735
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,440
that you're a target for approaching for

736
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
oh what's their specialty how long have

737
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,960
they been doing this the illustration

738
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,840
from the true foreign adversary can come

739
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,000
in

740
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,679
but on the domestic front the same

741
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,760
threat is still there

742
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
you have to watch and say mom i know you

743
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
are proud of this but you can't put this

744
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,200
online

745
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,559
you've got to have everybody on board

746
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
with it or you start

747
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,480
you stop telling them the plans and

748
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,799
intent

749
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
i realize i've got picked the pace up a

750
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,080
little bit here

751
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
with the ring doorbell i don't people

752
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,919
install them i don't know how many

753
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,039
people that in the audience have

754
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,400
actually gone back to look at the

755
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,039
quality they're

756
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,320
superb it's 1080p 4k high quality high

757
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,600
definition audio visual

758
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
adding somebody to this acl access

759
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
control list is very simple

760
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,799
you give them the email you connect it

761
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,480
to this

762
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,240
and they can see all the conversations

763
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
having at your front you're having your

764
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,039
front door

765
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,919
this being a carolina conference we long

766
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,640
talk we

767
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,240
have long conversations at the door when

768
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
we arrive we have long conversations

769
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
when we leave

770
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,919
now the adversaries got this window to

771
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,600
see everything you're talking about and

772
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,039
listening to

773
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,399
in explicit high definition detail

774
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
and you might have forgotten oh yeah the

775
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
excel has access to the store belt so

776
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
scrub it just like you're working at the

777
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,080
sock

778
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
working for security at work remember to

779
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,440
take them off that control list

780
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
the same for amazon alexa i'm not going

781
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,399
to say the phrase but hey

782
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,360
every time you say that

783
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,679
that's recorded on your amazon account

784
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,120
you've got your voice history your smart

785
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
alert history your smart home

786
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,640
history and your permissions

787
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
you know this was a bad episode of csi

788
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,799
cyber back in 2012 people back in an

789
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,200
innocent time we would tweet

790
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,799
how ridiculous this was that somebody

791
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,720
could actually remotely access your

792
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
smoke detector remotely disable your

793
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,120
burglar alarm and then start a fire by

794
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,559
overheating your printer but we're not

795
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,080
too far from that where you can actually

796
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,120
remotely

797
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,559
disconnect the smoke detector and

798
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,960
burglar alarm

799
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,399
and all i have to do is just have access

800
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,919
to alexa so again scrub your acl on this

801
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,440
and also a certified fraud examiner

802
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,480
there's a phrase called

803
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,960
implied trust unless you explicitly

804
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,000
remove them from

805
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,120
this shared amazon account they can have

806
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,559
all these things shipped to their new

807
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,720
house on your credit card because you

808
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
didn't explicitly remove them

809
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
they won't be processed they won't be

810
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
prosecuted because you still gave them

811
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,559
concurrence

812
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,600
so it's something else you're going to

813
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,158
want to scrub

814
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,640
you know printers i'm choosing my store

815
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
here there's

816
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
some of the windows properties you can

817
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,360
go back and look at the files and see

818
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,039
what was printed

819
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,880
uh some of the corporate printers one of

820
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,000
the tricks i like to do when i'm going

821
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,919
to a nato site

822
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,960
i don't have access to the network but

823
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,919
i'll hit print

824
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,200
last or print spool oh one place in

825
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,520
belgium i got a list of all the

826
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,039
headers for the emails even though it's

827
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
on class i was able to see

828
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,159
okay so this unit is going here here's

829
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:22,720
the

830
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,080
number of people that are going through

831
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
the travel arrangements and here's where

832
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
they're coming back just by the titles

833
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
of the document

834
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,200
different place classified environment i

835
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
did hit print last

836
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
it printed every single document that

837
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
printer had ever

838
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,200
stored still stored in ram for the

839
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
network didn't touch it i was expecting

840
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,120
to get one piece of paper

841
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,440
i got 500 piece of papers i went and got

842
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,720
the security officer told them what

843
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
happened like hey i'm not touching this

844
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,320
you've got a vulnerability you want to

845
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,159
teach about it but i'm not touching your

846
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,600
classified because

847
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
not authorized if that can happen in the

848
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,159
corporate environment that can still

849
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,679
happen in a home environment even

850
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
something as simple as my 40 printer

851
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
from walmart

852
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,399
remember to take the document out from

853
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
the scanner

854
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,600
you okay i'm leaving well you might have

855
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,279
left your driver's license your passport

856
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,960
open up the document open up the printer

857
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,399
and look and see what's left on the

858
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,000
flatbed before you leave or

859
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
did they leave something behind on the

860
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,960
mac

861
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
again this will be available go to vars

862
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,159
full cups

863
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,000
the documents that start with c the

864
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
files that start with c you're going to

865
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,559
have the metadata the ones that start

866
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,120
with d

867
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,880
are pdfs and those are recoverable to

868
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,960
the desktop

869
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
so here i just did the strings on a c

870
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,279
file as you will see this is a

871
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,360
coupon for world market it's always a

872
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
coupon for world market and bed bath and

873
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
beyond

874
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
but even just a metadata you can get an

875
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,080
idea of the plans in intent of what was

876
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,720
left behind

877
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,960
or for you apartment lease agreement for

878
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,480
i don't know i don't know apartment

879
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
complex but you got the point

880
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
this is all still available for any mac

881
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,400
laptop

882
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
[Music]

883
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,399
so picking this up a little bit email

884
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,960
mail and pdf and social media tracking

885
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
thanks to marketing there's a lot of

886
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,200
available data that's out there

887
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
that i don't feel people should have

888
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,519
access to program called superhuman

889
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,960
it uses a one by one cookie to pull back

890
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
and that's going to give you the date

891
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,000
time and approximate

892
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,360
gps and ip of where the person

893
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,480
read the email how often they read it

894
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,440
using a vpn will defeat that obviously

895
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
google's added this as well for gmail to

896
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,320
see how often the

897
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
email has been opened so now you know

898
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
where they're reading the email

899
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,080
and with something like docs in for

900
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,240
outlook

901
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,559
there's this beacon and you can see now

902
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,159
how long have they read the document

903
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,840
what page did they read what did they

904
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,279
skip over and now they know

905
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,600
exactly where you read the document

906
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
they've got this granular details so in

907
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,279
from business negotiations if they're

908
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,360
skipping over

909
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,080
a key clause on page 14 that you're

910
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,519
worried about that's going to give you

911
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,039
business intelligence

912
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
here you may not want to give the

913
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,960
adversary that benefit

914
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,880
so on a mac type in open terminal type

915
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,760
in ndls

916
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,240
metadata list drag and drop the file in

917
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,880
there

918
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,200
and you're going to see this beacon this

919
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
large where's the form from

920
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,519
the beacon will sit there if you work

921
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,480
with this you'll see the difference

922
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,960
between

923
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
files that have a beacon and files that

924
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
don't windows doesn't

925
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,720
have this capability yet we've been

926
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,600
looking up

927
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,960
continue to research for about a year i

928
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
haven't found anything it's a very

929
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,679
simple

930
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,360
two-prong approach three-prong approach

931
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
use a vpn

932
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,399
or use paper using print it out

933
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,240
they're not going to track out track

934
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,679
that you printed document you have

935
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,440
complete freedom with that

936
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,200
but be aware that these are some things

937
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
that can be used against you

938
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,039
another thing man-in-the-middle real

939
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,799
world aversion

940
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,720
i went to a fort mill post office talked

941
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,480
to the fort mill postal inspector

942
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,760
that sounds fancy doesn't it you get a

943
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
pdf or a jpeg of every piece of mail

944
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,399
that comes to your door

945
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,559
that's great if you're deployed overseas

946
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,919
or if you're going to be away in a

947
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,200
business chair if you remember what

948
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,080
those were

949
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
conversely the adversary can enable this

950
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,919
before they leave

951
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,480
and get copies pdfs of every single

952
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,080
piece of mail coming to your mailbox and

953
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,760
if you're getting a court document check

954
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,240
something crucial they can remove the

955
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,799
one key

956
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,840
file from the mailbox for true packet

957
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,960
intercept

958
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,399
and the victim wouldn't know this is

959
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,320
available there are two ways to mitigate

960
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,200
this either a

961
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,440
try to enable man-in-the-middle informed

962
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,039
delivery yourself

963
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,799
or go to the post office and ask if

964
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,640
anything like that has been enabled

965
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,559
so this is something to be cognizant of

966
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,080
it's a new threat

967
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,760
we haven't heard much about this but it

968
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,559
is available

969
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,240
and people are malicious that's the

970
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,799
point of the talk

971
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,120
another threat vector we received when i

972
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,799
gave this talk previously

973
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,720
were the icalendar and google cal

974
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,960
for things like tripit you send your

975
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
delta itinerary to plans at tripit.com

976
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
and it's going to park something a great

977
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,760
app

978
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,040
your itinerary your booking confirmation

979
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
your seat number arrival time same for

980
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
hotels

981
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,199
i would use this my spouse would get it

982
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,960
my boss would get it

983
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,320
client would get they would know all the

984
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
details about this but if that person is

985
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
no longer part of your life they don't

986
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,199
need to get dropped copies

987
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,520
of the plans you're going to have your

988
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,359
business because of all the intel they

989
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,320
can collect

990
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,839
so make sure you screw up even your

991
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,839
travel apps or your kids school

992
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,119
calendars

993
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,359
so

994
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,719
not everything on the internet is true i

995
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,480
hate to break it to you but

996
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,239
things can be fake

997
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,079
1 14 am belarus 115 hawaii

998
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,760
115 kingdom saudi arabia you can project

999
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,879
your

1000
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,880
gps location on twitter just like luke

1001
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
skywalker from whatever water planet he

1002
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,000
was on it and pay attention episode

1003
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,359
8 i hated it so he's on that

1004
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,000
and kylo ren sees the projection of luke

1005
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,400
on

1006
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,599
whatever salt planty thing he was on

1007
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,119
you can actually use that to force

1008
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,800
project your gps

1009
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
for your tweets to be nearby right now i

1010
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,440
could geolocate from tbk south carolina

1011
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,760
i'm still in the right gps box i can

1012
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
have my presentation my tweets appear

1013
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,920
from the western conference room in

1014
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,680
downtown charlotte

1015
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
so you're going to have some ability to

1016
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,280
manipulate where you're actually

1017
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
projecting from and

1018
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
if you're consistent it can actually

1019
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,720
hide where you are you don't have to use

1020
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,160
your true location

1021
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,079
the further away you are i did this in

1022
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,240
class last year for the nato guys i

1023
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
showed okay i'm in the back of the room

1024
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,720
and i'm tweeting from iran

1025
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
moscow and dara salaam even though you

1026
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,640
guys see me in the back of the room

1027
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
this is obviously not real the more

1028
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,160
granular the detail

1029
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
the more accurate your twitter leak

1030
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,160
and this website is tnfoleak.com if

1031
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,000
you're curious

1032
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
all that's fake that's great that's good

1033
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,079
but what's not fake is that i'm coming

1034
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,680
off of twitter from iphone

1035
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,440
that's bad come back to that in a second

1036
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,680
the grug says use signal use tor well i

1037
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,560
disagree i say

1038
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
soon your devices are compromised

1039
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,000
programs like flexi spy using m spy

1040
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,760
it's very simple to target

1041
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,839
and something like tienpo lick is going

1042
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,280
to tell you

1043
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
if you're leaking out your twitter

1044
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,200
information to say here's how i'm

1045
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,160
vulnerable here's how to target me

1046
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,359
so i would say personal meetings

1047
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,200
at pre-arranged dates times i'll see you

1048
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,560
next wednesday at

1049
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,000
toast cafe at 11 pm 11 a.m

1050
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,599
leave your electronics behind somewhere

1051
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,359
routine secure don't assume they aren't

1052
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,160
bugged until you

1053
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
know you have clean devices have

1054
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
non-verbal parole so that

1055
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,079
if i you guys can probably see or the

1056
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,520
audience can see i've got georgia tech

1057
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,079
banners

1058
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,680
if i was on facebook when i'm not on

1059
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,280
facebook but if i was on facebook for

1060
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,680
the university of georgia sweatshirt

1061
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,200
that would be the warning that hey

1062
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
something's wrong please come by and

1063
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,079
help me

1064
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,560
something's off here as long as you have

1065
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
a prearranged parole

1066
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,839
and they know it means something a

1067
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,680
misspelled hashtag in a tweet

1068
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,560
or sending out a tweet from boston means

1069
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,440
i've talked with boston fbi

1070
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,839
something only you and the other person

1071
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,800
are aware of

1072
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
there's still a lot of nonverbal

1073
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
communication you can use

1074
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,680
the adversary wouldn't be aware of

1075
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640
now for iphone monitoring they call this

1076
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,520
hacking i

1077
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,680
uh whatever so for m spy

1078
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,240
alice provides bob's mac id and password

1079
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,440
to m spy

1080
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,000
and then like was it dude where's my car

1081
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,880
and in

1082
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,480
bob's phone has to be synced to the

1083
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,880
icloud with power connected

1084
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,920
and then all that has to be provided to

1085
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,200
mspy they then parse out a backup of the

1086
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,839
phone

1087
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,680
and give all the data back to alice

1088
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,280
that's not hacking that's just you've

1089
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,720
got my username and password

1090
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,079
you're harvesting my backup but on

1091
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,720
android m spy has a beautiful thing you

1092
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,240
create a phishing sms

1093
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,280
targeted to bob's phone within a m-spot

1094
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
bob clicks on the link and now you've

1095
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,280
got access to all the data on the phone

1096
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,520
and we're supposed to talk about updates

1097
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
so for the 2020

1098
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
stock update if a work from home

1099
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
employees bring your own device says

1100
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,440
stalkerware

1101
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,200
how's your site going to respond to this

1102
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,880
it's more than an information security

1103
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,920
concern

1104
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,040
it's a life problem you can't just call

1105
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,800
jane doe in the office why do you have

1106
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,280
hacker wear on your phone

1107
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
she may not be aware that somebody's put

1108
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,640
this on her phone it's a little bit

1109
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,599
gentler concerned

1110
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,040
a little bit gentle handling and if you

1111
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
don't plan to handle this before

1112
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,040
something arises with the large

1113
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,520
employers like bank of america at t

1114
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,000
american airlines the probability of

1115
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,760
this happening

1116
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,079
probably at least one to two cases but

1117
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,599
be aware this could be something you're

1118
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,160
encountering

1119
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,520
now for trapping your device if you want

1120
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,640
to see if someone's

1121
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,240
accessing your phone while you sleep

1122
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,960
there's a great app called sleep cycle

1123
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
it uses the potentiometer within the

1124
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
phone to see how

1125
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,119
well you're sleeping at night you put

1126
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,680
the phone on the mattress

1127
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,359
goes face down and

1128
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,560
if your phone's not moving you're in

1129
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
heavy sleep if your phone's

1130
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,400
tossing and turning like you are you'll

1131
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
know you didn't sleep well

1132
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
i use that when i travel a lot to see

1133
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
you know which mattress works for me

1134
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,400
which one am i going to buy when it's

1135
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
time for a new mattress

1136
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,680
yeah that's part of getting old i guess

1137
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,800
you're worried about your mattress and

1138
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
your sleep cycle

1139
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,320
but if you put your phone on your bug

1140
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,040
bag bug

1141
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,760
out bag with sleep cycle running you've

1142
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
got the cover story of oh i just had my

1143
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,119
phone on my bag i'm sorry i forgot to

1144
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,720
put on the nightstand and now you can

1145
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,480
see your phone's

1146
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
moved in the middle of the night you've

1147
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,079
got an indication that something else is

1148
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,119
going on

1149
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,000
now the latest iphone update you've got

1150
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,320
even

1151
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,520
more granular information if you go to

1152
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,160
battery

1153
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
because we're all monitoring battery

1154
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
updates because ios updates coming to

1155
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
make you buy a new phone

1156
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,079
it's not conspiracy theory it's proven a

1157
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,520
home

1158
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,119
you can look at your battery level and

1159
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,880
see from oh was it

1160
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,240
11 pm until 6am basically i didn't touch

1161
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
my phone that's a miracle

1162
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,160
and you can see very granular exactly

1163
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,079
what device was used

1164
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,960
what app was used in those hours minute

1165
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,359
by minute

1166
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,720
so you put your phone down nothing

1167
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,480
happens that's a great sign

1168
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,079
or if your iphone or if you're imessages

1169
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,800
your twitter

1170
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,680
and your instagram or open from 3am to

1171
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,400
5am

1172
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,240
that's a problem and now you've got an

1173
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,680
indication that there's a level of

1174
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,119
distrust and you might want to start

1175
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,319
considering

1176
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,000
fleeing the situation if that's right

1177
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,040
for you

1178
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,880
we talked about using a known safe

1179
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,560
machine

1180
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,040
apple has a dual purpose in that if you

1181
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,400
reboot your laptop hold down command r

1182
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,760
for recovery you can google your laptop

1183
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,200
to make sure you

1184
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,640
things haven't changed since i gave the

1185
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,280
speech you can get help online which is

1186
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,640
actually freaking ironic

1187
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,040
but you have a clean os

1188
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,200
without any spyware stalker installed

1189
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,280
you enter your credentials from

1190
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,520
to connect to the router and now you

1191
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,440
have a clean session on your laptop

1192
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,280
clean up any spyware where you can log

1193
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,119
on to a clean gmail send something to

1194
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,599
help at safeescape.org

1195
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,960
or whoever and start to beacon out

1196
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
to ask for assistance getting away from

1197
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
the stalker situation

1198
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
and once you reboot back there's no

1199
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
trace left on the laptop unless

1200
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,040
looking around my lab here unless they

1201
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,400
actually brought it in and did a

1202
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,440
full-blown

1203
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,880
black light magnet axiom analysis but

1204
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,160
probability that's probably not going to

1205
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,480
happen so

1206
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,400
that's a lot on the iphone that's a lot

1207
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
on the laptop side on the printer side

1208
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,119
with the advent of amazon

1209
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,640
people think they're james bond they

1210
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,160
think they're cies d s t

1211
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,440
they think they're cute dude you want

1212
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,839
amazon bought something that's not

1213
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,319
hacking

1214
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,480
so something as benign as this

1215
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,839
uh micro usb camera put the sd card in

1216
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,280
put it in the wall now you've got power

1217
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,280
you have collection

1218
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,319
and you know that's great if your

1219
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,760
apartment complex is going to send

1220
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
somebody over that's not me he's wearing

1221
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,119
red i don't wear red

1222
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
unless it's a problem then i'm wearing

1223
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,680
red but now you've got this camera of

1224
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,480
okay the

1225
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,599
repair person persons coming in the

1226
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,359
house they have this i can see who's

1227
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,720
coming in how long they're there

1228
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,560
everything's good okay it has a use

1229
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,040
that's cool

1230
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,800
but if we're talking the surveillance of

1231
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
a

1232
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,640
domestic partner that crosses the line

1233
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,040
that's a little bit illegal

1234
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,720
we have three settings to play with

1235
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,400
there's the power the collection the

1236
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,200
storage

1237
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,960
with the power if it's always on and

1238
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,280
always collecting it has to be

1239
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,400
hardwired into ac

1240
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,000
if it's always collecting you're going

1241
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
to run out of storage so it's going to

1242
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,480
have to beacon back

1243
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,400
connect to the wi-fi for connection to

1244
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,680
the cloud or connection to another

1245
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,480
device

1246
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,000
so that would show up to both being

1247
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
plugged into the ac network of the house

1248
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,760
as well as a wi-fi network so you start

1249
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,000
to see how these work together

1250
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,880
if it's low power limited collection and

1251
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,599
short storage

1252
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,200
someone's going to physically come in

1253
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,680
and service the device

1254
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,960
and okay

1255
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
these are all from amazon my search

1256
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,480
history is trashed you've got a

1257
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,920
1080p camera that connects the iphone

1258
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,359
through the wireless router so you can

1259
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,040
always see what goes on in the house

1260
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,680
that's a little creepy risk mitigation

1261
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,599
for this is unplug it

1262
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,040
call the police if this has been left

1263
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,200
behind that's wire capping it's illegal

1264
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,319
surveillance they take this pretty

1265
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,720
seriously

1266
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
and i hate that these keep getting

1267
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,920
updated the more i give this talk

1268
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,040
because there's just more

1269
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,480
it looks like a normal air freshener

1270
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
it's a 720p camera

1271
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,800
has battery life and it has limited

1272
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,640
storage for the sd card so someone

1273
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,160
actually have to come in and physically

1274
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,680
monitor that

1275
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,319
the amazon alexa blink mini show me the

1276
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:20,960
living room

1277
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,400
come on that's not anything q would have

1278
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,839
to do for james bond that's just a

1279
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,839
camera connected to your living room

1280
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,200
you should know that's out there i would

1281
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,480
hope um

1282
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
the last thing is a 128

1283
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,800
hour usb recording device just for audio

1284
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,480
you flick the knob one way it's

1285
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
continuous recording you flick it the

1286
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,079
other way it's first recording

1287
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,680
um you put something like a blacklight

1288
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
logo on there or some other

1289
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,280
appropriate company tool it just looks

1290
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,720
like a company drive so if you need to

1291
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,319
protect yourself

1292
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,599
check with an attorney and see if it's

1293
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,720
legal but now you have a non-obtrusive

1294
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,079
way to monitor a conversation

1295
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,319
if it's going a little bit south or

1296
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,520
if you need to carry it during your

1297
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,920
traffic stop whatever else

1298
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,640
you get the idea because that's far less

1299
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,319
intrusive and confrontational than you

1300
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,720
know being

1301
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,480
that guy that you see on nine gag or

1302
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,319
youtube or twitter holding up the phone

1303
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,440
and recording people

1304
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,040
this is very benign if you need to use

1305
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,880
but be aware these are out there for the

1306
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,480
recording device we talked about the

1307
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
device that would come and go between

1308
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,920
you know having to service it well the

1309
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,839
nanny cam we had a case where the kids

1310
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,359
put the nanny cam right behind mom they

1311
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,960
didn't know as a nanny cam

1312
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,480
but the dad was able to remotely solder

1313
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,240
able to watch her they can't talk

1314
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,000
they would take the nanny cam back to

1315
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,480
dads or the excuse me the stuffed animal

1316
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,319
he was able to get her keystrokes access

1317
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,640
her twitter and access her facebook in

1318
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,920
stalker

1319
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,520
she was in court for about five years

1320
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,880
until he cracked the case to figure out

1321
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,480
it was the nanny cam the kids are taking

1322
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,079
back and forth

1323
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,040
so now he gets i think three meals a day

1324
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,760
a cot

1325
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,920
and health free health care in the

1326
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,760
government facility

1327
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
uh the electronic surveillance devices

1328
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,880
we've got

1329
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,920
this is a new one with apple

1330
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,760
you can use your air pods in hearing aid

1331
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,040
mode

1332
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
again that's pretty cool it's not bad

1333
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,920
but the downside is you put the earbuds

1334
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,359
in connected to your iphone with

1335
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,880
bluetooth you leave your phone in the

1336
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,760
room

1337
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,440
you walk off to other rooms and you're

1338
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,800
still able to listen

1339
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,400
using the microphone on your phone to

1340
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,240
listen to the room's conversation

1341
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,480
whoever's in there remotely kind of

1342
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,680
creepy

1343
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,200
now we've seen this a little bit writ

1344
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
large where

1345
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,960
they reverse engineered the bose

1346
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,079
headphone

1347
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,119
app because of those noise cancelling

1348
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,240
headphones are always

1349
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,720
listening to see what's being said to

1350
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,319
cancel it out

1351
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,040
now this person reverse engineered it

1352
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,079
and they're funneling that

1353
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,640
take back to their server to listen to

1354
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,839
see now what the x is saying about him

1355
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,200
so if there's something off you know why

1356
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,560
did they give me these headphones right

1357
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,440
before they left

1358
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,839
get rid of them

1359
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,240
i love amazon one of my good friends

1360
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,000
works there but

1361
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,280
it's all the things they sell are

1362
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,839
questionable there is

1363
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,680
showing my age a little bit there's a it

1364
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,040
looks like a 2g modem

1365
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,960
on a mini pelican case it goes with the

1366
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
magnet under the car

1367
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,000
it's 49.95 got four star rating that's

1368
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,160
not bad for stalkers you're

1369
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,559
37 165 people out there who need to

1370
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,160
rethink their lives

1371
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,880
it goes under the spouse's car and you

1372
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,319
can monitor it for 25

1373
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,599
a month with the app very questionable

1374
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,280
it's very easy to see you know if you've

1375
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,119
got this thing underneath the car

1376
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,520
okay but here's your beacon collection

1377
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,640
except this isn't

1378
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,280
it's not a beacon i was doing forensic

1379
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,640
analysis of my iphone

1380
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
and that's not my beacon that's my

1381
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,559
iphone driving around for quite some

1382
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,839
time in charlotte

1383
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,800
and i took the gps via kml file drag and

1384
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,079
drop to google maps

1385
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,520
google earth and there you go you can

1386
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,000
see you don't need a beacon to

1387
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,200
physically be stalked if they have

1388
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,359
access to your phone backup

1389
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,800
change passwords a couple more cases of

1390
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,359
this

1391
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,280
if you're worried about being stalked

1392
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,880
get rid of the fitbit get rid of the

1393
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,440
strava

1394
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,160
uh fitness app just don't if you're

1395
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,680
worried about that just leave it at home

1396
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,960
put it on the dog

1397
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,240
i've got deer right here outside the

1398
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,480
window put it on deer just

1399
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,839
don't publish where you're going for a

1400
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,960
jog it you'll be okay

1401
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,119
uh the latest photo 2 39 in the

1402
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,559
afternoon my phone's already on red

1403
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,359
apple's now got a family set up for the

1404
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,880
apple watch where you can monitor and

1405
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,800
see where the phone goes 99 percent of

1406
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,240
the time it's fine but if you have a

1407
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,040
situation where the x is stalking you

1408
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,680
maybe consider not having the beacon on

1409
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,839
your wrist

1410
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,400
all right well i get it it's too much

1411
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,520
i'm going to order pizza

1412
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,040
if you're on the south side i would say

1413
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,880
go to luigi's pizza it's the best pizza

1414
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,160
in charlotte but

1415
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,440
if you're like me getting this talk

1416
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,680
ready go to domino's

1417
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,599
and you have to be persistent and

1418
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
thorough because domino's retains the

1419
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,760
last two years of your order history if

1420
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,359
you order pizza every thursday night

1421
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,880
with your kids

1422
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,800
you take the kids to a new location they

1423
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,400
know your twitter pa

1424
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,720
your twitter they know your password

1425
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,800
they can still see where you are because

1426
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,400
you forgot to change your password but

1427
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,839
dude

1428
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,280
i'm skipping pizza i'm going to the gym

1429
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,040
it's finally open that's great but

1430
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,000
planet fitness now logs every login

1431
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,119

1434
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,200
so that's something else you've got to

1435
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,480
consider changing your password

1436
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,520
believe it or not we're in the home

1437
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,160
stretch identity theft is

1438
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,440
very binary if there's by

1439
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,480
identity theft you have to go to

1440
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,760
identitytheft.gov

1441
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,119
and report it this hits the fraud

1442
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,079
triangle of

1443
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,960
opportunity rationalization and pressure

1444
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,640
the adversary knows you're going to lose

1445
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,000
your income from the split

1446
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,440
they know that it's going to be harder

1447
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
they've got a divorce to pay for

1448
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,000
the chance for domestic fraud and most

1449
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,400
cases don't get prosecuted for domestic

1450
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,839
fraud

1451
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,240
there's an author pink color fraud

1452
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,000
guideline she's on linkedin she's got a

1453
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,880
book on this

1454
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,319
the da's don't like to prosecute

1455
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,920
domestic fraud

1456
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,160
so it's more

1457
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,599
urgent that you pay attention to this

1458
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,760
and make your person your victim

1459
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,119
whatever you want to call them aware

1460
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,480
that they've got to be aware of this

1461
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,440
i tie this in a thing called spoof card

1462
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,520
it's fun but

1463
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,599
you could plug in suntrust banks uh

1464
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,800
their telebank number 404-230-5555

1465
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,559
if you're a suntrust customer and i call

1466
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,160
you from this number

1467
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,160
this 544-23055 is going to show up

1468
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,119
as a number in their contact list and

1469
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,400
it's going to say this is sundress

1470
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,079
there's the implied trust

1471
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,839
and because of all the financial turmoil

1472
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,440
during a domestic split

1473
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,559
they're going to be more apt to

1474
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,640
volunteer information so you have to be

1475
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,119
aware

1476
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,040
there's so many vectors for fraud

1477
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,960
through a domestic split

1478
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,359
you have to be more aware i'm repeating

1479
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,440
myself but

1480
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,559
the opportunities are ridiculous

1481
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,200
um go to identitythef.gov if it's

1482
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,480
happened you have to report it

1483
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,119
again known safe secure computer the

1484
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,240
local police will tell you you have to

1485
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,720
log in

1486
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,920
here as well to get a case number

1487
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,280
once you get the case number you can

1488
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,640
report that to the banks and they can

1489
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,200
start to

1490
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,079
process that but for infosec

1491
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,839
professionals if there's identity theft

1492
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:54,800
clean safe machine

1493
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,720
identity theft.gov they've got to report

1494
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,920
it they have to call the police they

1495
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,200
have to contact the bank

1496
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,280
unless you report it there's nothing

1497
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
they can do

1498
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,000
the last day we had control the

1499
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,880
environment

1500
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,280
we had identity that the last is data

1501
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,000
availability

1502
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,040
we would say if it ain't in cable

1503
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,480
traffic it ain't

1504
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,160
oh yeah i was promised i was going to

1505
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,079
get a pcs to maui

1506
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,079
well if it ain't in cable traffic it

1507
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,280
ain't

1508
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,520
same mindset here if you don't document

1509
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,319
what happens

1510
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:31,279
as it happens it doesn't count

1511
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
so as you're helping your persons you're

1512
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,280
helping the victim i don't like the word

1513
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,800
victim as you're helping this person

1514
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,079
overcome

1515
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,599
a negative event document files make a

1516
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,079
label

1517
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,640
create an index this is data recovery i

1518
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,839
did shame on me you can

1519
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,040
which one is the key file which one is

1520
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,640
the spam and which one is the hotel

1521
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,118
check-in

1522
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,920
good luck with that this is recovery

1523
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,599
from disk drill which is also not to go

1524
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,079
back to disk drill i don't work for them

1525
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,240
i was able to recover all of these files

1526
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,359
with disk url but the name itself

1527
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,800
leaves a lot to be desired from the

1528
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,119
program but this recovered files that

1529
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,000
were scanned

1530
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,240
that weren't searchable with ocr

1531
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,760
so it's some good and some bad but again

1532
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,520
you got to document things as you find

1533
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,680
them

1534
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
be available for the other person it

1535
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,559
might sound basic they're coming to you

1536
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,319
the technical problem but the technical

1537
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,920
problem is just a larger part of what

1538
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,960
they're going through

1539
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,280
that's not going to be the rest of their

1540
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,240
life this is just

1541
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,000
for this slice of time i have this issue

1542
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,760
i need your help

1543
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,200
i'm talking like you know the world is

1544
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,480
back to normal but if they want to go

1545
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,160
back to go get a pizza instead of going

1546
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,839
to domino's

1547
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,599
be available for them be a normal person

1548
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,040
it's okay

1549
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,760
i shouldn't have to say that but you

1550
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,359
deal with all personality types i'm kind

1551
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:53,839
of

1552
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,200
digging a hole here but

1553
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,800
being old taking the football taking the

1554
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,559
basketball back

1555
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,920
or the gym if we can do that anymore but

1556
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,440
remember they're going through something

1557
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,319
horrific and

1558
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,839
being a good person goes a long way

1559
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,079
two is one one is none in the avengers

1560
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,760
font that i had to show off here

1561
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,599
so if you get this usb drive you get a

1562
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
copy of the phone

1563
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,920
you have your primary your alternate a

1564
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,720
contingency copy and emergency pace

1565
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,800
with operation safe escape if a victim

1566
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
has a client

1567
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,440
has key files and documents a copy will

1568
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,200
go to an attorney a copy to a family

1569
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,559
member

1570
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,319
i copy to the volunteer working with

1571
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,079
them and then another copy for

1572
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,240
safe deposit box that way even if one

1573
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,079
goes down there are three backups

1574
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,799
especially working with usb drives and

1575
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,079
laptops

1576
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,240
off the corporate system we can't go

1577
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,000
back to druva and recover the data

1578
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,480
that's been out there for years that one

1579
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,880
drive is lost the whole case is lost

1580
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,799
you want to make sure you have a

1581
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,720
documented reliable backup plan

1582
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,960
one thing couple of things to consider

1583
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,200
as we get into the end game for this

1584
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,599
we do have a stigma for being hackers

1585
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,319
people give us

1586
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,480
magic powers if you oh he's a hacker

1587
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,079
she's a hacker she can do this and that

1588
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,079
and the other well

1589
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,599
not really but to law enforcement to

1590
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,799
other attorneys

1591
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,720
anything that's an anomaly if you

1592
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,400
actually do cross the rubicon and do

1593
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
something

1594
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,760
there's going to be more attention

1595
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,280
brought to your actions trying to hack

1596
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,400
into someone's gmail

1597
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,720
you don't want the attention stay beyond

1598
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,960
reproach do the right thing

1599
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,520
now when we would terminate a human

1600
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,359
asset overseas and not turn it like

1601
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,520
we just cut the relationship we wouldn't

1602
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,480
terminate that sounds

1603
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,599
horrible instead of saying hey bob we're

1604
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,880
done with you

1605
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,400
well now you've got distrust you've got

1606
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,640
resentment hey i've got my own cell

1607
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,920
phone plan i don't want you to see who

1608
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,920
i'm calling

1609
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,240
but if you say you know going through

1610
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,160
work we've got a great cell phone plan

1611
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,680
i'm able to get a plan

1612
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,319
through them at a severe discount that's

1613
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,040
going to save

1614
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,599
you a hundred dollars a month i can take

1615
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,720
care of it

1616
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,880
that's going to help you out my new

1617
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,559
numbers i'm not sure what it is yet i'm

1618
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,440
getting well you've hidden your new

1619
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,079
number

1620
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,920
you've told them it's already happened

1621
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,280
it seems like a good thing you're saving

1622
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,400
the other person

1623
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,280
100 a month and it's done you're not

1624
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,799
asking for permission it's already

1625
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:27,520
complete

1626
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,200
it's just an example but there's ways

1627
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,960
you can approach the situation

1628
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,240
to get that separation without

1629
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,359
causing a confrontation

1630
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,799
last couple of slides i want to stick

1631
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,119
with you shared technology in a domestic

1632
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,240
conflict

1633
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,720
one device here strong encryption strong

1634
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,280
authentication

1635
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
data repository was actually used as a

1636
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,640
backup

1637
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,280
for the other source of encryption uh

1638
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,440
c3po weak encryption for domestic

1639
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,240
conflict the device was white

1640
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,240
a couple of times now and

1641
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
when you're considering leaving

1642
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,160
something behind the domestic conflict

1643
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,839
if i deleted the files or did i wipe the

1644
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,839
files

1645
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,920
last one unauthorized devices on a

1646
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,280
network

1647
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,000
looking at your router if thanos had a

1648
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,119
router he sees

1649
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,240
nebula 2014

1650
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,040
no nebula 2023 show up with a 2014

1651
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,640
network a rogue devices

1652
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,960
detected he did live memory forensic

1653
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,920
analysis

1654
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,599
shout out to andrew case on that one he

1655
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,599
always loves that joke

1656
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,960
um and thanos was able to do a takeout

1657
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,040
analysis of all the chats locations and

1658
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,720
images of plans and intents being used

1659
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,839
against him

1660
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:48,960
conversely there was a drop copy of

1661
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,720
nebula created the avengers weren't

1662
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,799
aware of their plans intent

1663
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,960
and were leaked out to the adversary

1664
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,160
they didn't know it

1665
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,319
which caused a major domestic problem

1666
