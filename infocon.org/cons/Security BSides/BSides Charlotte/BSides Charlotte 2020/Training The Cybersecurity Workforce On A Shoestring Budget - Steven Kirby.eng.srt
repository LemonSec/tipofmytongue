00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,120
i'm a security engineer

uh stopping by my talk on training the

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,719
itu

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,759
it security staff i'm glad that

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,680
i'm glad that you've decided to attend

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,199
besides charlotte

11

and i'm grateful that they invited me so

12

hopefully we can make this an

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
informative

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
and potentially entertaining session

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
a little bit about me uh i'm a former

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
graduate student in history i'm

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,360
eminently qualified to

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
work in it i was a graduate student in

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,480
history

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,800
in my younger days i was a reference

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
librarian for about 10 years

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
i've been exposed to i.t for almost 30

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
years now

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,079
beginning back in the late 1980s when we

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,920
set up a small

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,879
local area network using

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,239
artistsoflantastic which nobody

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,280
remembers these days uh we moved on to

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
nobel netwear a little bit later and i

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,359
did netware for a couple of years

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,600
and then discovered unix and i've been

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
doing

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
unix systems administration off and on

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
now for about 26 years

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,280
going back to some dusty old versions

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
like deck ultrix or

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,000
sdi irix that haven't been supported

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
haven't been used hopefully in quite a

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,560
while

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
i started with linux very early on about

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
1993

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,479
in fact my first version of linux was

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,240
running igrasil

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,200
the kernel was 0.99 patch level 5.

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
so linux and i go back a ways as i

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
mentioned i

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
currently work as a security engineer

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
and importantly for this talk i hold

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
multiple security certifications and

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,920
that's important because as you know

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
anybody who's certified

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,119
obviously knows what they're talking

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,399
about right

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,280
i should offer a disclaimer uh that the

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
views and opinions expressed during this

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
session are entirely my own my employer

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,600
is unaware of

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,799
the contents of what i'm going to

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,880
discuss in fact most people i work with

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
don't even know that i'm presenting

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,599
so this is should not be construed as

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,440
official

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
positions of any previous or current

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
employer

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
unless you've been living under a rock

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
or in a cave for the last five years you

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
know that

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
it's pop it's popular in the security

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,760
press

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
to say that skills are in short supply

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319
particularly cyber security skills

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,480
uh we have a quote from 2019 that the

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
skills shortage

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
is getting worse uh it could cost us

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,560
millions of dollars

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
there's a war a virtual war raging for

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
cyber security talent

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,319
there are thousands of information

79
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
security jobs that are going unfilled

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
there may be as many as three and a half

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,319
million unfilled security jobs

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,720
by 2021 that's next year

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,120
uh i personally have my doubts that

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,519
the situation is quite that bleak i

85
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
think that there probably

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
are some issues with structural

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
imbalances

88
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
but and this this was really real this

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
is really geared for

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
a physical conference and i hope to be

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
hopeful i'll be able to find out next

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,599
year

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
if maybe i've just missed something but

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
if the skill shortage is really as bad

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
as people make it sound

96
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
wouldn't a security conference like

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
b-sides

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,560
look more more like this look more like

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
a fraternity rush party

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
none of the conferences i've been to in

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
the past have looked like this i mean

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,519
maybe the kegger

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,360
was someplace and i just missed it i was

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
on the wrong track

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
and i look forward to going back to

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,159
another conference next year

107
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,680
and actually being able to test this

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
hypothesis for myself

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
but for the time being i would have to

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,879
speculate that maybe there's something

111
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,159
else at play

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
that maybe we're not we're not suffering

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,640
from a skill shortage

114
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
so much as we are a credential shortage

115
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
i think the skills are there

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,680
the talent is available but it's simply

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,959
not qualified

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
because the way that we hire security uh

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,400
personnel

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
i mean most security positions are not

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,439
entry level

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,320
they assume two to three years of

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
somewhat of

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
some experience uh managing servers or

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,080
networking gear or desktops or whatever

126
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
so that you have some idea

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
what the assets are that you're trying

128
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
to protect

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,320
one of the reasons that we may have that

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
shortage

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,080
is because security training is so

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
damnably expensive

133
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
uh for example if you wanted to get

134
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
training from comptia

135
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,320
for their security plus certification

136
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
which is a very popular

137
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
and very widely recognized uh

138
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,320
entry-level certification

139
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,919
comptia wants about 2 500 to train

140
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,120
one individual to study to prepare for

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
that certification

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
and that's a lot of money uh

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
particularly in

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
large corporations where the trading

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
training budget has historically been

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
viewed with some suspicion

147
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
i've heard it said that security budgets

148
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,199
are the last to grow and the first to go

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
when time when budgetary times get tough

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,320
when there's a

151
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
need to cut budget or trim costs

152
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
training is often one of the first

153
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,600
first casualties one of the reasons for

154
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
that is that the link between training

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
and corporate strategic goals are not

156
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
always clear or

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
at least not made clear uh to the

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
budgetary authorities

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
and finally a lot of places including

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
most places i've worked

161
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
training is viewed as an employee's

162
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
responsibility

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,759
we hired you because you were good and

164
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
we expect you to do your best to stay

165
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,639
that way

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
and it may not necessarily be the

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,759
company's uh

168
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,919
position that they need to be actively

169
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,680
involved in that

170
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
i understand that's not universally true

171
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,440
and if you

172
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
find an employer who is willing to

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
invest in you

174
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
that is definitely a feather in their

175
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
cap as far as i'm concerned

176
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,479
on the other hand as many people have

177
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,080
said i've seen it most

178
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,479
often attributed to napoleon if you want

179
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,400
a thing done well you may have to do it

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
yourself

181
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
and that's really what i'm here to talk

182
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
about today

183
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,759
ways that you can provide security

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
credentials that will

185
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,039
impress an employer qualify you to move

186
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,840
from maybe a systems administrator or

187
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
network administrator role

188
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,960
into security and maybe make a career

189
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,319
change or

190
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
a career path change

191
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,198
to the security field

192
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,360
there are a number of ways that we can

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
do that uh

194
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,919
one of the most common historically has

195
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,560
been

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
higher education institutions in full

197
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
disclosure i spent

198
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
25 years in higher education i'm a big

199
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
believer in it

200
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,319
but it's particularly as we have seen it

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,319
during the pandemic

202
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,919
it's not without some issues for example

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
it's expensive uh we'll talk about that

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
a little bit in a moment

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
and right now people are objecting to

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
have to spend

207
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,960
having to spend full cost for

208
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
classes that are being offered remotely

209
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,160
uh greek programs can take a while

210
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,199
uh sometimes

211
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,199
full-time a four-year degree well it

212
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,720
takes four years

213
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
there's no way to streamline that and if

214
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,759
you're taking

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,520
classes part-time uh that could drag you

216
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,560
out even longer that

217
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
it's not that local community colleges

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
and universities

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,199
aren't able to to provide training

220
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,800
but it's expensive and it's slow

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
for example i live in louisville

222
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
kentucky and across the river

223
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,560
is purdue university the state one of

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
the state universities in indiana

225
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
it's a very fine institution with a

226
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
great reputation

227
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
in information technology and i.t

228
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
security generally uh

229
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
gene spafford who would probably qualify

230
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,319
as the

231
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,039
founding father of i.t security at least

232
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,160
in the united states

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
has been affiliated with purdue since

234
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
the early 1990s so

235
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
it's a very well respected program

236
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
but it's not cheap if you notice their

237
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
program requires 180 credits for a

238
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,760
four-year degree

239
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,320
that we're at 371 dollars per credit

240
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
hour

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
if you extrapolate that

242
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,200
180 times 371 works out to

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
66 780 for a

244
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
four-year degree the future value of

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,279
that degree

246
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,320
assuming in the 30-year a 30-year career

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
and an eight percent interest works out

248
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
to about almost seven hundred thousand

249
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,200
dollars

250
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
works out really to about twenty two

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,399
thousand four hundred dollars a year

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,839
which means that

253
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,680
if you go that route and get that degree

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,200
the first twenty two thousand four

255
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
hundred dollars you earn

256
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
every year for the next thirty years

257
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,519
goes to paying off basically

258
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
the future value of that education

259
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,920
you're gonna have to amortize it that

260
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
way

261
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,440
so that means that if you're making

262
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,279
fifty thousand dollars a year for your

263
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
first

264
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
first job and that which seems a little

265
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
on the high side to me

266
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,279
that you're only really clearing about

267
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,480
uh 26 000 because you're having to

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
offset the income that

269
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
that you lost that you could have could

270
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,519
have earned or could have

271
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
you could have acquired simply by

272
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
investing that money

273
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,800
uh in some sort of security over time

274
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,080
that's expensive uh it has its

275
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,519
advantages

276
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,160
i don't recommend people avoid higher ed

277
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,079
but if you're looking to make a career

278
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,279
change or if you're looking to

279
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,399
transition

280
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,720
into something else it's an expensive

281
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
and very slow way to go

282
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
there are some alternatives

283
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,959
even within higher education we have

284
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,959
what are called

285
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
a mooc or moocs massive open online

286
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,000
courses

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
these are generally offered by large

288
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
universities some of them with

289
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,440
some of them world-class universities

290
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
that you would have a difficult time

291
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
getting regular

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
admission to but you can take classes

293
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,440
with them you can audit the classes very

294
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
often for no

295
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
no charge at all or you can take you can

296
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
get a certification

297
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
from them that doesn't carry college

298
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
credit for

299
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,959
a reasonably nominal fee there are a

300
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
couple of them i'd like to talk about

301
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,000
the first one is edx which was started

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
i guess probably 10 or 12 years ago now

303
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
by mit and a couple of other

304
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
institutions in the northeast

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
if you notice down at the bottom those

306
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,839
are not inconsequential

307
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,880
institutions that are involved with edx

308
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
most people will recognize those names i

309
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
don't want to spend a whole lot of time

310
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,760
on it because it appears that

311
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
edx has recently changed its business

312
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,200
model and their

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
certifications have gotten considerably

314
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
more expensive than they were

315
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
when i first started putting this

316
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
presentation together

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,680
they are available though if you want to

318
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,079
audit just for just to gain knowledge

319
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,440
that's

320
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
not a an unwise course a course of

321
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,839
action

322
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
so i will mention it but i'm going to

323
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,519
focus a little bit more on

324
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,600
one of the alternatives and that is an

325
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
outfit called coursera

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
coursera is also also provides training

327
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
from

328
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
prestigious universities i'm very fond

329
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,079
of the university of illinois

330
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,360
one of the ones mentioned there at the

331
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
bottom because that's my beloved alma

332
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,399
mater

333
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,959
uh but duke university in north carolina

334
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,519
is there

335
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,800
the university of michigan uh ibm

336
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,760
obviously these these are prestigious

337
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
institutions or

338
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
large corporations with a good

339
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
reputation in the industry

340
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
and all of them offer courses of some

341
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,519
sort through coursera

342
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,920
not all of them necessarily are offering

343
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
uh information technology classes

344
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
or security classes but they are they

345
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,160
are

346
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
available for uh study

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360
as i've mentioned most most moocs offer

348
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,519
the ability to audit courses for free of

349
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,480
course sarah does

350
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,720
that fee payment is required for

351
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,920
formal certificates or former formal

352
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
credentials through coursera

353
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
but it's very reasonable starting about

354
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,079
39 a month and you pay for as long

355
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,880
as it takes you to complete the course

356
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,680
so

357
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,040
it can be if you can cram a little bit

358
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,000
more in

359
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,519
it might you might be able to save some

360
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,000
money that way they do offer financial

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
aid if you're looking at an ambitious

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,480
program

363
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,360
some of their programs can take up to a

364
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,760
year

365
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,079
possibly even longer i don't know for

366
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
sure

367
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,639
most of the ones i've looked at have

368
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,880
been in the uh

369
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,279
three to three to six month range and

370
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
those will be the ones that i'm going to

371
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,680
focus on

372
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
but if it turns out that the cost is an

373
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,519
obstacle uh you might be able to

374
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,279
negotiate something with coursera where

375
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,639
they will be able to

376
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,600
provide some assistance with tuition

377
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
one of the courses that i would call

378
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
special attention to if you're just

379
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,000
starting out

380
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
is this one from new york university's

381
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,639
college of engineering

382
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,440
uh it's it's offered by a gentleman

383
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
named eddie moroso

384
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,399
amoroso used to be i believe he was a cs

385
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:52,720
the

386
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,120
ciso or cso at a t for a while

387
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
uh and he has a fascinating background

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
he's been around for a while

389
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,839
and the stories that he tells in class

390
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
some of the anecdotes are rich just

391
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,399
because of the historical value

392
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,839
so if you're looking for a place to

393
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,480
start i would recommend this very highly

394
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
i have i've actually audited this course

395
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,839
myself

396
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
because i was curious what it was about

397
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
and i have to say i enjoyed that process

398
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,639
tremendously

399
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,680
another one that is very fairly recent i

400
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,279
just discovered the next two

401
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,079
in the last couple of months and i've

402
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,360
talked to a couple of our

403
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
younger people at work that are have

404
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,199
started taking

405
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,639
at least the first course the

406
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
certificate program from ibm

407
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
on cyber security analyst and they've

408
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
been very impressed with what they've

409
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,279
seen so far

410
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,480
this is an entry-level certificate that

411
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,800
off

412
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
i think it takes about three months to

413
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
complete

414
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,760
uh and would be an injury would be a

415
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
good entry-level credential to be able

416
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
to show to somebody

417
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
that it demonstrates that you can

418
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
complete some that you can complete a

419
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,600
task

420
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
you've got a you've got to validate your

421
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,959
interest in knowledge

422
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,680
insecurity and as i say might be a good

423
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
place to start

424
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
if that's what you want to do if you've

425
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
decided that's what you want to do

426
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
if you want to get a little bit more

427
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,040
serious about it ibm also offers what is

428
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
called a specialization and that's more

429
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,240
extensive

430
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
uh training and security matters

431
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
i think it i think this one runs six or

432
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
eight months something like that

433
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
so it's a little bit more involved but

434
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
uh

435
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,920
it's an extension of the certificate

436
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,959
program

437
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,360
it both of those might be worth taking a

438
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,079
look at and as

439
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
you notice on the screen uh you can do a

440
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,560
seven day full access

441
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
trial to see if this is something that

442
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
you might be interested in

443
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,000
to kind of get a feel for what these

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,079
courses might be like

445
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,359
and what what they're going to cover

446
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
i've got one more that doesn't really

447
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
fit the mooc

448
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
uh model but i didn't have any place

449
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
else to put it

450
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
so i'm going to talk about security blue

451
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
team this is a british outfit that has

452
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,360
just recently started i think in the

453
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
last year or two

454
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
they are now providing training for what

455
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,199
they as they say

456
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,600
defensive cyber specialists the the name

457
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
pretty much explains it

458
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
uh they currently offer courses

459
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
uh i think the cost was about

460
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,199
20 20 british pounds which i believe is

461
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,040
about 30 dollars per course the last

462
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,079
time i looked

463
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
i didn't i haven't verified it lately

464
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
but it would be worth looking at and at

465
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
the end of each course

466
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,839
uh level one level two level three

467
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,519
the theory is that you'll be able to

468
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,240
take a certification exam that validates

469
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
that you've you've learned the material

470
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
uh level one is available now

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
levels two and three will be forthcoming

472
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
probably in the next year or so

473
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,199
but again if you're looking to

474
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,919
uh cut your chops and show that you have

475
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,199
some

476
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
uh background that might be of interest

477
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,199
in possible

478
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
use to an employer this would be another

479
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,599
place that you might want to start

480
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,039
the big question that we want to talk

481
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,000
about though is are you certifiable i've

482
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,359
had people tell me that i

483
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,760
am for years but i think they meant in a

484
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
different context

485
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
here we're talking about cert being

486
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
certifiable

487
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,799
in the context of information being of

488
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,799
information security

489
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,919
uh certifications have a lot of

490
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,440
advantages over more

491
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,080
formal uh forms of education

492
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,799
the big ones are there faster cheaper

493
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,280
and more directly focused on job skills

494
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,000
because

495
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,440
a lot of these are designed to provide

496
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
to document that you possess skills that

497
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
employers are looking for

498
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,640
and that's how these credentials are

499
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
able to earn their reputation

500
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,360
one potential model or road map for

501
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,600
deciding what certifications

502
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
you're interested in would be the

503
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,679
department of defense's

504
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,760
8570 section 8570 program

505
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,919
if you're going to work for the dod in

506
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,640
any capacity whether it's a civilian

507
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,600
or as a service person you're going to

508
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,120
need to be aware of this because

509
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
these are certifications that it are

510
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,039
required to advance

511
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
and to even qualify for entry level

512
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
positions

513
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,640
it's not something that necessarily

514
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
is looked at quite the same way in

515
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
private industry

516
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,600
but it's a useful guide because it gives

517
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,799
you somebody

518
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,600
somebody some influential employers idea

519
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
of what certifications are worth i

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
mention it here

521
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
it's kind of a reference we'll come back

522
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,280
to the idea of a road map a little bit

523
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
later

524
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
towards the end of the session but if

525
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
you're looking for

526
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
places to start and what certifications

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,679
you might want to

528
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,799
aim for in the future this is one

529
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
possible way of finding that out

530
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
uh other there are other ways i mean

531
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
i've seen very often

532
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
uh people cite the number of times that

533
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,000
a particular

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
certification is mentioned in job ads

535
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
that's a little bit hit or miss because

536
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
you don't know whether

537
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,960
that certification was listed as a

538
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
requirement or

539
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
as desired or as an example of something

540
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,160
that's required

541
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,559
or desired so this provides you

542
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,720
something a little bit more tangible

543
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,039
than just the idea that it got mentioned

544
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,559
in somebody's advertisement

545
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
the first thing i want to talk about

546
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,679
would be vendor certifications

547
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
and there are a couple of vendors that i

548
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
think merit particularly

549
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,559
mention microsoft does offer a nice

550
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,760
introduction

551
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
retroductory level certification in

552
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,120
security

553
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,440
and then the other vendor has been cisco

554
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
historically cisco has been

555
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,200
a major player in security

556
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
certifications

557
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
but it looks to me like some of the

558
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
changes they've announced in their

559
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
certification programs

560
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
lately indicate that they're kind of

561
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,039
stepping back from that a little bit

562
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
microsoft offers their technology

563
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,159
associate certification

564
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,640
and as i say this is entry level it's

565
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,520
aimed at

566
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,400
recent high school or college graduates

567
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
or maybe someone who's working on a help

568
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,120
desk

569
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,840
somewhere and looking to advance to a

570
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
different position

571
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
it's it would it would be almost an

572
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
ideal first certification

573
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,559
and there are several advantages to it

574
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,400
it's not a terribly expensive

575
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,120
uh certification uh there are a number

576
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,640
of ways that you can prepare for it

577
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,799
we'll talk about some of those

578
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,400
and it does provide documentation that

579
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,840
you're familiar with some of the core

580
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,600
security concepts

581
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,559
as well as that you can see a program

582
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,080
through to completion

583
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
there are other microsoft mta microsoft

584
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,440
mta

585
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,000
certifications besides security some of

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,760
those might be worth investigating as

587
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,080
well

588
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
for example they offer one on windows

589
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,120
servers

590
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
administration they offer an

591
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
introductory networking certification

592
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,760
all those might be useful to look at but

593
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
i wanted to call special attention to

594
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
the security mta

595
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
because right now that's i as far as i

596
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
know the only security

597
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,520
certification that microsoft offers

598
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,679
i mentioned cisco and not too long ago

599
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,200
they introduced the

600
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,799
certified cyber cyber ops credential

601
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,799
and it is still available it is one of

602
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,919
the it is

603
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,760
the main security credential now that

604
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
cisco offers

605
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,880
uh it is an introductory level

606
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,039
certification but probably on a little

607
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,559
bit higher level

608
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,679
than microsoft's mta uh

609
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,520
if particularly if you're coming from a

610
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,360
networking background

611
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
and you want to explore what might be

612
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,679
available in security and possibly

613
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,000
make a transition this would definitely

614
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
would be something that you would want

615
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
to investigate

616
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
of

617
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,880
the used to be a cc there was a ccna

618
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,120
or cisco network associate i believe it

619
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,919
is

620
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,000
insecurity and apparently that doesn't

621
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
exist anymore

622
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,280
uh there's now one ccna to rule them all

623
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,159
and it is a general credential so i'm

624
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
not sure how long

625
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
organizations are going to recognize the

626
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
old ccna i would assume that those are

627
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,039
going to be grandfathered in and will be

628
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
good for life

629
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
but i have i guess that will probably

630
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
vary from institution to institution

631
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
but i did want to mention that it looks

632
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,919
like cisco has stepped back a little bit

633
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,440
from the prominent role that they used

634
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,520
to play security certification

635
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,320
probably because network security is

636
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,080
network certification is really their

637
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
core business

638
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
and there's a lot of other competition

639
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
that makes the security route

640
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
difficult and expensive for them to

641
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
maintain

642
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,320
we need to talk to about some

643
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,039
certification bodies

644
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,640
some of the most important ones would

645
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,440
include comptia

646
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
the computer technology industry

647
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
association

648
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
they offer several security

649
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
certifications including one

650
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,760
we've mentioned already security plus

651
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
that is probably the best known

652
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
entry-level security certification on

653
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
the market

654
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
and it's certainly well-regarded one

655
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
they offer several others

656
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,159
a scissor plus which is the cyber

657
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,720
security analyst i believe

658
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
it is a blue team certificate

659
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
if you are looking to become

660
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
knowledgeable to demonstrate knowledge

661
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
and background

662
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,840
in blue team activities in

663
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
incident response or cyber self-defense

664
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
that might be a security certification

665
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
that you would want to pursue

666
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,520
it's an intermediate level certification

667
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,679
as is pentest plus which is its

668
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,880
counterpart

669
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,279
uh as the name suggests pentest plus is

670
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,480
a red team

671
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
certification for people who like to

672
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,880
break into systems

673
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,679
but with a white hat for they're doing

674
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
they're using their power for good as

675
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
you should

676
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,919
uh it is a relatively recent

677
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,840
certification i think it came out in

678
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,760
2018 if i remember correctly uh

679
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,720
and it's got a developing file one but

680
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
it i don't think it quite has

681
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,360
the uh recognition that some of the

682
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,919
other

683
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,679
uh comptia certifications do as of yet

684
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,840
the last one to re to mention is the

685
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
cast plus

686
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,559
uh i hold this one it is

687
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,279
that is geared towards senior level

688
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,960
security people with

689
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
10 years of experience who don't want to

690
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
go into management who want to remain

691
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,480
technical and that's how it uh seeks to

692
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
differentiate itself

693
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,679
from other certifications that we'll

694
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,679
talk about here in a minute

695
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,679
uh i read on dice.com back during the

696
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,559
spring that

697
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,039
this is one of the emerging

698
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,400
certifications for

699
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
2020 so if you fit that category where

700
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,200
you're looking for

701
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
a senior level certification but you

702
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,760
don't necessarily want to

703
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,840
pursue a path that will prepare you for

704
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
management

705
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,559
cast plus might be one that you would

706
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,360
want to consider

707
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
one of the neat things that comptia has

708
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,559
started doing in recent years is the

709
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,520
concept

710
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,159
of stackable certifications and what

711
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,400
that means is that if you earn

712
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
two or more certifications you get

713
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,919
an extra certification as a bonus for

714
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:02,880
example

715
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,559
uh if you get the security plus

716
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,279
and comptia's cloud plus certification

717
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,240
you automatically

718
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,720
qualify for the secure cloud

719
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,480
professional certification

720
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,919
without having to take any other

721
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
additional exams

722
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,400
and as you progress you can actually

723
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,880
it almost gets to be like a video game

724
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,600
because they they do multiply so quickly

725
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,559
uh if you i think ultimately you can get

726
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,000
i i have a number of them

727
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,440
it and it makes for an impressive

728
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
impressive looking collection i guess if

729
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,520
you just value having stuff to hang on

730
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,799
the wall

731
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,240
but these are all valuable

732
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,640
certifications that i think would be of

733
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
interest to employers at least they have

734
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
been to folks that i've talked to

735
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
and i thought i'd mention them because

736
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
that is another another path to

737
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,440
demonstrate your knowledge

738
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
the next one that i want to talk about

739
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,000
is isc squared or the international

740
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,720
information system security

741
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,840
certification

742
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
consortium say that three times real

743
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
fast

744
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
there's a reason why it's almost

745
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,679
universally known as isc

746
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,960
squared ise square offers

747
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,000
two very well known certifications uh

748
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,159
the lower ranking one would be the

749
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,120
system security certified practitioner

750
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,760
and if i were going to recommend a

751
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,559
an initial certification for someone

752
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,240
with maybe two to three years of

753
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,960
experience on a help desk or

754
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,720
as a junior administrator of some sort

755
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,559
this would be the one uh sscp

756
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,240
is a natural transition to the cissp

757
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
that we'll talk about in a moment

758
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
uh it is it does have isc square's

759
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,600
reputation behind it

760
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,640
so it has it does have some influence uh

761
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,559
it's also considerably cheaper believe

762
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,840
it or not than

763
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
some of the other uh alternatives i i

764
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,520
think most

765
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,880
places i've seen a voucher for example

766
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,320
security plus

767
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,000
running somewhere around three hundred

768
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
dollars the event the voucher directly

769
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,080
from ise squared for

770
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,000
sscp is 249 dollars

771
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,880
and again i can tell you from experience

772
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,520
that

773
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,279
studying for sscp will get you

774
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,399
a large percentage of the way towards

775
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,600
cissp which is the next

776
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,720
certification we want to talk about the

777
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,600
cissp is probably the gold standard

778
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,159
for security certifications in the

779
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,840
marketplace in 2020 and

780
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,200
has been for quite a while uh if you are

781
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,039
looking to become

782
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,200
cso at a company or if you are looking

783
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
to become

784
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,840
some form of technol of security

785
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,399
management

786
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,799
cissp is going to be an almost a

787
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,080
requirement

788
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,320
and if you're looking for even some

789
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,720
senior level technical positions like a

790
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,080
an architect position a lot of employers

791
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
are going to look more favorably on the

792
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,919
cissp than any other credential

793
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,480
the downside to the cissp is that it's

794
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,679
expensive

795
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,679
uh i will i don't recall exactly what

796
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,840
the latest

797
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,080
uh certification costs but i think it's

798
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,679
about eight hundred dollars

799
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,000
so it's not an inexpensive examination

800
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,039
to sit for

801
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,039
but the return on the investment can be

802
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,320
quite high

803
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,720
uh and as i say it is the gold standard

804
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
for security certifications

805
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
so it's definitely one you need to be

806
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,918
aware of if you weren't already

807
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,279
another not necessarily gold

808
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,559
standard but definitely on

809
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,480
approaching the ise squared level would

810
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
be isaka

811
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
uh which had the good sense to change

812
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,240
its name from the information systems

813
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,080
audit and control association to just

814
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,440
isaca because

815
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
nobody nobody used their real name

816
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,559
either

817
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,320
and they offer several interesting

818
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
credentials one that i was surprised to

819
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,600
find out i just

820
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,120
discovered the first one a few months

821
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,640
ago and that's the

822
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,039
csx cyber security fundamentals

823
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,399
certification

824
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,520
again it's an entry-level cert uh

825
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,159
and it is also quite reasonably priced

826
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,200
as well

827
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,240
it does not have an expiration date uh

828
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,720
with

829
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,720
security plus and sscp you would have to

830
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,679
recertify i think after three years i

831
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,480
know in the case

832
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,240
it's three years in the case of security

833
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,600
plus and i believe sscp is the same

834
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
the cyber security fundamentals uh

835
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
certification from isaca

836
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
does not require that so once you've

837
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,640
earned it

838
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,960
it's yours it's yours to keep forever

839
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
probably their two best known

840
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
certifications are

841
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,120
excuse me the cism

842
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,919
cssm the certified information security

843
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,960
manager

844
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
which as the name suggests would be very

845
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
appropriate for someone

846
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,440
looking for a management credential

847
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
and then the certified information

848
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,159
systems auditor

849
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,519
those last two are definitely senior

850
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,960
level credentials so they would be

851
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
something that

852
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,159
you would aspire to after five to ten

853
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,840
years experience

854
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,640
in the security field as you are ready

855
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,840
to make a transition

856
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,039
from a hands-on techie to

857
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,919
managing hands-on techies and the

858
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,039
auditor

859
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,720
obviously is geared towards people who

860
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,480
are going to be uh

861
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
auditing involved in auditing and

862
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,600
compliance

863
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,640
uh both of the both of these are widely

864
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
recognized and widely respected

865
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,679
credentials

866
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,919
and anything from my saca is going to

867
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:56,960
have

868
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,799
name recognition with employers

869
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,880
the last certification body i want to

870
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
talk about is mile

871
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,120
two uh this one has been

872
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,000
this body has been somewhat

873
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,039
controversial

874
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,440
on certification discussion forums uh

875
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,279
because there's some question as to how

876
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,000
widely recognized their certs are

877
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,159
full disclosure i have three from them

878
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
in fact mile two is basically what i

879
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,519
have done during the

880
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,080
to keep myself entertained during the

881
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,720
coronavirus pandemic

882
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,880
mile t specializes in alternative

883
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
certifications

884
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
a lot of their certifications are

885
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,919
loosely based

886
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
on something else the advantage that

887
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,039
they have is

888
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,039
they don't have some of the overhead for

889
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,080
example work experience requirements

890
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,159
that are required to even sit for

891
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
something like the cissp

892
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,840
or the cism or

893
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,000
cisa you pass the

894
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,159
if you can pass the test you qualify for

895
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,440
the certification

896
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
and that's the end of the story and

897
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,039
these are not

898
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,600
these are not simple certifications uh

899
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,640
for example

900
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,240
i've mentioned that they're some of

901
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,919
their certs are generally

902
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,080
based on other more widely known certs

903
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,440
uh the cisso comp that compares to the

904
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
cissp

905
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
in fact mile two's version was developed

906
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,480
by the same gentleman kevin henry who

907
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,880
developed the training materials for

908
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,159
ise squares cissp

909
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,080
so he's very knowledgeable about about

910
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,360
the material

911
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
and from what i can tell they cover a

912
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
lot of the same questions

913
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,000
they just it just doesn't have the

914
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,399
necessarily the same recognition

915
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,600
but if you've got some other

916
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,080
certifications to hang your hat on

917
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,200
that may not be such a big deal uh

918
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,880
other certifications for mile 2 that

919
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,559
might be worth mentioning would be

920
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,200
the cissm which maps to the cism from

921
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,880
asaka there is a cissa

922
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
that compares to the cici for my

923
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
saca and the c-i-a-h-e which is an

924
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,119
incident handler

925
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,159
certification that compares to the

926
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,800
jack or sans institution gcih which

927
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,719
is simply not going to be in my my

928
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,879
budget anytime soon

929
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,000
uh either to prepare for

930
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
or to sit for i mean sans exams

931
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,719
certifications are very widely regarded

932
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,079
very highly regarded very

933
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,480
widely respected but they are

934
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
prohibitively expensive unless you can

935
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,879
find

936
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,280
at least for most people i know unless

937
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
you can find someone else

938
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,839
who's willing to to pay the examination

939
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,280
fee

940
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
so in to summarize so far

941
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,200
here here's one possible set of uh

942
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,480
career paths that you might might follow

943
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
as you look to advance your credentials

944
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
in cyber security you might want to

945
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
begin with something like

946
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
the microsoft mta or cisco cyberops

947
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
security plus sscp

948
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,119
or the cyber security fundamentals

949
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,240
certification from isaka uh those would

950
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,440
require anywhere from

951
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
zero to probably three years of

952
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,720
experience

953
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,000
uh before you can before you can really

954
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,440
get the most out of them uh

955
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,040
you if you have a little bit more

956
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
experience as you as your career

957
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,079
progresses

958
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,560
you can look at other certifications

959
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,800
like the sisa plus that i mentioned

960
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,240
or pentest plus the sscp does a little

961
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,480
bit of double duty here because

962
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,320
it uh covers some of the ground that

963
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,280
comptia has split off from what what the

964
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,040
security plus used to be

965
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,359
and they've used that to populate their

966
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,079
intermediate

967
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,680
certs the sscp from ise squared covers

968
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,720
some of that same

969
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,640
ground uh in a single certification

970
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,400
and then if you're if you're feeling

971
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,119
ambitious

972
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,160
the cisso from mile 2

973
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,240
might be a way to get your feet wet and

974
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,000
find out where you stand

975
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,480
without spending the full price to sit

976
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,920
for the cissp

977
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,680
and maybe have it qualify as an

978
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
associate which

979
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
we you would have to do if you didn't

980
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,880
have requisite uh

981
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,839
work experience and other background and

982
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,480
finally

983
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,680
if you're once you reach the seven to

984
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
ten year mark

985
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,640
you might look at something like casp

986
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
plus or the cissp

987
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,440
or one of the isaccar credentials is a

988
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
way to

989
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,040
put a an exclamation point on your

990
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,000
career progress

991
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
we need to talk some about online

992
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
training providers and where you can go

993
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,680
to prepare

994
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,320
for these certifications because as i

995
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,839
mentioned early on

996
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,079
uh getting trained for most of these

997
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,839
search directly from the vendor is going

998
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,079
to be very very costly

999
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,920
and if you're doing it yourself if

1000
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,000
you're having to fund your own

1001
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,119
uh security

1002
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,079
certification preparation you're

1003
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,680
probably going to want to do so at the

1004
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,599
lowest possible cost that will enable

1005
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,800
you to prepare

1006
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,480
to pass the certification exam

1007
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,640
one of the most popular ways to do this

1008
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
or one of the most popular vendors

1009
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,320
of certification preparation and other

1010
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,200
training is plural site i recommend them

1011
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,560
very highly

1012
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,320
i generally i have had my own

1013
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,599
subscription

1014
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,320
uh from time to time i don't have it i'm

1015
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
it's not currently active

1016
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,200
because i'm doing some other things but

1017
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,760
i recommend them very highly

1018
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,400
they provide for example their

1019
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
certification course for

1020
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,359
sscp and cissp training

1021
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,800
is developed by kevin henry who

1022
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
developed the training that

1023
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,560
you would actually pay ise square to

1024
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,440
take

1025
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,079
but you can you can get his uh course

1026
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:08,880
directly from

1027
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,359
pluralsight for a relatively low fee i

1028
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,560
think it's about 30

1029
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,960
a month right now or at least it was a

1030
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,800
few months ago when i was still

1031
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
i had an active subscription

1032
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,000
and as i mentioned in addition to

1033
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
certification training pluralsight

1034
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,040
offers

1035
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,359
uh courses on multiple topics that might

1036
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,520
be of interest to security staff

1037
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,960
for example software solutions like

1038
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,280
splunk or ibm's q radar

1039
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
both event log or sim solutions

1040
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,480
uh vulnerable scanning with

1041
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,320
vulnerability scanning

1042
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,240
with uh tenable nessus or if they

1043
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
their course is aimed at open vas but

1044
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,720
openvas as such doesn't exist anymore it

1045
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,760
is now the

1046
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,440
green bone security assistant

1047
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,640
gsa i believe uh and it's more of a

1048
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,240
demo for the commercial product

1049
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
unfortunately but you can still

1050
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,119
at least master some of the fundamentals

1051
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
of vulnerability scanning

1052
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
by using that product in conjunction

1053
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,400
with the

1054
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,240
training on vulnerability scanning that

1055
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,640
is available through pluralsight

1056
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,240
and if you're looking for training on

1057
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
security frameworks and that's a popular

1058
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,599
topic these days

1059
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,640
you want to learn the iso 27000 series

1060
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,280
or

1061
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,000
nist or pci dss there are individual

1062
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
courses on that that are available

1063
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,160
through

1064
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,640
pluralsight very similar to pluralsight

1065
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:32,960
is

1066
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
linkedin learning which would used to be

1067
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,359
known as lynda.com and they've been

1068
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,280
around for quite a while too

1069
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,440
they were recently well a year or two

1070
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,200
ago i think purchased

1071
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,280
uh by microsoft and merged into linkedin

1072
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
if you have a premium subscription to uh

1073
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
linkedin which again i think is about

1074
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
thirty dollars a month

1075
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,960
you have access to one to uh linkedin

1076
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,000
learning

1077
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,599
again it's very similar uh in scoping

1078
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,720
and intent to plural site you will find

1079
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
training on a wide range of subjects

1080
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,319
including a lot of courses that can be

1081
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,760
useful

1082
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,440
for certification preparation

1083
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,359
i want to mention make special mention

1084
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,520
of udemy in some ways udemy is my

1085
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
favorite

1086
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,599
of the certification providers they

1087
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,839
provide

1088
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,800
they're they contrast a little bit with

1089
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,520
uh

1090
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,760
linkedin learning and with pluralsight

1091
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,359
with those courses you pay a monthly

1092
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,440
subscription and you get access to

1093
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,079
their whole range of training whatever

1094
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,480
you

1095
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,240
whatever you want to study that at that

1096
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,079
minute if they've got a course

1097
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,560
you can take it you to me it's a little

1098
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,520
bit different you

1099
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,000
purchase access to a course and then

1100
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,480
that course is yours for life

1101
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,920
uh whereas with pluralsight

1102
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,800
and with linkedin learning you may you

1103
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,720
will find generally

1104
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,640
one course per topic if you're looking

1105
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,000
for example for

1106
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
security plus training they will have

1107
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
one set of courses

1108
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
uh from usually from one uh trainer

1109
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
that deals with the subject matter udemy

1110
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
is a little bit different you can have

1111
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,359
mult canon will find multiple training

1112
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,839
providers for most of the major

1113
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,480
certifications

1114
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,359
so you have have a wide range of choices

1115
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
some of these choices are very very

1116
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,200
some of these alternatives are very very

1117
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
good

1118
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,359
some of them are not so you need to pay

1119
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,560
attention to

1120
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,760
things like the reviews available one of

1121
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,599
the nice things about udemy is they do

1122
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,160
offer

1123
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,880
a trial so if you don't like the course

1124
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
after 30 days you can get your money

1125
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,839
back

1126
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,319
uh the other thing that is noteworthy

1127
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,720
about them is that very frequently

1128
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,599
they offer reduced prices for training

1129
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,560
courses

1130
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,960
i don't recall ever having paid full

1131
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,640
price for a udemy course

1132
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
if you wait maybe a month almo it seems

1133
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,079
like

1134
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,920
inevitably the course is going to be

1135
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,240
available for

1136
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,119
9.99 or 11.99 or something like that

1137
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,119
as opposed to in some cases the list

1138
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,480
price which could be over a hundred

1139
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,359
dollars

1140
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,400
per course but the advantage that udemy

1141
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,200
has is that

1142
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
you do have a range of providers if you

1143
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,480
don't see one

1144
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,720
if you don't like a particular course

1145
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,839
you may be able to find

1146
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,160
one that you do like from someone else

1147
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,599
for example for

1148
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,240
uh the microsoft mta cert security

1149
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,440
certification

1150
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,760
here we have multiple courses that could

1151
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,760
be used to prepare for that examination

1152
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,560
uh i would call attention to a couple of

1153
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,760
things here

1154
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,599
that are a little bit more important

1155
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
that they might be for

1156
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,160
providers like pluralsight and linkedin

1157
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,440
you need to check the expiration date

1158
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,400
or the up last day update on each of

1159
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,760
these courses because

1160
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,680
sometimes you'll find courses here that

1161
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
go back

1162
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,640
number of years in fact if you want to

1163
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,800
look for i believe that

1164
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,280
there are still certification prep

1165
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,480
courses for

1166
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,960
the previous version of security plus uh

1167
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,480
that are still available through you to

1168
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,920
me and if you're not careful you can

1169
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,960
wind up

1170
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,400
buying something that really won't do

1171
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,480
you much good to prepare for the current

1172
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
version of the examination

1173
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,000
so you might want to check and make sure

1174
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
that the course is currently being devel

1175
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,560
updated and it's also useful to notice

1176
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,200
the

1177
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,599
student ratings that might give you some

1178
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,720
benchmark

1179
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,480
of how other people have looked at the

1180
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,720
course they do provide reviews

1181
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,560
the opportunity for people to provide

1182
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,040
reviews the way that amazon does for

1183
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,480
products for example

1184
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,240
and so you get some idea of what people

1185
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,000
did and did not like

1186
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
about a particular course and again as i

1187
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,119
mentioned

1188
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,359
uh they do offer a 30-day money-back

1189
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,480
uh guarantee if you buy the course and

1190
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,319
decide that you don't like it

1191
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,079
i've actually taken advantage of it

1192
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,160
several times and they're very prompt

1193
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,680
about refunding and that's one of the

1194
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,720
reasons that

1195
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,200
i am so fond of you to me as a training

1196
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,839
provider

1197
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,200
another interesting uh provider is pac

1198
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,079
publishing

1199
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,839
and this is one that a lot of people

1200
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,720
haven't heard of

1201
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,760
you can prov generally with udemy you

1202
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,319
can

1203
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,880
purchase access to a course but if you

1204
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,400
want to download that

1205
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,359
say and store it on your laptop

1206
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,240
most often with udemy you can do you can

1207
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,000
do that for mobile devices but as far

1208
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,160
as i know they don't have an application

1209
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,119
uh that will allow you to download it to

1210
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,319
a laptop or to a desktop pc

1211
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,359
pack allows you to purchase that and

1212
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,640
similar to udemy uh that matter of fact

1213
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,839
they offer a lot of the court

1214
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
a lot of the same courses that are

1215
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,880
available through you to me if you

1216
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,920
want to if you're looking for a

1217
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,079
particular one and want to hang on to it

1218
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,280
for a while

1219
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,599
you could possibly buy that udemy course

1220
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,440
through pack publishing

1221
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,920
but you're able to provide down actually

1222
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,880
download it

1223
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,560
as mp4 files and you can actually have a

1224
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,520
package

1225
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
of full training for generally for often

1226
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,880
not a lot of money

1227
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,079
i if you wait again you can probably

1228
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,319
find something on the ten dollar per

1229
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,599
course range

1230
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,200
and they do have uh black friday and

1231
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,520
a lot of sales or at least they have the

1232
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,960
last couple of years

1233
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,280
late in the year where i one point i

1234
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,240
think i got

1235
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,599
10 for 40 or something like that

1236
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,880
uh now the downside is that

1237
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,960
in packs case you may

1238
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,480
they may break up a single course into

1239
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,920
three or four different components and

1240
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,599
ask for you to pay for each section

1241
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,400
separately

1242
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,760
so the cost can mound up but

1243
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
if you if you time it right if you catch

1244
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,760
it catch them on one of their sales

1245
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,400
the price can still be quite reasonable

1246
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,440
and if you

1247
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,599
don't want to necessarily uh

1248
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,520
be attached to the internet all the time

1249
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,960
though that's not quite the problem that

1250
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,640
it used to be

1251
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
pact is one way to go you can purchase

1252
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,640
the offer also offer

1253
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,440
pdfs of what would normally be printed

1254
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,880
books that can be used

1255
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,359
for certification training or

1256
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,640
preparation

1257
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,119
so that is something else to be aware of

1258
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,160
they offer

1259
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,720
they also offer a monthly subscription

1260
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,400
it was

1261
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,800
9.99 i haven't checked it

1262
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,560
recently i mean in the last couple of

1263
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
weeks to know whether or not it's still

1264
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,040
that price or not but

1265
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,560
it is an alternative that you might want

1266
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,839
to investigate if you're looking for

1267
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,800
preparation for a particular security

1268
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,599
certification

1269
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,800
i will recommend several uh

1270
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,240
providers that are available through

1271
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,560
pact as well as udemy

1272
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,960
uh one is jason dion i've used his

1273
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,240
preparation

1274
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,560
for his materials to prepare for several

1275
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,319
certifications

1276
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,280
mike myers is both a trainer himself and

1277
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,240
owner

1278
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,280
of an outfit called total seminars

1279
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,200
and i found their products to be

1280
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,599
universally quite good

1281
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,280
and one that i have discovered

1282
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,240
relatively recently is thor peterson

1283
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,880
uh i'm actually using one of his courses

1284
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,720
right now to prepare for

1285
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,000
uh my next certification and

1286
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,079
i think he does a very good job as well

1287
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,000
so if you want if you're looking for

1288
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,359
someplace to start

1289
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,640
those names might give you

1290
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,559
someone to look for the downside about

1291
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,800
peterson is that he really only targets

1292
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,839
upper level

1293
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,440
uh certifications cissp cism

1294
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,400
cisa as far as i know he doesn't offer

1295
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,040
any

1296
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,839
lower level certification prep courses

1297
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,640
one more that i would like to mention is

1298
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,960
cyber and once upon a time siberia would

1299
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,720
have been a favorite

1300
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,200
uh they used to be and used to means

1301
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,680
maybe a year ago be famous for offering

1302
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,280
free training

1303
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,000
and they would charge you for

1304
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,520
certification to completion

1305
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,599
the way that a mooc might they've

1306
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,440
recently changed their business model

1307
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,000
because

1308
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,760
they've merged with some other training

1309
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,800
providers and they're now providing

1310
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,839
a wider range of training some of it

1311
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,480
obviously commercial but they've also

1312
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,319
increased their price to about 49

1313
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,400
dollars a month per subscription

1314
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,760
or 400 a year you can you may be able to

1315
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,599
find it during specials for a lower

1316
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,720
price

1317
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,520
but it's no longer universally free for

1318
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,280
anything that they offer

1319
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
and a lot of their good certification

1320
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,880
prep courses now

1321
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,839
uh required payment of a fee i don't

1322
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,839
recommend them as highly as i used to

1323
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:52,880
but

1324
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,000
they're still a lot cheaper than uh

1325
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,559
most of the formal training from

1326
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,400
certification providers

1327
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,280
so it's worth at least knowing about a

1328
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,119
couple of people that i'll mention is

1329
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,920
would include kelly handerhand i used

1330
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,319
her

1331
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,040
uh training class to prepare for the

1332
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,319
cissp

1333
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,599
or in my case cisso uh

1334
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,559
last spring and it was quite good i

1335
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,359
caught i got

1336
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,520
i was able to take it right before it

1337
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,559
got moved behind

1338
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,280
i guess you'd call it a pay wall and i

1339
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,800
recommend it very highly it was the best

1340
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,359
cissp prep course i took and as i

1341
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,200
mentioned that also includes kevin henry

1342
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,839
who

1343
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,400
developed the training for ise squared

1344
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,960
and hand her hands courses are usually

1345
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,480
i've never i've never taken one that i

1346
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,640
didn't like and i've taken several

1347
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,720
and another gentleman i'd like to

1348
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,680
recommend i mentioned ed amaroso before

1349
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,119
uh he is now and is a professor at

1350
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,000
nyu new york university but he also has

1351
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,839
a couple of courses available

1352
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,720
available through cybury that i would

1353
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,079
expect would be very very

1354
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,160
worthwhile uh i think one of them is a

1355
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
for preparation to become a ciso or siso

1356
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,800
and the man is definitely qualified to

1357
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,319
address that topic

1358
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,079
last but not least this is something

1359
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,000
that the uh

1360
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,880
staff on our help desk turned me on to i

1361
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,640
don't know about a year ago when i was

1362
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,079
starting to put together this

1363
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,359
presentation and that's professor messer

1364
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,960
uh the advantage that that professor

1365
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,480
messer's courses have is that they're

1366
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,680
free

1367
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,000
not only does he offer for example

1368
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,800
security plus training he also offers

1369
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,119
i believe a plus and network plus

1370
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,240
training if you're interested in

1371
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,160
something like that

1372
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,680
but he also offers uh

1373
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,440
free study sessions online study

1374
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,160
sessions where people can meet and

1375
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,400
exchange ideas and discuss

1376
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,440
uh topics that they've gone over in

1377
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,480
that week's lecture uh the courses are

1378
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,720
available for free he makes his money

1379
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,760
by selling access to training notes and

1380
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,440
study questions and things of that

1381
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,040
nature

1382
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,920
and his material is surprisingly good

1383
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,280
given the fact that

1384
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,119
he's not charging for it i mean you

1385
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,319
can't it's hard to be

1386
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,119
free for free for price and if you're on

1387
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,480
a tight budget

1388
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,400
uh looking for a place to prepare for

1389
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,800
one of these lower level certifications

1390
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,280
definitely check this guy out uh there's

1391
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,680
a link to his website in the slides

1392
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,119
uh you can you could probably navigate

1393
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,160
from there to

1394
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,000
find some of the other certs but i

1395
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,680
actually recommend him quite highly

1396
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,559
and have recommended him to other people

1397
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,119
that

1398
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,119
in our in our team that are looking to

1399
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,000
get certified

1400
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,359
to wrap up and summarize what we've

1401
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,880
covered

1402
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,000
uh i hope i made the point that security

1403
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,839
credibility is a combination of

1404
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,240
experience and credentials

1405
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,319
if you just have the credentials but

1406
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,599
don't have the experience

1407
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,839
that's not going to be as valuable as if

1408
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:04,880
you've got both

1409
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,200
if you've been a security if you've been

1410
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,880
an assistant administrator

1411
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,079
or a network administrator for a couple

1412
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:12,960
of years

1413
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,559
you've got some if you've got some

1414
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,960
technical skills under your belt

1415
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,400
that's going to make the credentials a

1416
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,640
whole lot more valuable than just having

1417
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,160
just being a paper tiger

1418
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,839
and having a certification to hang on

1419
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,319
the wall

1420
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,160
credentials both the degrees and

1421
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,079
certifications they complement

1422
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,559
experience but they do not replace it

1423
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,480
so just you shouldn't think of a

1424
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,800
certification training course

1425
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,160
if something is going to teach you

1426
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,880
skills it's going to help you emphasize

1427
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,359
skills that you've already developed

1428
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,880
because that's what employers are really

1429
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,839
going to be looking for

1430
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
i maintain that systems and networking

1431
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,359
experiences is

1432
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,079
essential for security work because

1433
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:54,880
those are both

1434
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,000
parts of the part a large part the

1435
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
assets that we as security professionals

1436
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,800
are protecting

1437
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,839
and obviously things like patching

1438
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,920
hardening and configuration skills

1439
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,319
can be reinforced and enhanced with

1440
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,079
security certifications

1441
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,160
because the skills you've acquired along

1442
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,119
the way

1443
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,400
could be can be documented uh

1444
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,160
and you can you can be shown you know

1445
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,520
how to apply them

1446
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,960
uh to security work

1447
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
last but not least even after your

1448
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,640
career is launched you're going to need

1449
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,440
to learn

1450
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,599
continuing education and continuing

1451
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,240
education credits most certifications

1452
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,839
with a few exceptions that i've

1453
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,160
mentioned require them

1454
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,839
for example for comptia cert you're

1455
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,200
going to have to earn

1456
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,160
so many so many uh continuing education

1457
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,040
hours

1458
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,440
per year for three years in order to

1459
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,960
renew your certification

1460
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,520
you're also going to have to pay a fee i

1461
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,640
think it's 50

1462
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,800
per year the number of uh ceu credits

1463
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,240
varies from certification to

1464
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,920
certification

1465
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,440
and i hope you know that learning never

1466
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,760
stops uh

1467
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,599
the fee the reason that continuing

1468
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,920
education requirements exist is

1469
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,520
well partly to make sure that there's a

1470
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,760
continuing income stream for the

1471
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,599
certification providers i'm

1472
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,160
too much specific not to believe that

1473
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,200
but it's also

1474
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,920
to help keep people engaged in learning

1475
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,800
and

1476
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,000
new developments in the field so i

1477
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,079
hopefully

1478
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,079
this this brief chat can serve as an

1479
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,280
introduction

1480
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,079
or for a reminder for some of you some

1481
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,960
excellent low-cost means of learning

1482
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,480
and i believe we've got hopefully we've

1483
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,839
got a little bit of time left and we'll

1484
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,599
be available for questions

1485
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,680
thank you
