1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,960
hey everyone uh thanks for joining my

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,120
presentation uh red teaming without red

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,000
teaming

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,320
i appreciate uh everyone giving me the

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,360
opportunity

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,400
uh first and foremost i'm nick regelman

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,799
uh i'm a senior uh information security

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,920
analyst

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,080
i wear many hats even though i am not

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,680
wearing a hat currently

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
and i'm not wearing a hat in the picture

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
some of those hats are incident response

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
vulnerability management security

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
awareness and i think i

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,119
rules with a z it's always with a z and

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,880
i put that anywhere that i can whether

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,320
that's a printer

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,600
whether that's a server in the data

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,239
center but really i just put nick rules

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,520
on everything that i can

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
because my name actually auto corrects

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
to beef woman

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
so with that said i want to make

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,879
something very clear

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,079
before we start i am not

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
a red teamer uh i'm i'm not uh gonna sit

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
up here and try to pretend that i'm a

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,520
red teamer

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
sorry nothing against that um

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
i support the red team in their efforts

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
uh i think working closely in

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
vulnerability management

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
a red team really helps to emphasize uh

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
that not all of your vulnerabilities

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
have a cvss score

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
uh when starting a red team people like

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
to reference that pyramid of pain

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,720
uh which is it's very valid right

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,200
but how do you even get the building

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
permit to build that peer

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
that pyramid of pain uh how do you

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
create the foundation

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
to build the pyramid on uh this

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
presentation is really about advocating

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
for the existence of offensive security

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,280
programs

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
uh whether that's basic phishing pen

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,880
test red team

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
whatever and it's not even limited to

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
just security

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
you can use this just about anywhere so

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
sit back and enjoy it so what this

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
presentation is

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,960
not it is not about uber elite hacks and

55
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
it's not even technical in nature

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
what this presentation is though is how

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
to talk to people

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
and form those meaningful relationships

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
the idea for this talk

60
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
it actually came up a few years ago at

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
defcon it's as most of these talks

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
usually do

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
so i was i was talking with some people

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,318
and uh we were you know

65
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,399
of course afraid to discuss where we

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,480
worked uh

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
but over you know maybe maybe some

68
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
drinks and some time

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
we were talking about what we did for

70
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
work and the challenges

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
uh that we faced at the places that we

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,000
work

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
so some of the people we talked to they

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
had ideas to implement bug bounty

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,040
programs

76
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
uh others wanted to do red team and you

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
know there were actually a few

78
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
uh which kind of surprised me they

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
really just wanted to do simple

80
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
vulnerability scanning

81
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
uh they were they were all told no

82
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
you know for whatever reason you know

83
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
like oh so and so won't let me do this

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,720
and you know i wanted to understand like

85
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,519
why

86
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
and in these cases it really

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,319
wasn't what they were asking

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,280
but how they were asking for it and and

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
i'm going to try to keep this high level

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
and give you the pieces to put together

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
yourself but if you need help

92
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
uh you know it was something that

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000
applies to you specifically in your

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
organization feel free to reach out

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
and and i'll have contact info later on

96
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,840
so

97
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,800
every organization is different right we

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,760
all know that

99
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
um for that reason you know we have a

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
number of different frameworks that are

101
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
going to be available

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,080
uh it's not necessarily that one is

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
better than the other

104
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
it's that one may cater towar to uh a

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,599
particular organization

106
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,680
better than the other based on you know

107
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
industry

108
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
what your current security posture is or

109
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,879
really any other types of needs that you

110
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,760
have that you

111
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,440
that are unique to your business right

112
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
that's we already know that's

113
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,239
nothing new i'm not gonna i'm not here

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,440
to talk about that

115
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
i'm here to talk about where you begin

116
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
no one really talks about

117
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,440
where you actually start most of the

118
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
guides that you see online on on how to

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
build out offensive security programs

120
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
they cater to how you set your team up

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
and again

122
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,519
nothing wrong with that this is very

123
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,879
important and

124
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
like really any plan you really need to

125
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
take those into consideration when you

126
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
build the team

127
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
however that takes into the account that

128
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
you already know how to walk

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
that your organization already supports

130
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
the concept

131
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,399
how do we crawl first well in most

132
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,680
organizations

133
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
you simply have to ask for permission

134
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
and uh you know being a cowboy is really

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,440
fun

136
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
but when you accidentally shoot the

137
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,120
sheriff the town can get

138
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
upset so based on

139
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
many different conversations that i've

140
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
had

141
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
when you get an opportunity to ask for

142
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
something

143
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
a lot of the defcon conversations they

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
seem to have gone like this

145
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
hey i want to do this thing that we've

146
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
never done and i could potentially break

147
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,160
something

148
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
but i'm pretty sure i won't and and you

149
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,759
know

150
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
because you're responsible right you're

151
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
a responsible person and honestly you

152
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
probably

153
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,919
won't even break anything you know

154
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,960
there's a good chance that you won't

155
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,919
you're confident

156
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,639
that you can do this safely uh but think

157
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,160
about your executive

158
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
you just really made them confused like

159
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
you actually got the time with them and

160
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
now they are very confused at you

161
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
you see the confusion in their face so

162
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,919
you try to respond

163
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,080
dynamically you try to give them some

164
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
more context so you say something like

165
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
well it's pretty cool though because

166
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
you're gonna hack something

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,639
right i'm gonna hack something now what

168
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,400
is the average person

169
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
like what's their idea of hacking i know

170
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
that this is changing thank god

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,919
but um what what do people you normally

172
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,479
think

173
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,759
when you think about hacking uh csi

174
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
two people typing on the same keyboard

175
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
um certainly not mr robot

176
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,479
uh so it it pretty much

177
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
it's what they see in the movies right

178
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,680
that's that's normally

179
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,720
you know what they think i've been

180
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,520
hacking so you you hurry up and add in

181
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
but it's not like how they do it in the

182
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
movies so hey i want to do this thing

183
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,880
that we've never done and could

184
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,319
potentially break something but i'm

185
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
pretty sure i won't

186
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,759
but it's also pretty cool because i'm

187
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
not going because i'm going to hack

188
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
something

189
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
but it's not like how they do it in the

190
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
movies well congrats you

191
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,880
now made them scared and confused so you

192
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,319
got the double whammy

193
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
uh come back next year uh if you're

194
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
lucky

195
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,600
so all joking aside where do you

196
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
actually begin

197
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
you actually get you know you want to

198
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
get that time

199
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
so when you have an ask they actually do

200
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
something well

201
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
it really comes down to one thing and

202
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,560
and it's

203
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
hard to get in a lot of cases and it's

204
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,360
exceptionally easy to lose

205
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,400
and uh if if i was in a room with people

206
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,960
which

207
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
we can't i can't be for some weird

208
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
reason i don't know why but

209
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,919
and anyone want to guess what what that

210
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,520
would be and this is when you know

211
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,639
someone goes

212
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,919
trust right um trust that's

213
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,400
the basis like that is the foundation

214
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
for everything no matter what it is you

215
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,880
want to do

216
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
uh whether that's you know red team

217
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
offensive security

218
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,759
uh even if you just want to do something

219
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,039
for the business that has nothing to do

220
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,599
with i.t

221
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,000
it's all based on trust so how do you

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
build that trust

223
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,919
well you don't light a turtle on fire if

224
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,440
if that's what you're thinking

225
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,599
that's not how you uh you build the

226
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280
trust um

227
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
really i use that image because

228
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,840
is has anyone ever been are you familiar

229
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,880
with the the term

230
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
slow burn if if people

231
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,199
are like avid readers you may be

232
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
familiar with the with that term uh it's

233
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,880
really

234
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
something in storytelling it's it's a

235
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,199
story that doesn't try to rush itself

236
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,000
uh it doesn't try to escalate for no

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,039
reason

238
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
just to make it within like the 90

239
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
minutes or however many pages

240
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
uh it takes its time getting to the end

241
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,039
it's not really in a rush and

242
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,240
it's intriguing uh to be set up it has

243
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,000
some good characters

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
you know there's some drama along the

245
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
way i'm not here to sell you about a

246
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
slow burn but i'm just saying that's

247
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
what a slow burn is

248
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,319
uh people get invested in that story so

249
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,800
who are the characters in the slow burn

250
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
that that is the business

251
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
well depending on your organization

252
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
there really can be many different

253
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
characters here and their styles really

254
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
can vary a lot you know

255
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
remember they're characters so no two

256
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,520
are exactly the same

257
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,039
however there could be some similarities

258
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
and usually the ones that are decision

259
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
makers

260
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
they operate in a very common way so

261
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
let's think of your executive right

262
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
well for most people they think of a

263
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,919
person right

264
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,600
and they're behind a desk and picture

265
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
a person behind a desk i i think i did

266
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
an accurate representation of the image

267
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,080
here

268
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,279
and picture a bunch of levers

269
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,640
all around them and each one of those

270
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,279
levers

271
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,440
does something and yes one of them can

272
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
launch you out of your chair

273
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
through the roof out of the building now

274
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
why do they have all these levers

275
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
and by the way those

276
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
are levers those those are not bongs uh

277
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,440
if you

278
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
i have very poor art skills if you have

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
an executive who sits in their office

280
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,600
surrounded by a bunch of bongs

281
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
uh odds are you don't even need to get

282
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
to this point because they probably

283
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
thought what you said about hacking

284
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,760
earlier was wicked sick

285
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
so i just wanted to throw that out there

286
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
anyway the levers

287
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,040
they're there to prevent micromanaging

288
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
each one of these levers does something

289
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
and when they're presented with a

290
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
problem they really just want to know

291
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,120
which

292
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
lever they have to pull to fix it in a

293
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
very simplified term that's how a lot of

294
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,519
organizations operate

295
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
and it works so now that we know how

296
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
they generally operate

297
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
we can start to begin building that

298
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
trust right

299
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
so are there things

300
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,839
that could happen that could change them

301
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,200
from a person

302
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
behind a desk to a person

303
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
in an orange jumpsuit right

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,720
oh i can help that not happen i can help

305
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,040
you

306
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,680
not go to prison this is the lever you

307
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,959
have to pull

308
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,399
you need to start thinking in these

309
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,480
types of terms what is it that's

310
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,200
important to them obviously you know

311
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
not going to jail is is pretty important

312
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
uh and i'm not telling you to go into

313
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
your executive's office

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
and threaten them with jail time like

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
you're going to jail

316
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
probably not going to end very well for

317
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
you bad idea don't do that

318
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
think of opportunities though where

319
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,399
you're able to interact

320
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
with a person who's a decision maker

321
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
maybe they're not even an executive

322
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
maybe they're a mid-level manager

323
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
it doesn't matter you need to begin

324
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
building this trust at different levels

325
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,399
so you you're not even that person

326
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,160
that gets to talk to them find out who

327
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,440
that person is

328
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
talk to them gather data for whatever

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,519
problem it is that you're trying to

330
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,720
solve

331
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,160
and start small with that oh do you do

332
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
phishing campaigns

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
if not you really should because if you

334
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
don't know your company's click-through

335
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
percentage

336
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
i'm willing to bet that there's someone

337
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
else out there who does

338
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
what's that how are you supposed to know

339
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,519
what problems they want to solve

340
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
or what they're concerned with aside

341
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
from going to jail

342
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,760
we're all hackers here right at least at

343
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
heart you should know the answer to this

344
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
how do you know like what do they read

345
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
what are they reading wall street

346
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
journal business insider

347
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
forbes they have a list i don't know

348
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,079
anything about it

349
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,480
i'm not advocating for whether any of

350
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,760
these uh

351
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
businesses or publications write good

352
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
articles about infosec or even

353
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,040
how accurate they are all i'm saying is

354
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,959
whatever these types of publications are

355
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,079
talking about

356
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
is really what these executives are

357
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,399
reading so

358
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
what is that's what's on their minds

359
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
what it that's what they're concerned

360
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
with

361
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
you want to start a phishing campaign

362
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
find an article from something that you

363
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
know that they're going to

364
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
that they're reading and share it with

365
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,760
them via email add some context

366
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,480
interesting article about phishing have

367
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
we thought about conducting a campaign

368
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
to see where we are at

369
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
um you know don't just share that with

370
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,760
them because that's weird

371
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,040
you know there's a couple couple

372
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
managers in between you know what you're

373
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
going to want to do is you're going to

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
want to share that with your team as

375
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,680
well

376
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
the more people who you who you make

377
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,600
aware

378
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
the more informed they are and you're

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
going to be creating those dialogues

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,160
i'm not saying spam them with articles

381
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
every day or every week

382
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
just when there's something that can

383
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
kind of get those juices flowing

384
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,880
send it over remember it's the slow burn

385
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,160
it's not something that happens

386
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
overnight you're establishing that

387
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
dialogue and you're establishing that

388
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,560
credibility

389
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
start letting them know oh nick reads

390
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,200
the same stuff that i read

391
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
i i like him i'm gonna listen to his

392
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
crazy idea

393
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
like that happens so

394
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,880
use that to your advantage so

395
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
with that it kind of brings you into one

396
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,680
of my favorites and this is this is what

397
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,079
i call

398
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,839
the illusion of choice and uh

399
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,839
you can use this in so many different

400
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,480
ways and odds are you probably do it now

401
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,920
to some degree

402
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,120
uh so when i started my career

403
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,680
i worked in the it help desk for a few

404
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,639
different companies

405
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
and if you're starting out in the

406
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,920
industry like if you

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,279
if you want to get into security

408
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
offensive security you know anything

409
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,959
like that it's it's very broad

410
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,800
i still think that's a good way to get

411
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,000
your foot in the door at some

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
organizations and more importantly

413
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,240
you're able to get insight

414
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
into not only how processes work within

415
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,920
the business

416
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,480
but where those processes fail and then

417
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
you can you have opportunities to fix

418
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,959
them like

419
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,440
seriously if if you work in security and

420
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,839
you're not talking with your help desk

421
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
you're missing out on so many good

422
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
resources for information

423
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
and probably actually a decent talent

424
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
pool in in many cases

425
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
uh so anyway working help desk i'm sure

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,360
that there's at least a couple people

427
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
who can relate

428
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,040
um you're going to encounter

429
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,519
in in a help desk position many

430
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,480
different people

431
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
and some of them are going to get

432
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
hostile um

433
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,519
like i understand why there's some

434
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,519
frustrations here

435
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,320
it you know it doesn't make it right you

436
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
know i'm i'm

437
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,839
really big on treating people with

438
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,079
respect and and you know

439
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
berating people over the phone just

440
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,839
isn't you know the proper way to do it

441
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
but anyway it happens and

442
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,279
it happened to me rather quickly and

443
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,800
anywhere you go so

444
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,279
i created what i can really only

445
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,600
describe as a coping mechanism

446
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,839
uh that i call the illusion of choice

447
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,600
and really what this is is this is when

448
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,199
you present someone

449
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,240
with multiple options now if you're good

450
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
at this

451
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
you present the options in a way that

452
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
makes it very

453
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,000
obvious what the correct choice here is

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,399
and the second best choice should also

455
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,440
lead you

456
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,880
to the same outcome as the first choice

457
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
however just be prepared to implement

458
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
any choice that you offer them so be

459
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,160
careful

460
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,040
don't make it a choice of putting a

461
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,519
clear

462
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,880
dome over over a city uh

463
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
probably not not a good option so how

464
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
does this work

465
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
here's an example this is bob

466
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
now bob has a problem with his email

467
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
client right

468
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,279
so he calls the help desk and he gets me

469
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,199
or you you know who whoever you're

470
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
envisioning in this in this scenario

471
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
uh so you you know me or you answers the

472
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,480
call

473
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
and uh after a minute or two you know

474
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
he's describing his problem and you

475
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
figure out that you know based on what

476
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,120
he's talking about

477
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
it really just sounds like the the

478
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,399
outlook database is corrupted

479
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
and you really just you just recreate

480
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
the the profile and

481
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,240
download everything you know it it's

482
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
done you know

483
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,839
now bob doesn't like to be told what to

484
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,720
do

485
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,880
for whatever reason we're not it doesn't

486
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,160
even matter

487
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
why he doesn't like to be taught what to

488
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
do he just doesn't doesn't matter why

489
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,320
so how how do you actually do this well

490
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
this this is how i would respond because

491
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,519
this is someone who i ain't doing that

492
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
hey bob you know checking into this we

493
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,199
have a few different options here

494
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,360
uh the first here is i can just connect

495
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,320
in i can recreate your email profile

496
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
really that should be pretty quick you

497
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,279
won't even have to reboot or save

498
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,759
anything you won't lose any data

499
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,440
the other option is i could recreate

500
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
your entire windows profile

501
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,079
you're going to lose some settings it

502
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,279
could take a little bit

503
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,160
but i think it'll take care of it also

504
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
the third option i i suppose

505
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,720
we could re-image your machine uh that

506
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,079
might take a week or so

507
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,919
and if there's probably gonna be some

508
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,839
approvals and hoops to jump through so i

509
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,119
don't recommend going that route unless

510
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,559
we have to

511
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,240
so by doing this you're giving bob a

512
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
couple different options

513
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,640
and bob feels in control however

514
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,520
you stacked the deck in your favor bob

515
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
is likely going to choose the first

516
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,319
option

517
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,880
if not he's going to be inconvenienced

518
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
because he has to reboot

519
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
and save his work and no one likes to

520
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
reboot

521
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,039
no one like we all have solid state

522
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,919
drives now and

523
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
we can reboot in like 35 seconds in most

524
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
corporate images

525
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
but like we still don't want to reboot

526
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,799
anyway

527
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
uh he's inconvenienced if he doesn't

528
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
choose option one

529
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
and also pay attention to some of the

530
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,679
words that i used there

531
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
i i added some doubt with that second

532
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,039
option

533
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,080
i think it will take care of it it

534
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
doesn't matter what he chooses

535
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,760
because if he chooses one of those three

536
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,960
options i win

537
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,240
seriously look at it so option one

538
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,880
i get the call done i fix his stuff and

539
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,760
he's happy

540
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,600
he writes a good review because you know

541
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
we're not we don't count metrics on uh

542
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,720
on you know problem solved or anything

543
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,520
like that we

544
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
we we do it on like how many stars you

545
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
get or something

546
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
uh option two takes a little bit longer

547
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,919
because i had to recreate his profile

548
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,720
and

549
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
you know ultimately i just did that so i

550
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
could recreate his outlook database

551
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
you know it still gets fixed the guy's

552
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,799
happy i get a good review ori just

553
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
doesn't send one

554
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,760
option three right this is the wild one

555
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
i fought for him right wasn't approved

556
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,480
obviously

557
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
why would that be approved of course

558
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
it's not going to be approved it gets

559
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
denied because the mean supervisor won't

560
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
approve the rebuild request because we

561
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,080
didn't try

562
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,799
option one or option two so of course

563
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,080
they're gonna they're gonna shoot that

564
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,039
back down

565
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
so the caller he's not gonna be happy

566
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,720
with the supervisor

567
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,799
but they're happy with me because i

568
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,240
tried right

569
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
oh man that supervisor they're mean i

570
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
don't like them you

571
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
you're cool i like you i want to talk to

572
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
you next time i have a problem great

573
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,799
right

574
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,840
so i it's important that when you offer

575
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,080
an

576
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
option that's backwards you give

577
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,600
yourself an

578
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
out and and really the bonus to the

579
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
illusion of choice

580
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,320
is people love it they

581
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
love it when they feel like they're

582
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,559
getting something special

583
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,720
if if you can use something like oh we

584
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
don't normally do this

585
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
or or you know kind of convey things a

586
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
little bit differently so they feel like

587
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,480
they're getting something special even

588
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,919
if it's a penny

589
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,880
it's still a shiny penny and they got it

590
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,160
and the other person who called in

591
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,559
didn't

592
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,640
they feel special so uh

593
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
this is this is gonna be a a little

594
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,760
story here

595
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
uh i used to sell shoes at a department

596
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,480
store

597
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,280
way back when i was i was the al bundy

598
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,840
it was

599
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
uh yeah it was an experience and and

600
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
that's a different talk for a different

601
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
time

602
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
but one of the things that the managers

603
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
did in this department store was they

604
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
gave us the authority

605
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
to discount 10 off of the price

606
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,120
so this was really if there was a scuff

607
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,440
or something cosmetic with the shoe

608
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
i use that discount for people somewhat

609
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
often like i would

610
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
i would actually say frequently uh you

611
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
know obviously yeah if there's a mark or

612
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
something on the shoe yeah here's 10

613
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
but if someone was genuinely nice to

614
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,679
deal with or they were buying multiple

615
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,240
shoes

616
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
something like that i'd just be like hey

617
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
you know you've been pretty cool and

618
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
you're buying a couple pairs of shoes

619
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
you know what i'm gonna knock an extra

620
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
10 off your uh

621
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,960
your price and they're like does that

622
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
include the sale price or like can i

623
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
still use my coupon like that's usually

624
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
their their main concern and if you can

625
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,960
say

626
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
well of course man they are happy

627
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,919
they are so happy do you know how many

628
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,679
of those customer service awards i got

629
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
as a result of doing that

630
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,799
so obviously we we are not

631
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,520
shoe sales people here like we don't

632
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,480
sell shoes

633
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
you know i i would imagine most of us

634
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
work in in security or some sort of a

635
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
technical role or at least trying to

636
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,880
attain that that type of uh job so

637
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,679
how do you do something special in your

638
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,159
organization

639
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,360
so really what i started to do is

640
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
i had something that i like to call the

641
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,400
rounds and this was uh this was

642
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,280
pre-covet obviously

643
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,240
and friday afternoon like no one wants

644
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
to start anything new on a friday right

645
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,799
like you uh how many people are starting

646
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,240
some unless there's an incident

647
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,919
like after like two o'clock friday i'm

648
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,280
not starting anything new

649
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
you know i'm working on email cleanup

650
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,720
documentation that type of stuff but

651
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
anyway

652
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
um friday afternoons i would walk around

653
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
the campus

654
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
and i would visit different teams that i

655
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,159
work with you know people who i'm

656
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
i'm asking to do work i'm asking them to

657
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,360
do something

658
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,320
and i i would really just be like hey

659
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,600
what's going on because at first they

660
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,720
would see me come and they would like

661
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,919
kind of scatter

662
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,919
like the only way i can describe it is

663
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,600
like lifting up a rock like a big rock

664
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
and seeing all the bugs scatter like oh

665
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
no it's the sun

666
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
uh that's what it was like oh we

667
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,000
we better we better scram regelmans here

668
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
uh

669
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
but after a while like they they found

670
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,520
out that i wasn't

671
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
showing up to try to give them work i

672
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
was just showing up to

673
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,320
just to talk to them hey what's going on

674
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
you know just just to just to bs with

675
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
them a little bit and

676
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,679
and you know you might be like you you

677
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,280
walked around and bs

678
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
with different teams instead of doing

679
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
work yeah

680
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,559
you'd be surprised how much work i get

681
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,880
done um

682
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,280
so we would end up having these like

683
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,880
impromptu meetings i would just be like

684
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,679
oh wow

685
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,280
what are you guys working on or you know

686
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
what's a problem you guys have

687
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
and and we would just talk about

688
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
different things that they're thinking

689
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,159
about

690
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,400
and we would end up like bolting

691
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
security on

692
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,280
really early in their processes and

693
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
actually improve our overall posture

694
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
just by walking around on a friday

695
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,919
afternoon talking to different teams

696
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,120
so people liked this because they didn't

697
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
associate me with work

698
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
as a result remember like you come home

699
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,159
you have a dog

700
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,080
and your dog's real excited to see you

701
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
when you come home

702
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,679
probably because you're a good person

703
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
he's probably going to be let out

704
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,200
and maybe they're going to get fed so

705
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
they're very excited to see you when

706
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
they come home they associate you with

707
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,120
happiness

708
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
right same thing happens at work if if

709
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,640
you

710
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,200
are just hammering people with work

711
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,720
making their life difficult

712
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,919
people aren't going to like you and

713
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,360
you're going to have a hard time winning

714
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
them over

715
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
so all if all you do is create work for

716
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
other teams

717
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,919
it's important very important that you

718
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,039
do something to keep

719
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,080
the relationship in a good balance do

720
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,520
you have any pizzas

721
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,360
i've bought in the past two years that

722
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,799
that weren't for me

723
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,720
it'd be a lot more if they were for me

724
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,200
because i i really like pizza

725
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,240
um it's my password uh

726
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
but it like if your team is doing a

727
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,880
bunch of like pen test remediation work

728
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
here are some pizzas thanks for your

729
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,159
work

730
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
or uh you know because they're not going

731
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
to associate with work they associate

732
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
with something positive

733
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,120
like pizza right so

734
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,440
this this extends even past the uh the

735
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,039
the friday

736
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,880
uh work around so

737
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
uh one of the things that i would do is

738
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
we would have a gym

739
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,120
and if you have a gym when you're able

740
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,799
to go back into the office

741
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,000
i encourage you to join that gym at

742
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,679
uh at work uh because it really helps

743
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,760
uh with stress and more importantly if

744
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
you start taking some of these classes

745
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,440
you can meet people on the business and

746
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
after a couple weeks

747
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,120
of sweating it out and just suffering

748
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
with these people

749
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
you're equals like it doesn't matter

750
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,000
what your job role is it doesn't matter

751
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
what you do

752
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
you lay on the floor and you sweat and

753
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
like cry at the end of that class at

754
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,080
p90x

755
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,120
just like everybody else so they they

756
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,559
can relate to you so when you're

757
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,919
actually interacting with those

758
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,760
different members of the business

759
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,799
that's very important uh that like take

760
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,000
advantage of those types of

761
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,880
opportunities a little bonus right there

762
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
so when you put this all together you

763
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,279
know look at the slow burn

764
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,240
that's trust is the fundamental driver

765
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,720
of

766
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
everything it's a slow burn because it

767
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
must be genuine to be effective you're

768
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
not going to build trust overnight

769
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,799
there's there's different things that

770
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
you can do and understanding the

771
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,960
concerns and creating those dialogues

772
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,279
are really an excellent starting point

773
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,360
to start to engage

774
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,400
uh the the decision makers without it

775
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,480
being forced without you know them

776
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
feeling like you're just coming to them

777
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,919
because you want something

778
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,480
if you can build a genuine relationship

779
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
with these individuals and you can do

780
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
this at any level

781
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
it's it's so rewarding and you're going

782
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,360
to accomplish so much in your

783
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
organization

784
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,600
and you also increase the trust that you

785
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,240
have

786
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
by increasing the circle of influence

787
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,799
remember it's the illusion of choice

788
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,320
it works well when you need to get

789
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,919
someone to do something

790
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,960
and they love special things as a result

791
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
of doing something

792
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,520
pizza whatever these people need to be

793
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
an extension of your team

794
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,880
so it's it's vital that you go

795
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
and you build out those uh that those

796
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
spheres of influence

797
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
so then that way you know they may they

798
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,520
may not be the manager of those teams

799
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
but those are the teams that are saying

800
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,760
oh yeah this guy you know i i really

801
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
like him i trust him

802
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
and you're gonna be like you're going to

803
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,960
find that it's a lot easier

804
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
to get things done or get things

805
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
accomplished

806
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,679
so once you start to gain that trust

807
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,200
you're you're going to want to start

808
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,799
small uh you know

809
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,919
you're not going to get a little bit of

810
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,600
trust to be like hey man we're doing red

811
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,240
team exercises it's gonna be brutal

812
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,360
hold on now that's that's probably a bad

813
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,039
idea you're gonna want to start really

814
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,919
small

815
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,520
uh fishing fishing is like so

816
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,279
so good to start off especially if you

817
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,600
don't have a security program

818
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
you do fishing already then you know

819
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,760
you're probably further along

820
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
um and and they may have some general

821
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
security acceptance you know your

822
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
executives

823
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
so so why not do a password audit at

824
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,159
that point excuse me

825
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
the other thing is words matter

826
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,919
especially now you know uh

827
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,480
red team might be a bad word where you

828
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,279
work

829
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,880
at your organization uh there may be

830
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,120
negative associations with the term red

831
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
team should there be

832
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
no there shouldn't but some people you

833
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,600
know

834
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
they they think of that as an attack

835
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,679
team which i mean by definition it is

836
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,760
so if you can't use red team or it makes

837
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,679
people feel uneasy because it's really

838
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,960
conservative

839
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,600
why not call it something else can't use

840
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,480
red team

841
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,360
controlled attack program right it's

842
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,720
controlled

843
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,919
because it's in the name it i wouldn't

844
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,360
put it in the name if it wasn't

845
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,480
controlled so you're

846
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,440
you're you're telling them at that point

847
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,559
oh yeah

848
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
that's not a red team that's cap that's

849
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,080
a controlled attack it's

850
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
everything is controlled you know

851
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,760
nothing's going to break

852
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
because that's that's their fear

853
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
breaking the business

854
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,080
um the the other thing with the words

855
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,520
they they matter so much

856
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,799
more now that we're remote um and it's

857
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,559
important that that when you're talking

858
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,000
to these people

859
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
that that you're speaking to them uh you

860
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,120
know

861
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
that you're not typing to them but if

862
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
you have an opportunity to do voice chat

863
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
or even video

864
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,159
if you can do video please just do video

865
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,679
it works so much better

866
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,080
you can talk with your hands and and you

867
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,679
can just convey certain things

868
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
and if you're on camera you can have

869
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,399
things that you can use as an ice

870
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,279
breaker

871
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,200
like this this stupid microphone right

872
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,559
here this right

873
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,000
i i've dubbed this since you know we

874
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
we've started going remote

875
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,120
i i've i've started to call this

876
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,679
the legitimacy maker like this right

877
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,399
here

878
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,559
this just adds legitimacy to whatever i

879
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
say because people are just like

880
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
what are you dj in a radio station

881
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,159
you're like yeah i

882
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,640
am and they're like oh okay like they

883
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
they think that this is

884
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
like it just adds it's like a it's like

885
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,679
a blue check mark on twitter

886
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,440
like people are gonna pay attention to

887
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,720
more of what you're saying

888
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,360
if you have like little trinkets and

889
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
like i don't mean little blinky things

890
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,159
behind you but like

891
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,279
just just little things like that that

892
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,240
you can use as an icebreaker uh

893
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
i people

894
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
when i meet them in meetings that's one

895
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,679
of the first things that they bring up

896
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,760
is is they is they're like oh look at

897
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
that microphone and i joke around about

898
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,840
it

899
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
you know things like that they're stupid

900
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,279
cheap and they're a really good

901
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,320
icebreaker and

902
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,159
right now if you can't do those

903
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,000
face-to-face interactions

904
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
it's best to try to do the the video to

905
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
video wherever possible i know that

906
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,200
people

907
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,840
hate you know being on camera and and

908
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,440
whatever and

909
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
i'll be honest i i do too because i

910
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
can't pick my nose or do whatever it is

911
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,399
that i'm gonna do with the camera isn't

912
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:24,960
off

913
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,760
um but you know it's really worth it

914
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
especially if you can't have that human

915
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
interaction that face to face

916
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,760
uh so i i can't emphasize that enough

917
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,799
that's actually one of the things that i

918
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,200
i took on and learned during quarantine

919
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
is like how do i still

920
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,360
you know effectively communicate and you

921
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
know just having the webcam

922
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,399
and you know the backgrounds or you know

923
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,760
a lot of people comment on like mortal

924
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,440
kombat in the background something like

925
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:51,919
that

926
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,760
you know just good ice breakers you know

927
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,240
to start conversations with people

928
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
um so if you're looking for some helpful

929
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,360
resources

930
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,640
and i am not trying to shill anything

931
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,440
here

932
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,039
uh take it leave it you know whatever

933
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,720
these are things that have actually

934
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,399
helped me a lot in my professional

935
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,279
development

936
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
if you think you can talk to people and

937
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
you're good at presenting seriously take

938
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,159
up one of these classes you're gonna get

939
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:16,640
better

940
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,120
like you're never going to be as good as

941
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,919
you can be

942
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,039
like you can always do better um

943
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,320
you know gaining that trust and

944
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
expanding my professional network

945
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,679
uh both of these uh these books

946
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,880
really helped to to do that um

947
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,799
you know it might be kind of a bad

948
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,559
example because we're sort of in a in a

949
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,760
pandemic

950
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200

you were giving presentations on just

954
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,159
about anything you know multiple times

955
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:48,559
