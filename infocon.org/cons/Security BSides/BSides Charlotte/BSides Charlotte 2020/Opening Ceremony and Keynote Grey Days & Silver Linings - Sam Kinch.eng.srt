1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
everybody for showing up today uh if

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,439
you're joining us here in

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,279
charlotte uh it's kind of some cloudy

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,880
drizzly weather today

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,920
so today seems like a great day to get

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,599
your cyber on and join us

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
for b-side charlotte so thank you very

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,600
very much for showing up today

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
so as you know this is community based

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
conference so there's really no reason

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
to do this if you're not here with us

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
and

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,199
today from a speaker lineup and a topic

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,000
standpoint we

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
have a pretty wide range that covers

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
offensive and defensive

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,280
uh topics as well as some satellites

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,960
some hospitals

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
some ransomware and more more than that

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
so should should be a little bit of

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,480
something for everybody in

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
in today's lineup and speaking of that i

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
wanted to point out that in spite of

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,480
some of the challenges that

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
this year has brought this is something

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,079
we've still been able to move forward

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,719
with

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
which which is a very positive thing uh

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,359
and not only have we been able to move

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,719
forward with it but we've

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
really been able to even expand the

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
scope of the conference

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,680
to include attendees from across the u.s

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
and possibly even outside of it and not

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,799
only that

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,280
but we've also had speakers submit from

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
around the globe

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
and one of them is actually uh

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
it'll be a very very late evening for

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
them when they they join us for their

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
presentation q a

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,840
so we're very very thankful to all of

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,720

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,600
uh submission uh submitters as well as

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200

a huge shout out uh and thanks for that

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
so moving right along there's a couple

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
of logistics things i wanted to cover

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,320

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,119
little bit more

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280

shortly and let's just make sure we get

198
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,799
a positive before i move forward on that

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,080
all right

200
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,919
alex or somebody else can i get a thumbs

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
be good awesome all right fantastic so

203
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,479
this uh this talk

204
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
um even though we're virtual uh this

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
seems to be the the name of the day

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
for for how we do business so that's all

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,199
fine

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
um it's uh it's relevant i think and i

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
think it'll apply to

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,599
being both a an awareness perspective

211
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,639
for some of the things that i've been

212
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,599
involved with

213
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
uh most currently as well as kind of uh

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,440
looking forward trying not to associate

215
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
the the bad stuff that's happening with

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,000
great a's but

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
to look at the silver linings that are

218
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
going to be happening and that are

219
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,759
already happening

220
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,960
uh throughout the world uh so with that

221
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,159
let's get into the slides

222
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
it really helps to understand who i am

223
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
i'll just level set the playing field

224
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,039
um i tend to hide in the background a

225
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,039
lot when it comes to hacks for charity

226
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,520
and that's just uh the way i feel most

227
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
comfortable i like doing stuff i like

228
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
hacking

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
um and an ode to johnny long i'm going

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
to kind of play through a bunch of

231
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
slides

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
fairly quickly i'm not going to have

233
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
much detail on the slides and i think

234
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
this will uh

235
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,479
this will get through at least the intro

236
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
part and then once you know who

237
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
and where i'm coming from it'll help

238
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,280
kind of unders you'll

239
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
have a better clarity on my approach and

240
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,120
why i'm talking about what i'm talking

241
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,919
about

242
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,919
so absolutely i'm a hacker by trade i

243
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,199
love this stuff i've been doing it since

244
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,160
i was a child

245
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,759
uh most recently with hackers for

246
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
charity as you heard in the intro

247
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,440
i am a warrior when it comes to the

248
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
military i've been doing so for for many

249
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,799
many years

250
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,719
i'm also a traveler and courtesy of the

251
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,080
military they like to ship you off to

252
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,919
random fire places in the middle and

253
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,560
in rare and places i probably will never

254
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
go back to again

255
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
um but those are good experiences and

256
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
they they definitely helped

257
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
mold who i am today i'm a husband my

258
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,480
wife

259
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
four children as well so i'm a dad and

260
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,480
that makes things very complicated

261
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,519
especially when they're all

262
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,680
teenagers and below and then i'm a

263
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
christian by trade

264
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
and by uh fundamentally by the way i do

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
business so

266
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,920
i feel like that really does impress

267
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
upon my life

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
the decisions i make how did i get to

269
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,800
where i'm

270
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,359
at today

271
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
29 years ago i started with the military

272
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
i started off with the army

273
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
it was a uh tanks bradley's overseas

274
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
bosnia sco uh

275
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
macedonia kosovo war all that time that

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
crisis back then

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
but i didn't really want to stay in the

278
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
army uh i wasn't married at the time it

279
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
was a lot of fun but then

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,040
around 2002 i started looking into

281
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
another career i wanted to fly but the

282
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,240
army wouldn't let me fly

283
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
so i switched over in 2002 to the air

284
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
force

285
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,880
the air force provided me an opportunity

286
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
to be a c-130 pilot

287
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
and i ended up flying for for many many

288
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,399
years and again

289
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,560
they sent me overseas that i ended up in

290
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,519
africa

291
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,800
middle east uh afghanistan pakistan

292
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,519
a lot of iraq and this was just in the

293
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,279
2005 time frame

294
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
so not too long ago but things have

295
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,200
changed a lot since then as well

296
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
38 was the number of years ago that i

297
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
transitioned i would say i started

298
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,920
gaining

299
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,000
i shouldn't say transition but gained a

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,680
love for cyber

301
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,519
um so i transitioned at some point with

302
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,120
the air force i transitioned from being

303
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,519
a c-130 pilot to being a cyber geek

304
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
and i started that uh when i was a child

305
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
i actually ended up taking a c

306
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
bus class when i was in middle school of

307
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,480
all things

308
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,800
and i can reflect back on that and i

309
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
know that that was fundamentally

310
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,920
where i started my passion for for cyber

311
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
but the air force also had other

312
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
opportunities for me and so this is how

313
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
i ended up getting

314
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
the cyber warfare arena uh i was bracked

315
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
for those non-military that means

316
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,399
our base was shut down and you're forced

317
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
to go find a new job some other place

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
thankfully in delaware they were

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
standing up a cyber operations squadron

320
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,839
and that operation squadron is focused

321
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
on offensive operations so it was really

322
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
awesome and it really tied me

323
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
um to something that i loved so now my

324
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,360
military career

325
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
and my love and passion in life were

326
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
converging this was really cool this is

327
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
also that around the time

328
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
early 2000s or middle 2000s that i met

329
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
some fantastic people that

330
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
drastically influenced my life folks

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
like rob fuller at mid-atlantic ccdc

332
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,880
the national or the nsa cyber defense

333
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,160
exercise

334
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,600
johnny long and hackers for charity

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
these people played big parts in

336
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
developing who i am

337
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,040
i also started red teaming with raphael

338
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
mudge from armitage now cobalt strike

339
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
and so raph and i became friends through

340
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
that means

341
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
we've maintained that friendship since

342
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
and so that's really led to

343
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
a lot of opportunities in being an

344
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
advanced business and threat team lead

345
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
working with folks like don hess

346
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
and others that are um within our

347
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
military community

348
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
very avid on the red team blue team

349
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
sided house doing security assessments

350
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,800
yes uh but really enabling

351
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
younger generations as well as um

352
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
organizations to refine their processes

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
and become better at

354
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
defending our networks which is

355
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
fantastic and it's a lot of fun to do

356
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,040
then in 2008 time frame is when i met

357
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
johnny long

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,839
with a hackers for charity but at the

359
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,440
time he was working for a defense cyber

360
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
crime center

361
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
uh and that's where the ties started

362
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
there and i started volunteering and

363
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,360
supporting and engaging with hsc

364
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
i ended up doing a lot more cyber uh

365
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,720
whether it's

366
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,000
one job or another i stayed in the cyber

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,639
arena

368
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,800
on the military side and then on the

369
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
personal side my passion's in love as

370
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,839
well

371
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,279
and i for for the record i am a

372
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,000
advisor a national guard advisor which

373
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,320
traditionally would mean that i am a

374
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,040
part-time a military member but i've had

375
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,760
the benefit

376
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,839
of being full-time even though i'm a

377
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,440
national guardsman

378
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
working for cyber command working for

379
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,560
the national guard

380
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,639
on on all things cyber and that's where

381
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
i'm at today so i'm the national guard

382
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,120
advisor to

383
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
the commander of u.s cyber command and i

384
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,279
also work on the defense science board

385
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
on projects such as jig which is

386
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
the future of joint cyber warfighting

387
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,240
what is the architecture going to look

388
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,680
like how are we going to fight these

389
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,279
battles in these wars from a cyber

390
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,720
perspective

391
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,440
more effectively with better technology

392
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
something that allows seamless

393
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
interactions

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,519
obviously thrown buzzwords like ai or ml

395
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
these are you know these type of things

396
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,519
are all being looked at as part of the

397
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,279
solution they're already being used

398
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,880
but are they the best way we're doing

399
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
business so fundamentally that's who i

400
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,519
am that's where i come from

401
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,800
it wouldn't be a conference without

402
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
starting off with midnick

403
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
so so one of the things this quote uh

404
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,959
we'll kind of set the stage for some of

405
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,000
those discussions we're going to have

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
today we talked about

407
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
gray days well when you look at hackers

408
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
there's been a transition

409
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
and we've seen this i wouldn't say a

410
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
transition within the hacker community

411
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,959
but hackers

412
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,639
you know they've gotten a bad rap and we

413
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
know that a lot of the

414
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,279
the background fundamental work behind a

415
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:09,839
hacker

416
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
is breaking stuff unfortunately what

417
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
we've seen in the last year

418
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,680
is a massive of breaking stuff

419
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,519
of big businesses state and local

420
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,199
corporations and federal government to

421
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,160
say the least

422
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
and it's becoming a big business in

423
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
other words people are making drastic

424
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,079
amounts of money

425
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
huge amounts of money doing this there

426
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,519
are actually regimes

427
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
maintaining um their regime status

428
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,199
because they are conducting ransomware

429
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,000
attacks

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,160
and then sucking that money in to prop

431
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,560
up those regimes

432
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
so what great days are we talking about

433
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
um when we talk

434
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,839
in the last year and i'm just going to

435
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,519
look over the last year

436
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,399
we've had some significant hurdles

437
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,199
obviously

438
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
with coven that is something that we

439
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,240
can't

440
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
underestimate um the impact it's going

441
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,680
to have

442
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,279
globally the the ability for it to

443
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,880
influence what it's doing on our future

444
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,240
what it's going to do and how it's going

445
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
to impact our lives

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
uh going forward it's fundamentally a

447
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,000
massive change to how we are doing

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,199
business

449
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,920
and it's not just impacted the you know

450
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,760
state the local the companies the

451
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,040
civilian organizations

452
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
i can tell you it's hugely impacted the

453
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,560
federal government and the way we're

454
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,680
doing business

455
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,920
the virtual nature the teleworking all

456
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,279
that stuff is now

457
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,079
forcing drastic changes into

458
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
corporations

459
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
uh way of doing business they're having

460
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
to change their security mentality from

461
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,240
a

462
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
you know every users in the building to

463
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
all of a sudden now you have all these

464
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,320
remote

465
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
systems all these teleworking

466
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,759
microsoft teams google meet all those

467
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,480
have been

468
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
hugely refined in the last year

469
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,880
i am still here but

470
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,360
i am tweaking my slide for a second

471
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
because it doesn't want to cooperate

472
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,560
okay civil unrest

473
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,279
well it wouldn't be a discussion without

474
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,399
that

475
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,920
this one has uh caused controversy

476
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,959
created um a real

477
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,120
tension around our nation you know you

478
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,279
think of cities like portland who are

479
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,440
succumbing to all kinds of

480
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,079
of protests in different fashions from

481
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,639
extreme side to the more benign side

482
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,320
and while this country is founded on the

483
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
ability for free speech

484
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
the civil unrest part of it it does

485
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
affect people

486
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,959
both emotionally physically it's all

487
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,600
over the news

488
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
the political agenda of today you know

489
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
we have elections coming up in a month

490
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,480
and this is another aspect

491
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,519
of the sensitivity where we see people

492
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,519
modifying the way they're doing business

493
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,199
we see them

494
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,760
placating to certain parties regardless

495
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,119
of what administration

496
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
ends up either staying in power or

497
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,039
taking over it's going to affect

498
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,160
us permanently because those changes

499
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
that those individuals and more so the

500
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
administrations make

501
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,400
are going to impact us for the long haul

502
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,839
and we know that i mean this is not

503
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
something that's new or

504
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,359
or different from before

505
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
finally i want to talk about ransomware

506
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,559
i'm going to go into a lot more detail

507
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
on this because i think there's a tie in

508
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,960
here

509
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
where i can highlight a bunch of of

510
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
silver linings that have been happening

511
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
within at least u.s cyber command and my

512
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,840
work with them

513
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
over the last year where we've been able

514
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
to play

515
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
and help states and localities

516
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
help fight these malicious cyber actors

517
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,760
as i'll call them

518
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,080
and those can range from you know local

519
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
script kitties who are taking advantage

520
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
of that low-hanging fruit in states

521
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
or foreign nation states that are

522
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,760
purposely attacking

523
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
our country and we've been doing stuff

524
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,559
to actually mitigate that as well

525
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,240
you're aware of a lot of it and we're

526
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
going to talk about some of that today

527
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
so let's highlight some of the news

528
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
articles recently and then

529
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
what i'll do is i'm going to dig into

530
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,360
how we've been able to help some of

531
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
these organizations

532
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,520
and these are all snapshots from uh the

533
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
last couple days pulling from google

534
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,080
news feeds

535
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,799
uh back in may the first one the first

536
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,400
big one was texas department of

537
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
transportation

538
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
uh as well as their court judicial

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,960
system was hacked

540
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
a lot of the documents were pulled from

541
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
there and that really

542
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
uh for for cyber command was one of the

543
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
the bigger ones that we were able to

544
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
facilitate um

545
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,600
some of the new remediation efforts from

546
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,640
from our

547
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,480
federal side helping out a state

548
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
locality and you'll see that

549
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,799
the first day of school in connecticut

550
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
this was one that was really interesting

551
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,280
because

552
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,520
you know the ransomware managed to hit

553
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,240
server infrastructure that then just hit

554
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,200
um emergency services but also happen to

555
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
hit the school systems and so that first

556
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
day of school

557
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
they end up canceling it and starting

558
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,520
the next day

559
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
not a huge interruption but still when

560
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,400
you talk about the impact on the state

561
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,679
and of course the negative media

562
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,280
coverage doesn't help the situation

563
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,720
texas again uh in hamilton um emma ted

564
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
is another big piece of ransomware that

565
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,880
we're seeing

566
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
uh played out emma ryuk uh

567
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
conte ransom or uh ransom x is another

568
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,799
one

569
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,440
and texas will will mention tyler

570
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
technologies just a couple days ago

571
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,080
massive provider of software and

572
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,559
services for state and localities

573
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
and yet now they're hit by a ransomware

574
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
attack we're hoping it doesn't impact

575
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
uh beyond the company even though that's

576
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that's a real negative uh

577
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
you know that the fact that they could

578
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,520
potentially be impact

579
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
uh nation are not nations but states

580
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,960
around the united states

581
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,360
uh is a huge limitation that we're gonna

582
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,559
have to fight through

583
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,840
uh as organizations

584
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,679
if you look at if you look at texas for

585
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,520
example and you say okay

586
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,919
the fact that texas was ransomed okay

587
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,120
that's gonna happen

588
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,240
um but now you start throwing in media

589
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
and here's where the gray days get worse

590
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
because media will spin the situation

591
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,080
and start

592
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,640
raising concerns about hey this will

593
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,159
impact election security

594
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,720
hey you shouldn't trust our political

595
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,440
system

596
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
or our government is not capable of

597
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,280
defending themselves

598
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,919
these type of media hype is not a good

599
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,559
thing

600
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
but at the same time if we recognize it

601
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,000
for what it is i think we can read

602
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
between that and go okay

603
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,039
we're gonna fight through this and like

604
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,799
america typically does we will we'll

605
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,880
overcome

606
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
california it doesn't just hit home in

607
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
texas or connecticut like i mentioned

608
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
california had two weeks of school shut

609
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
down and delayed in rialto because

610
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,320
of disruption to their systems

611
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
and we talked about state and localities

612
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
this doesn't just impact them this is

613
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,120
also a

614
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,679
federal issue where you have federal

615
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,120
agencies in this case a

616
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
unnamed agency suffered a very

617
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
sophisticated possible nation state

618
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,159
attack

619
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,720
so these type of effects are are not

620
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,600
limited

621
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
to local localities within north

622
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,760
carolina or texas

623
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,600
or washington state but they are tied to

624
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,559
federal issues as well and our agencies

625
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,400
our federal government is not immune to

626
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
that

627
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
it's just to talk severity in statistics

628
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,760
if you look at this

629
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,880
47 increase in severity of ransomware

630
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
attacks

631
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,000
and that's on top of the 100 increase

632
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
from last year

633
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
so these type of things are not going

634
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,600
away in fact

635
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,919
i would say that they're effectively

636
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,960
getting much

637
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,520
worse um and as long as we keep that in

638
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,080
mind

639
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
as we talk and have those discussions

640
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
and and have the meetings with our

641
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
with our leadership and our discussions

642
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
to decide where we're going to spend

643
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
money

644
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
as long as we keep having those

645
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
discussions and keep a level heads

646
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
uh during them i think we'll we'll uh

647
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
we'll be much better off and much better

648
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,960
position to

649
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,919
be positive and find that that positive

650
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,640
outcome in the end

651
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
this quote is uh par for the course when

652
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,200
you talk about ransomware

653
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,520
ransomware attacks have

654
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,960
tended to be ones that ransom the

655
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,679
computer

656
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,480
lock down files tell you you need to pay

657
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,960
money

658
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
and then uh if you don't pay the money

659
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
they either

660
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,960
leave them locked up or they'll burn

661
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,600
down

662
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
in effectively in the virtual way the

663
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
networks or

664
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,280
um other ways of ransoming

665
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,480
um what we've seen play out in the last

666
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,280
little

667
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,480
few weeks has been a kind of a change in

668
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,960
some

669
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,159
uh tactics where the

670
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,200
ransom uh organization

671
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
will impact a or a company

672
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,080
or a state or locality they will exploit

673
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,640
them

674
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
they will drop their ransomware on the

675
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
system but they might

676
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
not encrypt files we've actually had

677
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,679
phone calls

678
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,440
and been able to get copies of phone

679
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
calls that were very interesting

680
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,240
that were from a paid for hire

681
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,520
person on behalf of the organization

682
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,600
that ransomed the the state or the

683
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,799
locality

684
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,039
uh leave the threatening note and say

685
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,159
listen you need to follow the

686
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,480
instructions on your desktop

687
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,760
and then if you don't then uh

688
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,440
we're gonna go ahead and we have your

689
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
information we're gonna go ahead and

690
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
release it

691
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
but they they haven't locked down the

692
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,520
systems yet so they're trying to

693
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,640
they're trying to keep those

694
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
organizations on the hook without

695
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
completely locking them down and causing

696
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
pain immediately

697
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
so it's kind of like a twist to it where

698
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,400
they keep that

699
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,559
that dangling threat above them in the

700
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,960
hopes that that organization will pay

701
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
and they really don't want to directly

702
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,960
impact because they want to

703
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,559
immediately because they do want to keep

704
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,000
making money from you the longer they

705
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,880
can suck

706
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,200
money out of your organization the more

707
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
they're going to

708
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,080
dangle that that carrot there

709
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,880
the way i see ransomware is is really

710
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
it's become the tick tock of malicious

711
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,120
cyber

712
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,520
actors the way they are actually doing

713
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,480
business

714
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,840
is it is so prevalent um and we've seen

715
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,120
it play out not just

716
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
like i mentioned before in the script

717
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
kitty side but in the criminal

718
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
actors as well as the nation state

719
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,000
actors they're all using it

720
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,360
and they're all using it very

721
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,080
effectively

722
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,679
so this is where i'm going to put on my

723
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,039
cyber command hat if we

724
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
if we if we just look at the negative

725
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
side of things um

726
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,880
you know that really brings us into a

727
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,480
position of

728
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,840
frustration of tension

729
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,279
and i know that there's a lot of

730
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,360
companies who are fighting back at this

731
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
you know pretty effectively malwarebytes

732
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
obviously bleeping computer other

733
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,080
organizations

734
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,360
all the mainstream you know mcafees

735
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,200
microsoft they're all doing actually a

736
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
really great work in trying to overcome

737
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,159
and defeat those type of actors but like

738
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,240
we know in cyber things change on a dime

739
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,679
within weeks

740
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,880
something shifted into a brand new uh

741
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,679
derivative of the previous work and so

742
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,840
we have to be on our a-game all the time

743
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
in order to stay ahead of that actor or

744
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,799
at least stay on par with that actor

745
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,760
the cyber nine line program was a means

746
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
for cyber command to gain awareness

747
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,159
for what's happening at state level and

748
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,520
i wanted to bring this to your attention

749
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
because a lot of people aren't tracking

750
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,240
on this program

751
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,159
it's new i started it in december of

752
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,520
last year

753
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
i was involved in red team exercises out

754
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
of new england there's six states that

755
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,799
conduct an exercise called cyber yankee

756
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
pretty massive exercise about 700

757
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,120
individuals all military

758
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,520
are focused on training their defensive

759
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
cyber operators

760
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,600
in the northeast to better their skill

761
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,159
set

762
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
in conducting everything from you know

763
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
secure protect type of ideas where

764
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
you're going into a network that's

765
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,559
compromised

766
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
figuring out what's wrong securing it

767
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,360
and then also trying to protect it

768
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,760
and mitigate future infections when i

769
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,000
was at these exercises and specifically

770
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
specifically the cyber yankee one i

771
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
noticed that there was not a means to

772
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,000
pass

773
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,960
information up out of the state up to

774
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
the federal level

775
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,360
and i'm concerned about the federal

776
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
level the state does a great job at

777
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,120
usually doing remediation in fact those

778
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,159
exercises

779
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,440
really highlighted the the share between

780
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
um localities or state level entities

781
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
um there are representatives from dhs

782
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,840
and fbi

783
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
a lot of times the state police will run

784
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
the operations center

785
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,520
uh and or the fusion center within a

786
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,640
state

787
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,840
response actions within the state albeit

788
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,559
they're all over the place are generally

789
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,440
really good

790
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
most states have some form of cyber

791
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
disruption plan

792
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,279
even if they haven't exercised it just

793
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,279
the thought process to have one

794
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,200
and and the ideas behind that is huge

795
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
that's that's a great thing

796
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
so the cyber nine-line program came

797
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,480
about because when you saw

798
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
general nakasone who's the commander for

799
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,480
general for cyber command was looking

800
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
across the nation

801
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,880
he was frustrated that he wasn't able to

802
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,919
get information

803
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,720
on state level action state level

804
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,399
incidents sooner

805
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840
cyber command from a mission perspective

806
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,480
has a responsibility to defend the

807
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
nation

808
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
and that's not an internal thing we rely

809
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,480
on our partners our mission partners

810
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,279
like dhs department of homeland security

811
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,799
or fbi or other sub

812
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,039
federal agencies like defense cyber

813
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
crime center and those organizations to

814
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,440
help

815
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
facilitate the internal

816
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,960
incident response our from cyber

817
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,240
command's perspective

818
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
our defend the nation perspective it's

819
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,760
outside the united states

820
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,159
it is how and this is general nakasoni

821
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:04,799
speaking

822
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,000
it's how do i persistently engage our

823
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,880
enemy persistent engagement is really

824
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,080
the fundamental

825
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,159
um words the buzzwords of choice and

826
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,520
those are all over the media when you

827
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,880
look at cyber command and look for

828
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
general naga sony if he's talking he'll

829
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,240
use those words

830
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
what he wants to do and what he's been

831
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,919
doing over the last year

832
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,960
is fundamentally fundamentally

833
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,360
changing the course of how we do cyber

834
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,080
warfare

835
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
within our nation it is actively

836
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
pursuing

837
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,720
our adversaries who are doing malicious

838
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,919
activities against us it is not sitting

839
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:40,320
back

840
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,520
waiting for an attack to happen and then

841
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
oh you know let me go ahead and figure

842
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,559
out who it was

843
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,720
go after them oh shoot i it's been a

844
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,159
couple weeks i've done my research i

845
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,440
know who it is

846
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
it is it's a lot different now it is

847
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,120
something where

848
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,559
we are constantly digging in to the most

849
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,880
simple incident response that is

850
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
happening within

851
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,880
our nation looking for trends of a

852
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,799
foreign nation-state actor

853
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,640
where maybe they are looking at a

854
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
particular weakness in a piece of

855
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,279
software

856
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,880
and we see them targeting several

857
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,200
different states with the same tactic

858
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
we also through other sources are able

859
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,640
to identify that

860
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,919
those that particular tactic is used by

861
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,120
a nation state like north korea or china

862
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,159
or russia

863
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,960
or anyone else out there for that matter

864
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
um

865
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,440
when we start putting those those

866
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,320
those um those things together those

867
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,039
incidents

868
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
and recognizing the trends that leads us

869
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,720
to pointing a finger at

870
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,080
a a malicious nation state who's

871
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,200
targeting our country

872
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
and going after us and this is where

873
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,919
cybernine line really plays its strength

874
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,440
we didn't really have a means to pull

875
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,120
that information in quickly

876
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,520
now if you look at the cybernine program

877
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,000
we are not trying to replicate what

878
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,840
other organizations do

879
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,360
in other words we're not trying to be

880
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
the dhs

881
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
for the federal government we rely

882
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
inherently that states are going to deal

883
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,159
with things

884
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,799
at the most local level possible they're

885
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,399
going to elevate things

886
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,520
up and out of their state when they feel

887
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
like they need help

888
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,240
and that's the way we should be doing

889
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,080
business our nation is founded our

890
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
constitution has a fundamental

891
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
uh premise that we are very

892
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,159
independently minded

893
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,320
in fact if you look across our nation

894
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
there's 50

895
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,200
different states there's dis

896
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
there's a district and there's multiple

897
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,240
territories

898
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,600
every one of those locations is unique

899
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
and different in the way they

900
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,279
stand up their operations center their

901
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,120
fusion centers their exchange of

902
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,039
information to who they're gonna talk to

903
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,279
maybe it's an isac maybe it's a

904
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,960
maybe it's their analyst in the state

905
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
maybe the state doesn't like federal

906
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,039
involvement and they don't want they're

907
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,720
very state-focused

908
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,279
and they don't want any federal play so

909
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,559
therefore they're not going to talk

910
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,720
outside of their state about incidents

911
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,559
and that's really okay what that's done

912
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,679
for our nation

913
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
is made it very difficult for malicious

914
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,240
cyber actors to target one state

915
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
and impact others which fundamentally is

916
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,080
amazing

917
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,200
that's a great strength to have um

918
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,360
if us actor really wants to pursue our

919
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,640
nation they're going to have to go

920
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,919
through

921
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,640
a unique method really for every state

922
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,519
that they want to attack

923
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,519
so the cyber nine-line program provides

924
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,559
a means to gain

925
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,880
information quickly from a state level

926
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
uh you see some of the bywords here of

927
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
non-sensitive we're not asking for the

928
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,840
company that was hacked

929
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
all we care about from a cyber command

930
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
perspective is what points us to the

931
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,320
enemy

932
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,640
foreign ips foreign domain names the

933
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,919
urls that are

934
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,799
uh that the implant is calling out to

935
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,640
pieces of the malware that were dropped

936
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,840
on your system

937
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
information about the actor who's

938
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
picking up the phone or the hired hand

939
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,960
that's picking up a phone and making the

940
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,399
ransomware threat

941
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,320
those type of things are hugely

942
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
beneficial for cyber command to look at

943
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,640
that

944
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
and and make take action on it we're

945
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,559
also

946
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,480
bi-directional this isn't a let's suck

947
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,919
up your information and not give any

948
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,200
information back

949
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,880
the one of the fundamental premises

950
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,559
behind this is that

951
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,039
as states um i say join the program

952
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,120
when they are able to acquire accounts

953
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
for our this program

954
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,559
without even sharing anything initially

955
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,320
we're giving them information

956
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
that is cyber command from cyber

957
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,559
command's big data platform our bdp

958
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,600
uh you'll have full access to and then

959
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
you can actually exchange uh poll

960
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,799
information out

961
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,960
you can exchange information with us via

962
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,320
cyber nine line

963
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,720
and uh we can start the conversations

964
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,840
for how to remediate

965
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
those type of uh the incident whatever

966
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,279
cyber incident

967
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,720
that's happening right now within your

968
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,559
state and i say it's

969
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,240
it's focused on the national guard and

970
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,080
that's because there's over 4 000

971
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
national guard

972
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,880
across 54 state district and territories

973
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
that live eat and breathe in those

974
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,159
states

975
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,559
those individuals are cyber trained

976
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,480
assigned to cyber command

977
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,960
and mobilize in support of those of

978
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
cyber command's efforts so they're

979
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,240
trained to do those defensive and

980
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
offensive missions

981
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,200
and therefore they're in a great

982
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,360
position to actually have access

983
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
and create a bridge between the state

984
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,519
national guard itself

985
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,760
and the state leadership the political

986
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
leadership there

987
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,519
either the civilians or the contractors

988
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,320
or even

989
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,360
the governor themselves

990
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,880
it really helps to play out what the

991
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,640
incident is

992
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
so if you look at an incident i'll go

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,760
through this really quick uh

994
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,039
let's say an incident happens in the

995
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,559
state of hawaii a mission element

996
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,960
responds a cyber task force might be

997
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,760
stood up

998
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,679
these are not military specific this is

999
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,880
just the state and the way they're

1000
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
responding whether civilians or military

1001
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,360
it doesn't really matter this is just an

1002
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,519
overview of how that might look

1003
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,600
there's a joint operations center and an

1004
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
emergency operations center within a

1005
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
state there's also fusion centers once

1006
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
the state elevates that

1007
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,120
that issue to a higher level it could

1008
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
get pushed out and this is the typical

1009
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,639
means for doing so it goes out to dhs

1010
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,040
their new term of art for their op

1011
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,119
center is now called cisa central

1012
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,040
so if you're part of dhs i don't think

1013
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,719
that was the smartest name but

1014
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,918
that is what you're calling it and

1015
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,239
that's fine you do have threat hunt

1016
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,879
teams at dhs that actually do response

1017
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,159
actions within

1018
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,079
uh states to help them remediate and

1019
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,520
this is only when the state actually

1020
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
elevates it to that level

1021
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,560
um and sometimes the states will employ

1022
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,839
their state national guard and those

1023
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,280
national guardsmen will go in their

1024
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,199
cyber forces they can go in and help

1025
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,280
assist the state they're usually

1026
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,918
supporting they're not usually the lead

1027
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,918
but the states are all different and

1028
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,520
again some states will use them and some

1029
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,639
states won't

1030
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,440
what had been left out of this exchange

1031
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,879
was cyber command

1032
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
for the longest time we just were not

1033
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
getting information quickly

1034
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,040
yes information flowed from dhs to cyber

1035
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,520
command

1036
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,040
it just took a while so we created the

1037
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,800
cyber nine-line dashboard

1038
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
um and while that's not really the meat

1039
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,560
you can see some of the takeaways

1040
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,680
um of what why we created the dashboard

1041
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
and kind of the benefits of having

1042
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,960
access

1043
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
it just gives you a highlight of what's

1044
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,560
happening around the nation but then you

1045
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,040
can dig

1046
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,520
into each incident and in that incident

1047
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,720
is how we are responding

1048
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,280
so before i go into texas i'll uh i'll

1049
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,160
say that

1050
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,839
the fundamental premise behind the

1051
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,280
program is twofold

1052
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,040
we are giving access to the states to

1053
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
better their state cyber self-defense

1054
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,880
and then we are also looking for

1055
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,079
information

1056
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,520
um iocs of indicators that will point us

1057
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,359
to those malicious cyber actors

1058
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,000
so that we as cyber command can take

1059
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,880
action within

1060
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,320
hours if not days um not

1061
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,440
weeks and months later when most likely

1062
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,560
the actors moved from their

1063
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,320
infrastructure and gone on to bigger and

1064
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,280
better things

1065
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,920
and by that time it's way too late so

1066
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,720
let's talk some

1067
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,760
examples texas was a really interesting

1068
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,320
one

1069
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,040
because it involved a push of

1070
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
information

1071
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,280
that happened from cyber command down to

1072
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,119
texas in part of their response and

1073
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,079
here's how it played out

1074
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,440
texas was succumbed by ransomware back

1075
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,079
in may

1076
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,760
it hit their county courts in their

1077
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,440
department of transportation

1078
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
they were responding to it internally we

1079
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
at cyber command

1080
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,520
have additional and i'll say classified

1081
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
means for gaining access to other

1082
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,640
information

1083
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,839
around the world whether it's dark web

1084
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,480
forums

1085
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,040
or other things that point us into

1086
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,560
things that are happening so we can see

1087
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,640
trends so we can highlight what uh what

1088
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,720
attacks are forthcoming what attacks are

1089
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,680
happening

1090
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,440
and in one of the particular exchanges

1091
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,119
between cyber actors

1092
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
malicious cyber actors on one of these

1093
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,480
forums

1094
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
there was a yara rule that was

1095
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,760
identified as being something that could

1096
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
mitigate the threat that texas was

1097
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,040
actually in the midst of

1098
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,079
of of dealing with and they were

1099
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,240
constantly getting still getting hit

1100
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,920
so cyber command was able to identify

1101
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
the cr rule they ripped it apart they

1102
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,119
verified

1103
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,119
its authenticity they actually tested it

1104
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,760
against systems in our networks

1105
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,920
validated it actually worked mitigating

1106
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,599
that particular ransomware

1107
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,440
and then sent that and we actually sent

1108
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,640
a cyber nine line out

1109
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,839
to texas to say hey texas this is an

1110
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,839
issue um you really need to deal with it

1111
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,520
we had a lot of exchanges between the

1112
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,440
texas ciso as well as their network

1113
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,960
boundary layer folks

1114
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,480
interesting thing here though is their

1115
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
network boundary folks are civilians

1116
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,839
they're not militaries no national guard

1117
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,680
so there was no relationship there it

1118
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,359
was just us reaching out on a law

1119
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,720
enforcement nature

1120
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,359
to them to say hey we have an issue they

1121
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,520
were able to put that yar rule in place

1122
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,200
they actually stopped immediately

1123
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
stopped further further

1124
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,640
infections from that ransomware because

1125
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
the way the vector the attack vector

1126
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,280
that was being used

1127
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,119
so this was a really cool means for us

1128
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,880
pushing information down to a state that

1129
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,079
didn't ask for help

1130
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,000
but we saw something we were able to

1131
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,680
identify it as a solution to their

1132
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,040
problem and then reach out to them

1133
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
directly

1134
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,480
washington state washington state was an

1135
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,440
interesting one a couple months ago um

1136
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,920
during

1137
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,640
one of their election cycles uh they

1138
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,000
believed that they were

1139
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,920
being attacked their election system was

1140
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,280
being attacked and they did actually

1141
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,680
have

1142
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,200
quite a few attacks against their

1143
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,680
election infrastructure

1144
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,320
none that i'm aware of actually were

1145
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,040
effective

1146
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
but the first one that came to light was

1147
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,160
one where

1148
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,320
they have access to our cyber 99 program

1149
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,000
they submitted a request for a cyber

1150
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,960
nine line

1151
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,320
let me step back for a sec because i

1152
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,599
want to say one thing the cyber nine

1153
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,960
line started because

1154
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
of my background in uh the military

1155
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,480
in the army uh for those of you who are

1156
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
military

1157
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,079
a medevac a nine-line medevac is

1158
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,200
something that i had

1159
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
had was unfortunate enough to be

1160
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,800
involved in many times

1161
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
and what that is is it's nine lines of

1162
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
information that allows

1163
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,359
an a individual at a

1164
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,200
operation center to understand that

1165
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
there's a medical issue

1166
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,440
here's exactly the the very succinct

1167
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,480
non-emotional

1168
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,800
facts of the situation so that they know

1169
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,960
what type of response to send out

1170
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,040
to deal with that medical emergency

1171
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,440
whether it's a helicopter or a truck

1172
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,480
whether it's a broken limb or a death

1173
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
so the details are all there the

1174
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,480
incident information is all there it's

1175
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
the quick triage information that's what

1176
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,000
a nine line is

1177
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,240
when when we look at cyber we needed the

1178
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,920
same thing and the cyber nine line

1179
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,359
program allowed us to get that

1180
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,520
information the fundamental information

1181
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,160
the non-emotional non-sensitive

1182
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,880
information

1183
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,200
from a state to identify what was going

1184
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,000
on there

1185
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,800
and then deal with it and we can still

1186
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
deal with it because we have the

1187
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
fundamentals of what we need a cyber

1188
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,119
command to affect that

1189
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,920
that change that fixed that solution

1190
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,040
washington state

1191
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,359
so if you look at that said we could use

1192
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,040
some help in malware analysis

1193
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,839
uh actually in uh not my analysis but in

1194
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,359
our exchange of information

1195
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,440
to some of the assets that we had access

1196
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
to our law enforcement relationships our

1197
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,920
counterintelligence relationships

1198
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
because obviously cyber command has a

1199
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,280
pretty strong working relationship with

1200
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,640
the nsa

1201
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,920
when they reached out they said we

1202
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,760
believe we're being attacked

1203
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
we did a lot of research on our end were

1204
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
able to push them back some clarifying

1205
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,359
indicators that then led them to

1206
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,079
ask their fbi counterparts who

1207
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,440
intervened

1208
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
sent a request over to amazon because

1209
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,520
the aws stuff was being it was being

1210
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,119
hosted in aws

1211
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,960
were able to identify who the owners of

1212
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,720
that were and then over the course of

1213
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,640
that process they realized that this

1214
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,520
company

1215
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,400
was actually set up to do testing of

1216
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,319
their network systems but nobody had

1217
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,079
informed the state that that source

1218
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,359
would come from

1219
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,839
that aws instant even though that

1220
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,680
organization was hired to test the

1221
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
election systems

1222
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
so what was really cool about that was

1223
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,640
we saw

1224
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,839
within 24 hours a circle of life where

1225
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,560
we even saw the request from the fbi

1226
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,920
over to amazon

1227
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,319
to to sort out the information and

1228
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,520
realize that it wasn't

1229
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
a true attack on the washington election

1230
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
systems it was actually a test to

1231
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,599
validate as part of their normalized

1232
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,240
processes

1233
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,160
storms refine us so this is my uh

1234
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,800
fundamental

1235
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,079
second point to um what i wanted to

1236
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,079
to bring to light is that over the

1237
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,440
course of

1238
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,599
of your engagements wherever you're at

1239
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,680
uh those storms are actually a good

1240
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,560
thing um

1241
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,200
yeah a nice picture but um really what i

1242
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
wanna i wanna play out here

1243
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,760
is um i spent some time in seattle where

1244
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,599
it rains all the time

1245
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,520
where the environment isn't um

1246
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,319
the nicest it usually has a bad wrap of

1247
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:04,960
being

1248
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,079
rainy cold damp and drizzly but

1249
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,640
the really cool secret to seattle is

1250
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,079
that if you wait a week

1251
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,880
the sun comes out it's blue skies and

1252
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,119
completely blue not a cloud

1253
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,599
absolutely stunning sun and then not on

1254
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,400
top of that

1255
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
you just look outside you see the

1256
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,319
olympic mountains the cascade mountains

1257
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,920
mount rainier to the south standing at

1258
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,520
14 000 feet

1259
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,240
it's huge and it's awesome i also spent

1260
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,000
some time in boulder colorado when i was

1261
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,720
younger

1262
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,119
i lived there for almost a year the

1263
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,960
storms there are completely different

1264
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
storms roll through they hit there

1265
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,960
around noon thunder lightning for about

1266
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,839
an hour

1267
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,760
and then the rains roll out across the

1268
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,839
plains and you actually watch

1269
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,040
those clouds move away to the east

1270
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
and it happens every day but you know

1271
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,640
it's going to happen and you know those

1272
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,920
storms are going to come

1273
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,599
i think the big takeaway here is that

1274
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,960
even though boulder

1275
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
colorado seattle washington are both

1276
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,960
different and unique in the way the

1277
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,240
storms are hitting

1278
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,720
it doesn't matter the sun still comes

1279
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,000
out at the end

1280
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the storms move away they wash away all

1281
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,440
the filth and it leaves everything clean

1282
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,119
not to not to say everything's going to

1283
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,960
be you know unicorns and rainbows when

1284
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,400
it comes to how we're dealing with cyber

1285
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,839
that's not what i'm trying to say

1286
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,280
you know really i think you get the

1287
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,480
point that we're going to have storms

1288
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,319
we have to face the the light of the day

1289
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,240
and we have to face them head-on

1290
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,720
you know we can't hide behind it we we

1291
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,440
just know

1292
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,520
that those storms will come we plan for

1293
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,480
the best we can

1294
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,280
we adapt as the storms roll through us

1295
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,400
and then we overcome them

1296
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,040
connecticut uh when we reflect on the

1297
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,720
cyber nine line program and what we did

1298
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,880
there was another unique one

1299
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,720
one of our teams here similar to texas

1300
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,800
was looking in some locations across the

1301
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,680
internet

1302
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,520
and found that the admin credentials

1303
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,599
for the state of connecticut department

1304
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,359
of health

1305
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,079
were compromised and was for their

1306
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,680
department of health their actual

1307
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,440
systems their one of their admins for

1308
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,240
their state

1309
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,680
state health department uh we called up

1310
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,200
and put a cybernine line in we called up

1311
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,880
connecticut they validated that they

1312
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
were actually current and valid

1313
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,000
um but thankfully it looks like that the

1314
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,119
even though the sale

1315
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,440
went through on the particular forums we

1316
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,960
were watching they had changed their

1317
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,319
password by then

1318
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,599
and they never saw any effect from that

1319
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,760
so being able to quickly identify

1320
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,240
potential threats against states

1321
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,000
really helped mitigate connecticut in

1322
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
this situation

1323
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,560
virus total so i work with an

1324
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
organization called cyber national

1325
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,440
mission force

1326
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,079
they are a component of u.s cyber

1327
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,200
command

1328
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,359
and over the last couple of years you've

1329
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,040
probably seen a virus total and

1330
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,160
reflections of this

1331
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,119
in media where our cyber national

1332
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,200
mission force has released signatures

1333
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,560
of foreign nation states this is part of

1334
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,839
a process we call hunt

1335
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,880
forward and hunt forward is where

1336
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
that organization will send a defensive

1337
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,599
team out to a nation-state

1338
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,560
that is being used by a malicious cyber

1339
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,119
actor

1340
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,319
either as a pivot or um you know some

1341
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,160
type of redirector

1342
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,079
or just absconded with infrastructure

1343
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
there that they're using to just host

1344
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:24,880
their malware

1345
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,839
could be anything where we go into that

1346
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,520
with the state's permission with the

1347
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,200
nation states permission

1348
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,599
and we help them clean that up we take

1349
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,839
that malware we bring it back to our

1350
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,119
place we rip it apart

1351
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,000
and then we release it so that the

1352
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,319
independent security firms that are out

1353
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,640
there can do their due diligence

1354
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,680
to figure out what this uh software is

1355
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,720
what it's doing

1356
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,040
why it's malicious and then attribute it

1357
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
to a foreign adversary

1358
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,960
and that's that's work that we were able

1359
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,720
to really

1360
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,040
i thought it was a very unique play on

1361
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,520
the way we normally that security

1362
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,599
researchers tend to do business where

1363
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,599
it's not just a security researcher

1364
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,599
coming across it on some forum this was

1365
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,800
actually the federal government

1366
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
identifying the same thing

1367
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,760
and giving it to the security

1368
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,520
researchers to do the work to put out

1369
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,560
the media

1370
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,000
um and point people um to a foreign

1371
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,920
nation state that's doing bad stuff

1372
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:29,839
um to our nation

1373
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,800
last big point uh is all things get

1374
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,880
difficult before they get easy

1375
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,720
and we talked about this in in a few

1376
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,880
different ways uh but i want to point

1377
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,800
out two uh

1378
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,400
um examples for this hawaii has a cyber

1379
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,839
disruption plan and their cyber

1380
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,960
disruption plan

1381
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,440
um you know has been exercised in the

1382
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
past but to their

1383
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,240
admission it's not the most ideal um

1384
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,920
i think every state can reflect on their

1385
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,520
disruption plan and go

1386
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,160
we'd like to exercise it more and to

1387
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,200
hawaii's credit

1388
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,760
they have a very proactive uh team

1389
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,800
that's actively working to integrate

1390
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,839
the military because of the ties to our

1391
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,960
pacific command

1392
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,520
as we call it the the nearness of them

1393
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,079
to north korea and china and russia

1394
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,640
um you know we think back to and we we

1395
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,079
have reflections of these

1396
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,720
uh pearl harbor but you hear the cyber

1397
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,599
pearl harbor

1398
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,960
they don't want to be that they don't

1399
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,800
want to have that same issue again

1400
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
and so hawaii is coming up with another

1401
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,640
it has another exercise coming up in

1402
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,440
november

1403
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,040
where they're going to be proactively

1404
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,520
exercising our cybernine line program

1405
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,960
but also

1406
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,839
refining their cyber disruption plan

1407
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,040
tweaking it even more

1408
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,680
integrating the agencies within that

1409
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,280
we're working directly with the state

1410
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,599
ciso and others to make that happen

1411
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,880
so it's a whole of state effort and a

1412
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
really good news story for

1413
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,000
uh for one state in particular

1414
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,119
rhode island is another one and uh

1415
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,119
rhode island was um

1416
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,760
was an interesting one because of their

1417
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,839
um

1418
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,960
and actually misspoke earlier

1419
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,880
i just want to be clear on this rhode

1420
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,000
island was the one

1421
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,680
that uh that had the department of

1422
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,760
health uh credentials being released we

1423
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,880
worked with them on that

1424
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,760
so um the connecticut situation as i was

1425
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,319
referring to

1426
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,000
before was actually uh one where

1427
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,240
ransomware owned their servers and in

1428
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,559
this case that ransomware affected

1429
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,480
almost 300 of those servers we talked

1430
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,000
about the fact that it delayed school

1431
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
for a day

1432
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,000
and uh we were able to assist them

1433
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,359
because they called in

1434
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
their uh national guard their national

1435
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,640
guard reached out to us because they

1436
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,720
were part of the cyber nine line program

1437
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,200
and they said can you help us out they

1438
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,319
were able to provide us foreign

1439
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,480
indicators as well as malware

1440
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,119
and in that situation it was about 20

1441
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,000
hours later

1442
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
we had two male reports that had ripped

1443
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,680
apart their malware and we're pointing

1444
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,480
them

1445
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,640
towards other indicators that they could

1446
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,319
use to defend themselves

1447
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,000
on top of that those malware reports

1448
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,760
like any good report will actually point

1449
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,000
you to where those files live on disk

1450
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,160
so now you can see in memory and on disk

1451
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,000
where you need to go hunt out and root

1452
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,160
out that adversary plus you can scan

1453
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,400
your systems for additional

1454
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,680
indicators that you might have

1455
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,040
so like any good talk what i want to do

1456
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,400
is leave you with three fundamental

1457
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,359
points

1458
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,960
these will be quick and this is the last

1459
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,640
little bit of my

1460
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,839
my my keynote

1461
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,839
fundamentally fundamentally failure is

1462
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,680
not falling down

1463
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,000
you are going to fall down you are going

1464
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,680
to have great a's

1465
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,200
it's the refusing to get up part

1466
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,200
that will keep you from succeeding

1467
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,839
i think most organizations are very

1468
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,760
um flexible

1469
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,880
when it comes to failure as long as the

1470
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,040
person that's failing

1471
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,800
has the gumption and the motivation to

1472
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
get back up on their feet

1473
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,680
and keep going learn from their mistakes

1474
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,559
attempt not to do them again although

1475
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,359
being human that's hard to do sometimes

1476
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,319
and just keep going

1477
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,200
success doesn't always go to the

1478
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,960
strongest

1479
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,480
it doesn't go to the smartest it doesn't

1480
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,319
always go to the fastest

1481
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,160
uh rather success comes from hard work

1482
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,319
persistence and an ability to work with

1483
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,720
others

1484
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,440
fundamentally clear and concise

1485
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,359
communications matter

1486
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,720
and it underpins your ability to nurture

1487
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,599
partnerships and those partnerships i

1488
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,200
would challenge you

1489
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,079
could be outside of your locality of

1490
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,280
your state

1491
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,680
could be with the federal government

1492
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,200
whereas the federal government gets

1493
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,960
scoffed at a lot of times with the

1494
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,920
we're here to help i would say that over

1495
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,079
the last few years

1496
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,280
we've seen a drastic and highly

1497
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,319
reflective

1498
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,119
change of the federal government and

1499
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:13,839
particularly

1500
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,520
cyber command to engage

1501
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,240
the state and localities help them

1502
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,960
rebuild

1503
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,040
when needed help enable their

1504
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,319
self-defense

1505
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,559
not trying to you know be overbearing or

1506
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,760
getting their wheaties

1507
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,760
but really trying to help them succeed

1508
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,400
and lastly agile creative thinking

1509
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,599
will enable you to adapt

1510
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,200
to your environment as it inevitably

1511
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,040
changes

1512
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,160
this goes and reflects back to you will

1513
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,040
be succumbed by events but as long as

1514
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,480
you persist

1515
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,280
as long as you get back up on your feet

1516
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,240
again

1517
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,118
you will overcome

1518
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,680
i'm going to close out with this slide

1519
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,359
i'm gonna leave it up um because what i

1520
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,280
wanted to do was i talked about the

1521
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,800
cyber nine line program

1522
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,880
um i'm really not trying to make this an

1523
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,240
advertisement for it

1524
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,920
but if you had any talking points or if

1525
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,680
you want to reach out to me on that

1526
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,079
um the cybernine line at cybercom dot

1527
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,000
mil is the best way to do so

1528
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,480
um that really sets this slide really

1529
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,520
summarizes

1530
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,680
uh what i talked about in some of those

1531
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,800
efforts

1532
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,240
i hope it leaves you with a better

1533
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,920
feeling for what the federal

1534
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,599
government's trying to do

1535
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,200
we're using this program not just for

1536
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,680
elections this is an election this is

1537
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,280
not an election specific

1538
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,200
solution this is a holy government

1539
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,839
solution that has long lasting efforts

1540
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,599
it's the way that cyber command can

1541
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,960
receive information from

1542
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,559
companies states locals you name it

1543
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,119
so with that i want to see what

1544
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,559
questions you have and have a little

1545
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,760
dialogue back and forth

1546
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,839
so just double checking sam you can

1547
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,720
hear me right i can thank you all right

1548
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,359
so

1549
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,440
um we're we're cutting a little close on

1550
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,280
time unfortunately

1551
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,640
due to the uh the demons of the

1552
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,240
interwebs giving us a little trouble

1553
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,319
this morning i think we can go for

1554
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,359
for one question on here quick and then

1555
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,000
are you going to be available in discord

1556
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,640
for a few

1557
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,680
to follow up on the others and i'll i'll

1558
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,960
help get the questions that weren't

1559
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,240
queued to you

1560
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,280
via discord um

1561
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,720
so one of the things that

1562
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,000
came up that hopefully will be

1563
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,160
a good one to to close out on because it

1564
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,599
was a major theme

1565
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,079
so someone asked what part do ransomware

1566
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:44,640
and breach

1567
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,480
insurance companies play in either

1568
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,800
encouraging or deterring malicious cyber

1569
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,760
actors

1570
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,800
and the context around that was they've

1571
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,839
heard that some

1572
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,599
for some organizations it's cheaper to

1573
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
pay the deductibles

1574
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,640
than it is to actually secure their

1575
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,480
network

1576
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,079
yeah i think like any good malicious

1577
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,000
cyber actor and i'm going to use that

1578
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,359
term broadly to mean

1579
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,720
criminal or nation state the intent is

1580
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,240
the same to suck money from an

1581
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,520
organization whether it's a state or

1582
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,240
local

1583
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,520
um and what we've seen is a trend

1584
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,480
towards the request for payments they're

1585
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,240
not asking for millions they're asking

1586
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
for thousands hundreds of thousands

1587
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,040
um which is significantly less and

1588
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,960
sometimes less painful for a state or

1589
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,319
locality

1590
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,440
um we don't we don't get into the

1591
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,400
knowledge

1592
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,720
uh base for what's happening with what a

1593
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,839
state chooses to do and how they're

1594
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,240
responding

1595
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,000
so i don't know if i can really answer

1596
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,040
the question to the extent that the um

1597
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,359
the requester was you know the question

1598
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,880
was asked

1599
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,319
we have seen that actors are

1600
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,040
adjusting to the fact that there is

1601
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,400
cyber insurance

1602
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,160
and that companies would rather pay the

1603
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,440
insurance than deal with

1604
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,240
um other things but we've also seen a

1605
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,400
lot of organizations and states for that

1606
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,119
matter

1607
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,280
not paying even though they have

1608
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,319
insurance

1609
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,280
not paying the ransom because they could

1610
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,240
see it as an

1611
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,520
you know what we typically see in

1612
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,960
ransomware is either it's going to come

1613
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,160
in a different form

1614
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,799
or the the malicious cyber actor is

1615
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,559
going to change their ttp

1616
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,400
and instead of locking down their

1617
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,839
systems they don't lock down their

1618
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:22,720
systems but they

1619
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,359
threaten to and then they validate their

1620
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,160
proof

1621
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,280
um so i think i think if the

1622
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,920
issue hasn't happened i've seen the

1623
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,559
actor

1624
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,000
morph to a position where because the

1625
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,760
cyber insurance won't pay out because

1626
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,839
the network hasn't been locked down

1627
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,440
there's no actual

1628
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,240
result of the ransomware yet it's just

1629
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,720
the threat and proof from the actor

1630
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,040
that actors are manipulating the way

1631
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,720
they i say manipulate they're actually

1632
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,720
changing their tactics to adjust

1633
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,799
to those you know those rules and

1634
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,880
regulations within the payouts

1635
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,319
yes they want their money but

1636
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,760
when it comes to actually the the

1637
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,680
payouts themselves i don't think i have

1638
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,280
a better answer

1639
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,559
than that unfortunately okay well

1640
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,440
a huge thank you for the presentation

1641
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,480
your time today

1642
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,760
uh the i was listening the whole time on

1643
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,359
the background to know when to jump back

1644
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:17,599
in

1645
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,640
it was great material and uh and thank

1646
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,280
you for

1647
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,200
for the overview and the insight i i

1648
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,960
think it resonates with

1649
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,160
with a lot of the community uh here

1650
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,680
in the b-side charlotte group um

1651
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,720
so with that um

1652
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,079
uh sam will be joining us on discord for

1653
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,040
a little while to

1654
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,640
to answer any of the other follow-up

1655
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,839
questions i know there's a few

1656
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,000
outstanding so we'll get to those and

1657
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,640
just a

1658
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,359
couple logistical items as we're moving

1659
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,960
into the ten o'clock time

1660
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,520
frame uh the first one is the ctf so

1661
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,079
anybody who's participating in the ctf

1662
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,240
they are going to be doing an overview

1663
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,000
of the ctf platform and

1664
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,640
how to use that platform in the ctf

1665
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,559
channel so go over there take a look at

1666
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,200
that

1667
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,040
uh we've got some folks if you're having

1668
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,319
trouble with that that may be able to

1669
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,520
help you out

1670
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,559
and then the final thing is

1671
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,000
there'll need to be a couple of minutes

1672
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,680
transition between

1673
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,400
