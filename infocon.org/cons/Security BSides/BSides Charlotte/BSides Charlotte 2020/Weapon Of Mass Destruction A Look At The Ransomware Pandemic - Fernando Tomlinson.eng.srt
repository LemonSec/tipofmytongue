00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,560
hello everyone

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,360
and welcome to b-side charlotte this is

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,000
my talk

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,840
weapon of mass destruction a look at

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,599
ransomware academic

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,920
i'm fernando tomlinson all right so a

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,119
little bit about myself

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,800
i've been with the department of defense

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
for about 19 years

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,640
i'm a cyber security adjunct professor

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
also a technology consultant with

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,960
reliable cyber solutions and i'm a

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,800
powershell enthusiast

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
there's a number of sites in which i

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
have a presence on so if you're looking

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,440
to connect

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,480
you can find me there

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
all right here's our agenda uh today

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,920
and then as we begin this and really get

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,640
started

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,399
uh i would be remiss if i didn't talk

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,320
about the different malware types

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
so as we talk about viruses right

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
nothing more than a piece of code that's

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,440
capable of copying itself

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,079
or worms you know items that replicate

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,719
itself

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
in order to spread across other machines

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,399
you know we have things like

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,720
like key loggers right that essentially

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,840
track and record

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
a person's keystroke and then we kind of

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
get to the point where

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
um we have ransomware and it itself

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
is designed to deny access to a system

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
or data until a ransom is paid

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
now that's a very quick and upfront uh

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
definition of it but really let's look

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
at what other people in our field

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
seem to say about it and as we look at

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,960
these people all reputable

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
entities in our field they all pretty

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,640
much stay the same

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
although their words are slightly

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
different the summary of it all is that

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,680
it is all

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
the same and they all have had their

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
fair share dealing with ransomware

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,360
um as a service in which they um provide

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
the people to remediate

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
so targets who are the targets of this

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
ransomware

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
well typically it's home users and

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,880
businesses

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,479
why is it home users well because they

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
typically don't have any backups

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,719
right they have little to no cyber

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
security education

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
um they typically don't keep their

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,520
software up to date

61
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,239
they don't have the need or fail to

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,280
invest in

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
um cyber security solutions that would

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,000
prevent such things from happening

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
and then businesses right that's where

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
all the money is

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
so if i'm an attacker that's where i'm

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
going to get the biggest payoff so it

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
would make sense that businesses would

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,680
be here

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
smaller businesses are often unprepared

72
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,560
to deal with advanced cyber attacks

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
right uh systems and companies are often

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
complex and prone to vulnerabilities

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
that can be exploited

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
and really it becomes businesses having

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
a lot more

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640
um to lose as one would say and this is

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
why people tend to target them

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
so why is this ransomware thing even a

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
thing well authors instill fear and

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
panic into their victims

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
this causes people to do things they

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,519
typically wouldn't do

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
well you're holding my data for ransom

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,200
and i can no longer access it

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,239
i want this feeling to cease so i'm

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,200
willing to

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,519
uh pay a ransom or i'm willing to do

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,840
whatever it is that you want me to do

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
uh intimidating messages could also um

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,599
instill fearing people hey your computer

93
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,239
is

94
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,959
has been visiting illegal content and to

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,640
unlock it you must pay a hundred dollar

96
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,200
fine

97
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,879
all right wrong right and different

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,879
people don't want to find themselves in

99
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
such a position where they're faced with

100
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,000
things like that

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,159
and it's also lucrative when we look at

102
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
stuff like cyber extortion

103
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,440
um that's mainly why ransomware is a

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
thing and the impact

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
of it all well there's temporary

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
permanent loss of sensitive proprietary

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,319
information

108
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,720
disruption to regular operations nobody

109
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,159
wants that especially if i'm an

110
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,519
organization where

111
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,239
our main revenue is based on a service

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
or good that we provide

113
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
any disruption to that could have uh

114
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
fatal consequences to the organization

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,319
could also harm the organization's uh

116
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,959
reputation nobody wants to lose stock

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
or investments or anything having to

118
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,319
deal with the organization

119
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
so again uh the impacts are rather huge

120
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,480
and large in this aspect

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,519
the common vectors well typically spear

122
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
fishing

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
vulnerability exploitation what is

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
publicly facing that can be exploited to

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
gain a foothold in the organization

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
to then privilege escalate ourselves

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,639
later on

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
maybe some poorly secured services that

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,320
you know

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
have uh some remote execution or some

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,160
other

132
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
um bounce check that isn't fully done

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
and then there's a number of other

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
infections

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
but when we look at the breakdown of the

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,800
top three

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
fission software vulnerability rdp

138
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120
compromise we see rdp

139
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,240
overwhelmingly leads the front here

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,080
anything that's really publicly facing

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
and accessible that people can

142
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
just continuously try to tag at until

143
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,520
they gain

144
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
access becomes a vector

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
and really when we look at ransomware

146
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,720
there's two types

147
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
we have lockers right they essentially

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
deny access to a specific machine

149
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
they're more easily removed because

150
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,479
they're essentially putting

151
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,720
a window in front of the rest of our

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
data uh

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
preventing us from accessing accessing

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,800
it

155
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,199
we have cryptos those are the things

156
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
that are actually encrypting

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
um the files and stuff on our machine it

158
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,039
requires some reversing

159
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
of the process to be able to get it back

160
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
now where crypto really

161
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
wins out is with people who don't

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,639
utilize backups in an offline manner

163
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
right because now people find themselves

164
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
in such a place

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,199
where they are more prone to pay the fee

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,800
because they have no other way to get

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,720
that data back

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
now with all that being said we'll take

169
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,160
a trip back down

170
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,560
uh memory lane right because we all

171
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,440
recognize ransomware is a thing

172
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
but let's take a little history lesson

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
to to really understand

174
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
where it came from well back in 1989

175
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
dr joseph popp uh had the

176
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,039
aids ransomware and essentially

177
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,560
he had 20 000 copies of distributed on a

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,639
floppy disk right labeled aids

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,440
information

180
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,479
introductory diskettes it had surveys on

181
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:24,960
it

182
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,199
um but it also uh replaced the

183
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,520
autoexec.bat

184
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,240
right and essentially the autoexec.bat

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
and earlier windows machines

186
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
um contained instructions of what to

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
execute when an operating system

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
was booting up and it would lay dormant

189
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
until the 90th reboot at such time

190
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
it would begin to hide direct the reason

191
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
renamed

192
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,479
now the ransom here was labeled a

193
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
licensing fee

194
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,880
and it was in the sum of roughly 189 or

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,400
378 dollars

196
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
now we didn't have a lot of technology

197
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
then like we do today

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,240
so the uh person requested that they

199
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,800
send

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,599
a cashier's check or money order to a po

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,160
box

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,360
in panama now this didn't last long and

203
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
this guy was

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
actually booked in charge in the united

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
kingdom it was uh extradited to the

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
united states

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
now interesting enough he tried to claim

208
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
that the money would be donated to

209
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
the aids research and really it wasn't

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
and that wasn't his plan

211
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,280
so as we look at that we had a number of

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,319
other things happen

213
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,919
and then we find ourselves in roughly

214
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,319
2008 and this is when

215
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
bitcoin started to become a thing

216
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,759
anonymous

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,880
secure instant not regulated super

218
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
perfect for extortion

219
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
now we say all this because this starts

220
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
to lead into

221
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
um the payment of choice after that

222
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,680
and really in present day

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
so we have uh uh this one which we seen

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
in roughly 2012 it exploits the

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
vulnerability in the browser

226
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,840
largely targeted folks who were looking

227
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
at adult sites

228
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
and it redirected them to like a beef

229
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
server of sorts

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
the payment was roughly three hundred

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,160
dollars they wanted it in the prepaid

232
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,039
card

233
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
uh the tactics right trying to

234
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,479
intimidate people

235
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,199
so they would be presented with a

236
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,720
screenshot kind of like what we see on

237
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
the right here

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,319
fbi crime division right just trying to

239
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,120
insinuate

240
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
fear in people now after um

241
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
it was done with everything it did it

242
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,719
would try to

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,360
harvest passwords right this was post

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,919
payment

245
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
so it was bad enough that it will lock

246
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,279
you out of your system

247
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
prevent you from accessing this stuff

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
and that you paid a fee

249
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
but following that it would then try to

250
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,240
steal

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
um passwords now this one was easily

252
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,480
removable because

253
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
we could boot it to safe mode and remove

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,600
the registry key

255
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
and be good to go so essentially um it

256
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
was just presenting the window

257
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,959
which prevented us from accessing our

258
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,640
actual machine of sorts

259
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,279
now if that screen shot isn't enough for

260
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,680
you

261
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
it also had another one where it tried

262
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
to act as if it was part of the national

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
security agency

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,760
again in everything it could to instill

265
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,640
fear in the people whose system it was

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,839
being run

267
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,680
on then we had cryptolocker right this

268
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
was first seen somewhere around 2013.

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
it typically used email as a vector

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
it began to do encrypting of files this

271
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,240
was kind of the first time we started

272
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
seeing this tactic

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
truly being done it was about 70 types

274
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,279
that it looked to do

275
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,360
um and it used asymmetric encryption so

276
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
we had a private key we had a public key

277
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
of sorts now it also utilized dga

278
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,519
uh domain generated algorithm where it

279
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,640
had a subset

280
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,600
of domains that weren't registered but

281
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,519
then at certain times those domains

282
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,880
would get registered

283
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
and then as it would go down this list

284
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
of domains to try to contact it would

285
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
get to one that's finally registered

286
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
and then it would try to communicate

287
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
with that system as a c2

288
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
at the time it uh infected over 250

289
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
000 machines and this was really a big

290
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
deal when we think about the time in

291
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
which this was happening

292
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
now it also propagated over the game

293
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
over zeus botnet but

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,959
in 2014 this was taken down and the keys

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,120
were recovered from the c2 server

296
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
um and given to those who were still

297
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
following who fell victim

298
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,560
to it then we had

299
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,959
torrent walker somewhere around 2014 and

300
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,160
this was mainly seen

301
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
overseas australia new zealand um

302
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,399
area primarily spread through email it

303
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,519
also encrypted

304
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
but what it looked to do was harbor

305
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
harvest rather

306
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
email addresses on the system as a

307
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
method to then

308
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
turn around and send emails to other

309
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
people within your contact list

310
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,399
to be able to propagate itself it also

311
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,440
sought to delete

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
volume shadow copies so that's something

313
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
inherent to windows where they would

314
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,760
take essentially snapshots of the volume

315
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
and fouls of sorts the ransom was

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
somewhere around 500

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,880
dollars in bitcoin and then guess what

318
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,399
every receiver

319
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
differs for each victim so there was

320
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
multiple different variations

321
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
of this

322
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
we had tesla somewhere around 2015

323
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
and what was interesting about this

324
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,959
is this is the first one that actually

325
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,320
also targeted

326
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,519
gaming of systems or data right

327
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
it also utilized email and vulnerable

328
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,440
servers as vectors

329
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
this one was somewhere around 185 file

330
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
extensions that it would try to seek to

331
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
encrypt

332
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
um the gaming data that it would look

333
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,480
for is about

334
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,839
40 extensions um and then the ransom was

335
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,320
somewhere around 550 dollars in bitcoin

336
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,720
so

337
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,560
if you found yourself as one of these

338
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
die hard gamers using pc

339
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,240
uh as a gaming platform uh tesla crypt

340
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
would also look to target you

341
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
to go after that data imagine a person

342
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
who's

343
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
um near the end of world of warcraft

344
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,240
and now their system gets encrypted that

345
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,800
becomes

346
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,760
data that is so valuable maybe to the

347
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
the person who owns it

348
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
that they may pay this ransom because

349
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
they want it back

350
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,639
so this this ransomware look to take

351
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,200
advantage

352
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
of that in 2016 though this was

353
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,240
decommissioned

354
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
and it was so abrupt right the

355
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
developers just stopped propagating it

356
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
they switched to other efforts

357
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,200
the decryption key was uh released um

358
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
so it became something readily

359
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,320
accessible to

360
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,839
those who fell victim to it

361
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,959
2016 we see in lockheed lockey really

362
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,920
focused on

363
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
microsoft office products now this was

364
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,000
interesting because when we look at the

365
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,279
screenshot there

366
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,839
we clearly see that macros have been

367
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,720
disabled

368
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
right and we see the option there that

369
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,160
we can check to re-enable them

370
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720
but within the document in red we see

371
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
enable macro if the data encoded is

372
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
incorrect

373
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
well the authors of this purposely typed

374
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,079
that

375
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,440
in so no matter what it would look

376
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
jar ruled up which then would have

377
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
people

378
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,680
enable macros thinking that they were

379
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
actually fixing the problem

380
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,760
and instead what they were doing were

381
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
infecting themselves

382
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
now this document distributed via botnet

383
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,000
had over five million act devices

384
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,959
right what's interesting is that this is

385
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
one piece of ransomware like

386
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,320
many others that doesn't affect

387
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
certain language um packs right so

388
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
trying to stay away from geographic

389
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
areas and

390
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,920
or certain dialects in languages that

391
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,720
people

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
speak now again this was interesting

393
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,839
because the

394
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
the macros is already disabled the

395
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
machine is trying to get you to disable

396
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
i'm sorry enable it

397
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
for the sake of infecting your machine

398
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
and largely how this whole scheme

399
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,120
uh of maneuver if you will worked is the

400
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
attacker would send an email

401
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
the user would uh open the email any

402
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,920
attachment

403
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
the user would enable the macro right

404
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
the system would already be protecting

405
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,760
you because it would have macros

406
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,639
disabled

407
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,279
um likely and then you would be

408
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
infecting yourself

409
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,519
by enabling macros a binary is

410
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,720
downloaded and executed

411
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
your backups are deleted and files are

412
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,320
encrypted right

413
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,360
and then we see the the ransom note

414
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,199
uh that's presented to you when this

415
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,599
happens

416
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,399
pena seen in 2016 um

417
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
we wrote over the master boot record

418
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
and then um blue screened you forcing

419
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,519
you to restart

420
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,399
a fake check this would then run and at

421
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
that time it would seek to encrypt the

422
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
master file table

423
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,240
this would black access to the entire

424
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,959
machine

425
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,120
not just your files so this was kind of

426
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,399
interesting because

427
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
you had the same effect of encrypting

428
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,680
specific

429
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
files as you would with just denying

430
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
access to the whole drive

431
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
this was given a ransom of roughly 300

432
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,600
or so and what's interesting when we

433
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,279
look at the uh

434
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,079
the chart there is there is

435
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,360
overwhelmingly

436
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,560
one country that was infected more than

437
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
some of the other ones so we might

438
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,199
seek to think that um this was a

439
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,079
targeted

440
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,120
uh type of attack or or or maybe not

441
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,399
so also from that we had wannacry so

442
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,720
this was shortly after 2017

443
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,199
affected over 300 000 machines in

444
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,720
roughly 150 countries

445
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,360
and it is propagated via smb exploit of

446
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,440
17010 uh to be exact right

447
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
caused over a billion dollars in damages

448
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
primarily focused with windows 7

449
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
and we see the ransom now what's

450
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,199
interesting is you had like an

451
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,320
introductory

452
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
rate when it came to the ransom because

453
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,480
uh days after that that

454
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
fee would go up right it would almost

455
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,680
double uh it also

456
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
threatened to delete your data if your

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,079
payment wasn't received within a week

458
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
and what was really significant about

459
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
this and really how it

460
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
uh died off somewhat quickly was a

461
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,279
reverse engineer

462
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,399
was able to find the kill switch domain

463
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,720
in the code and he went out there and

464
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
and registered that domain right it was

465
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
the biggest outbreak in history but it

466
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
could have been a lot worse

467
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
if it wasn't for that and this breakdown

468
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,480
is as such right

469
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,480
it arrives via exploit against 17010

470
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
the file delivered via exploit it runs

471
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
as a service

472
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,399
drops the malware and then it encrypts

473
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,399
the local and shared files somewhere

474
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
around 176

475
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,959
file extensions you'll know kind of

476
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,480
clearly what you've been hit with

477
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
because the extension will be uh wn

478
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,160
cry right for one o'clock

479
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,640
then we have maze right first scene in

480
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,839
2019

481
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
delivery through spammy mill exploit

482
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,880
kits and then really here fair recently

483
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,039
um it was delivered through post

484
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,280
compromise right so post exploitation if

485
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,079
you will

486
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,880
they also have the capability to encrypt

487
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
via a virtual machine

488
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,839
so instead of this payload running

489
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,559
directly

490
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,600
on a system it would deploy a virtual

491
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,320
machine

492
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,600
somewhere to the tune of like 1.5 1.9

493
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,960
gigs and virtual box and then it would

494
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
have access to the host machine and then

495
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
encrypt

496
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,840
um like that as a method of of

497
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
bypassing measures and going undetected

498
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
now it nearly targeted every industry

499
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,280
of source and we can kind of see that

500
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,440
with the chart off to to the right

501
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,679
uh or not necessarily the chart off to

502
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,840
the right that's going to speak more to

503
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,039
uh the countries that

504
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
are were affected by this ransomware

505
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
but more interesting than not the actors

506
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
maintain a public-facing website

507
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,919
as a method to further embarrass if you

508
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,559
will

509
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,679
of companies so they will post

510
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
stolen data from victims that refuse to

511
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
pay

512
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
so you're either going to pay and we're

513
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
going to give you the decryption key

514
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
and you're going to get your data back

515
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
possibly or you're not going to pay

516
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,000
and we're going to post your data online

517
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
that is root

518
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
list and we still see maze being used

519
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
today

520
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
now i'll stop here for a minute all

521
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,799
right and

522
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,480
we'll address the definition of pandemic

523
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
all right because to this point we've

524
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
talked a little bit about

525
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,039
uh the significance of ransomware

526
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,000
we've talked about history of it now

527
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,400
there

528
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
are hundreds maybe thousands of variants

529
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
of ransomware we only talked about

530
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,799
uh eight or so of them but really with

531
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,080
this talk being

532
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,400
um talking about ransomware in a

533
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,360
pandemic

534
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
well what are we talking about here

535
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,200
looking at the definition pandemic

536
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,160
adjective

537
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,080
prevalent throughout an entire country

538
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
continent or the whole world

539
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
so when we look at what ransomware is

540
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,280
hitting it isn't specific to a state

541
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,919
in the united states it isn't specific

542
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,640
to the

543
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
united states as a whole it is something

544
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
that the entire world

545
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
is dealing with and it's only gonna

546
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,880
progressively

547
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,400
get worse as it has really over the last

548
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
five years so some numbers from the fbi

549
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,679
2015 8 000 complaints

550
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,440
reported loss of 275 million

551
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,640
2017 301

552
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,880
000 complaints 1.4 billion

553
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,320
just last year 467

554
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,240
thousand 3.5 billion

555
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,760
it's just gonna keep getting worse

556
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,200
now here's some statistics from 2019

557
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
50 of surveyed 582

558
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
cyber professionals don't believe their

559
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,240
organizations are prepared

560
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,120
to even deal with the ransomware attack

561
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,159
that's scary

562
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,559
that's also interesting average cost of

563
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,480
rental worry tackled businesses

564
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
was a hundred and thirty three thousand

565
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,320
fishing emails

566
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760
as we've articulated is invector initial

567
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,799
vector increased by 109 from 2017.

568
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,919
now of all the malware attacks rental

569
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,159
wear is behind

570
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,400
56 of them

571
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
99 of ransoms were paid in bitcoin we've

572
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,840
already

573
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,960
articulated why that is the case now

574
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
if this is from 2019 this year

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,039
is only gonna get worse it has been

576
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,679
worse

577
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,480
the pandemic on coronavirus and

578
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
everything else happening

579
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,280
hasn't had people just stop trying to do

580
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,559
ransomware attacks

581
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
it's actually increased right so here's

582
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
some more staggering

583
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,880
statistics the average incident lasts

584
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
9.6 days

585
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,480
the decrypter supplied 96 of the time

586
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
after payment let's digest that for a

587
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
minute

588
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
so somebody could get hit with

589
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
ransomware they could pay the ransom

590
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
and 96 of the time they would even get

591
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
the decrypter

592
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,840
wow imagine that that has successfully

593
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
recovered 93

594
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,559
of the time with the decrypt even worse

595
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
so i don't have a 100 chance of getting

596
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,640
the decrypter after payment

597
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
but even if i get it there's a 93

598
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,440
chance that it will actually work now

599
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,799
those are high numbers

600
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,200
but what if you're in that four percent

601
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
or in that seven percent

602
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,840
that's gotta hurt now a new organization

603
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,720
fell victim

604
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,919
every 14 seconds in 2019

605
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
it was projected that by 2021

606
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,360
11 seconds of sorts

607
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,200
let's look at some of the united states

608
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,720
industries that are affected

609
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,280
all right we got roughly 966

610
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,400
organizations that

611
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,240
we'll use here of those 11.7 were state

612
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
and municipal

613
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
governments and agencies 79 were health

614
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
care providers right

615
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
which would kind of make sense you hit

616
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,960
them the hardest because they may have

617
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
the biggest

618
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
to or the largest amount to lose now

619
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
some of the outcomes

620
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
emergency patients had to be redirected

621
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,840
to other hospitals

622
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
wow medical records were inaccessible

623
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,159
and in some cases permanently lost

624
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,640
911 services were interrupted

625
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,280
surveillance systems went offline

626
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,679
jail doors could not be remotely open

627
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,360
schools could not access

628
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,080
data about students medication or

629
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,440
allergies

630
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,240
i would tell you you already know this

631
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,679
ransomware authors

632
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,520
are ruthless they only see money

633
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
so here's some state governments that

634
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
were affected city of atlanta

635
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,679
march 2018 the ransom two thousand

636
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,240
dollars

637
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,320
they didn't pay they did not want to set

638
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
this the president's that

639
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,120
that they would conceive to such

640
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,000
behavior

641
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,679
instead the recovery uh cost them

642
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,360
roughly or over 17 million dollars

643
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,320
right jackson county georgia ransom 400

they paid it had an effect on law

648
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,000
not pay

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,280
the recovery cost 18 million dollars

650
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,679
right

651
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,480
they added an insurance plan um to cover

652
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
uh 20 million dollars

653

654
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
they paid it the attack shut down city

656
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,760
they ended up investing 900 000 into new

657
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,039
hardware to rebuild

658

the i.t infrastructures although they

659
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,559
paid it they still had

660
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,400
other issues and now they call

661
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,320
themselves posturing themselves

662
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,000
um for the next time lake city florida

663
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,760
5.3 million they did not pay it they

668
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
actually attempted to

669
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,679
negotiate here um but that didn't work

670
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,320
out

671
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,400
it was 158 workstations that were

672
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
affected that turned into roughly four

673
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,960
percent

674
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,679
of the city's uh computers if you will

675
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
now when we look at private sector

health care education

677
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
um we have stuff like the wood ranch

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720

server was encrypted

682
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,919
organization ended up going out of

683
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,880
business

684
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
campbell health campbell county health

685
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,039
unknown ransom

686
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,480
don't even know if they paid it

687
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
surgeries were canceled

688
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
er patients were transferred they were

689
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,760
forced to stop

690
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,720
accepting new impatient ad admissions

691
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,080
right the heritage group

692
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,720
ransom amount on no after 60 years of

693
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,200
business

694
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
they ended up having to close their

695
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,960
doors 300 employees left without a job

696
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,760
just before christmas let's look at the

697
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,640
school system

698
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,200
louisiana public schools several public

699
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,919
schools hit

700
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,799
affected 10 percent of the 5 000 servers

701
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,279
and over

702
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,559
1500 computers we got the rockville

703
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,840
school district ransom 176

704
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
000 they negotiated to 88 000.

705
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,000
the insurance cost about 10 000 in

706
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,960
deductible

707
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,840
right but again these things that are

708
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,320
being

709
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,000
hit our key infrastructure key items

710
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,320
that um take a toll on our daily lives

711
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,799
you know our government the healthcare

712
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,000
schools

713
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,279
again ransomware authors are ruthless

714
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,360
it's just gonna keep getting worse now

715
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
there's a group of people who are

716
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
looking at this and they're like

717
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,360
man this is horrible i want to help i

718
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
want to do something about it

719
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
awesome there's also another group of

720
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,799
people that's like man

721
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,360
that's awesome i wish i had the skills

722
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,240
and ability

723
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,760
to really do this and

724
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,559
it's kind of sad but if you're the

725
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,279
latter

726
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,440
um group of folks there's something for

727
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
you there's ransomware for the less

728
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,720
skilled so there's open source

729
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,520
ransomware

730
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,960
and then there's ransomware as a service

731
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
right so when we look at stuff like

732
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,000
stampedeo

733
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,840
lifetime access cost you

734
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,360
philadelphia 380 for unlimited license

735
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,679
and they even have a youtube

736
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,440
video right we have stuff like satan

737
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,320
you can customize your ransomware pick

738
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,360
your amount

739
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,640
add your bitcoin address what have you

740
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,960
the sky's the limit now the authors of

741
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
this are going to keep 30

742
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
and then here's a close-up of our

743
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
configurations of what we can do

744
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,960
so as somebody who's not skilled in this

745
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,320
i can keep 70

746
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,600
of my profits and i'm paying 30 to the

747
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,799
makers of this

748
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,080
service that i'm going to be utilizing

749
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,399
now some may feel hey you know what

750
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,399
ransomware is dangerous not really a

751
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,480
thing i'm concerned about because

752
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,840
um i don't use windows so i'm safe

753
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,600
well that's false right and what we see

754
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,120
here is that there's a ransomware for

755
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,960
nearly every barrier all right so we see

756
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
some linux mac os

757
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
ios we see android so mac os

758
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,039
patcher somewhere around 2017 disguised

759
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,000
itself as a

760
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,440
patch for applications like um microsoft

761
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,000
office

762
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
adobe pro things that you probably

763
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
wouldn't get off a torrent site

764
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
and want to get for free so this patch

765
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,520
would essentially be

766
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
um patching the software so you could

767
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,640
have uh

768
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,760
access as if you paid for it but instead

769
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,159
it would be uh holding your system for

770
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,039
ransom ransom was roughly 300

771
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,760
we have key ranger right it essentially

772
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,799
utilized

773
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,840
the transmission application and this is

774
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,679
nothing more than like a bittorrent for

775
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,720
mac os

776
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
so they had compromised it and on the

777
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,279
version of transmission

778
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,159
on the site the official site with the

779
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,200
developer signed

780
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,840
certificate when you download it and

781
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,960
installed it

782
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
it would um hold your system for ransom

783
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,640
of sorts

784
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,919
so again taking over a legitimate binary

785
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:38,880
from a legitimate

786
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,679
site with a developer certificate

787
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,640
download

788
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,799
install your system wouldn't think

789
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,240
anything about it because

790
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
it has a legitimate certificate from a

791
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,080
trusted entity

792
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,799
um and that's how it was getting around

793
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,120
uh

794
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
things so if

795
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,960
you're now terrified because of

796
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,559
ransomware as a whole

797
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,039
understanding that there's different uh

798
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,159
operating systems

799
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,720
and variants uh as far as systems you

800
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,080
can go after

801
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,960
and uh you know you're like wow okay

802
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,440
well

803
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,320
what's next here's some more for you

804
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,559
ransomware of the future

805
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,520
right the internet of things so when we

806
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,120
look in the picture we got stuff like

807
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,240
microwaves

808
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,320
you know vacuum cleaners thermostats

809
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,200
cameras all these things that are

810
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
connected

811
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
you know there's a reason why we don't

812
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,520
see security

813
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,919
in like internet of things because one

814
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,320
would argue that they're not secure

815
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,399
but they have so much access and they

816
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,559
become so much a part of our lives

817
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,559
that we could envision that this would

818
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,679
be the next

819
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,320
wave of things and when i say the future

820
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,279
of ransomware

821
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,440
i mean the now of ransomware so there

822
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
was a pen tester at defcon 24 that

823
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,360
successfully compromised the connected

824
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
thermostat they locked

825
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
out the device until the ransom was paid

826
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,039
they had the ability to

827
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,360
change the temperature on the device

828
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
wow if that's not enough for you let's

829
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
check this out so we had an lg tv

830
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,679
that is running android os and it was

831
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,960
hit with ransomware

832
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
this ransomware would pretend to come

833
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
from the fbi

834
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
the rental would charge you 500 in

835
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,679
ransom

836
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,679
but lg would charge you 340.

837
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,360
okay 340 for lg to help me 500

838
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,679
for the ransom in the end lg just

839
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,880
provided the reset

840
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
steps because they didn't want to lose

841
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
customers and everything

842
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
else but your tv is hit

843
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
with ransomware wow the future

844
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,080
is now right and if that's not scary

845
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,559
enough

846
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,399
let's look at the breakdown of internet

847
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,039
of things by the year 2025.

848
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,720
we see business and manufacturing

849
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
leading the weight essentially

850
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,519
with approximately 40 transportation

851
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,200
with 4.1

852
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
this is only going to increase

853
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,120
technology is a great thing

854
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,080
for the user but it's also a great thing

855
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,799
for

856
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,440
ransomware authors and really criminals

857
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,120
at large

858
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,559
so if now you're you're you're not

859
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,120
feeling

860
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,679
safe right because ransomware is

861
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,559
literally

862
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
everywhere right and you're trying to

863
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
tell yourself you'll be okay

864
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,640
um i i think not right so

865
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,720
let me now help you let's talk about the

866
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,600
five stages of ransomware the first one

867
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,919
denial right what do you mean we got hit

868
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,760
with wrestling where you're joking right

869
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,360
nobody will find out about this we can

870
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,279
keep it under wraps you're in denial

871
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,080
that it actually

872
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,760
happened and then you get to the point

873
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,519
where you're just angry

874
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,200
you're telling me this worm didn't sway

875
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,919
into every system including the backups

876
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,519
right you went from denial to anger

877
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,039
about it then you kind of start

878
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,080
bargaining

879
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,559
can the fbi help with this please god

880
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,480
help us get our data back

881
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,080
right because you you become almost

882
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,679
desperate a little bit

883
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,200
then you fall into depression oh this is

884
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,880
probably the end of my career our share

885
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,279
price is down 30

886
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,080
and then the last one you just become

887
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,440
accepting of

888
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,559
right let's go ahead and pay them we all

889
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,399
follow these stages of grief

890
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,720
in the number of things in our life but

891
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,399
they ring true when it comes to

892
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
wrenching

893
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,799
now here's the mitigation techniques or

894
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,360
some

895
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,519
call this the playbook this is going to

896
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,799
sound cliche

897
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,559
you probably have heard this before but

898
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,440
it's the simple things that work

899
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,279
take backups test the backups store them

900
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,240
offline do not store them on the same

901
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,360
network

902
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,640
in which um your data is traditionally

903
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,519
flowing

904
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,559
because if it gets infected

905
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,399
they're just going to move laterally to

906
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,679
affect your backups

907
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,360
again they're going to try to get rid of

908
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,600
those backups because they don't want

909
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,360
you to be able to revert back to them so

910
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,640
quickly

911
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
don't click on links attachments

912
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,320
anything unknown

913
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,720
unexpected um in emails right you want

914
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,559
to implement filters you want to educate

915
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,240
users you want to do it regularly and

916
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
you want to do it very

917
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,080
often you want to utilize some type of

918
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
security software to give

919
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,000
multi-layered protection employ

920
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,279
application white listing

921
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,919
if you can that way you can explicitly

922
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,640
say

923
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
these binaries can execute nothing more

924
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,240
nothing less where applicable were

925
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,440
possible employ

926
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
least privileged that way we don't have

927
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
things like privileged

928
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,960
uh crete or people being able to do more

929
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,480
than what they should

930
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,960
you want to make sure you enforce unique

931
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,399
and strong passwords

932
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,640
don't allow them to be reused and you

933
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,000
want to rotate those

934
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,480
frequently and last but not least we

935
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,000
want to make sure we keep our operating

936
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,200
system up to date

937
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,720
make sure we're updating from trusted

938
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,039
resources validate hashes

939
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,480
were applicable now here's some other

940
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
mitigations and techniques that we can

941
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,919
use

942
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,600
from the perspective of resources online

943
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,480
know before it has the ability to

944
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
install a ransomware simulator on your

945
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,399
machine it doesn't encrypt anything

946
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,119
but it tests for 16 types of scenarios

947
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,639
this works with windows 7

948
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,719
and newer if we look at the screenshot

949
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,879
here it will go through your system and

950
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,079
identify

951
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,199
um files that it could encrypt

952
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,839
if it was actually ransomware gives you

953
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,800
an idea

954
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,159
of the uh state in which you reside

955
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,960
in whether your intrusion detection

956
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,520
system

957
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,239
detected it or nothing was detected of

958
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,800
sorts

959
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,359
so giving you a glimpse into that we

960
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,040
also have no more ransom

961
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,359
this assists with identification of it

962
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,239
so you're

963
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,000
likely always going to have your files

964
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,440
encrypted there's probably going to be

965
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,599
some ransom note but if you have no idea

966
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,399
what's what

967
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,119
you can take um aspects of those things

968
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,000
and be able to

969
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
upload them to no more ransom and it

970
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,680
will help you identify it

971
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,520
there's also about 123 um decrypters on

972
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,079
there

973
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,200
um that will help you decrypt um your

974
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,720
ransomware if you've been hit

975
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,040
i need ransomware same thing helps you

976
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,400
with the identification of the

977
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,280
ransomware

978
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,560
that has hit you roughly over 800

979
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,880
uh rest wear variants on there so you

980
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,000
can quickly

981
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,119
uh identify the ransom uh that's hit

982
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,760
your system

983
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
now we've all seen this pyramid of pain

984
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,800
right how do we get after this pandemic

985
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
right because it's not going anywhere

986
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,800
well again at the bottom the larger

987
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
um the easier it is right we want to get

988
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
to the top of that pyramid of pain

989
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,560
to really affect um ransomware and

990
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,000
really the tactics that people

991
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
use right well how could we do that well

992
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
we can start to nest

993
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,680
really that um cycle if you will

994
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,520
use miter or whatever you feel most

995
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
comfortable with to really

996
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,520
map out some of the things that rents

997
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
aware authors do

998
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,680
we'll see in some cases they utilize the

999
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,320
same

1000
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,240
ttps in other cases it may slightly vary

1001
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,119
so as we look at this example initial

1002
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,400
access

1003
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,960
we have maze ransomware and then we also

1004
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,599
have

1005
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,640
uh robin hood using rdp brute force

1006
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,760
okay do i have anything um rdp

1007
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
accessible uh where somebody could take

1008
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
advantage of this

1009
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,280
right same thing with credential theft

1010
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,599
uh lateral movement persistent

1011
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,960
right if you're lucky enough you'll see

1012
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
stuff like many cats being used and

1013
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,960
you'd be able to

1014
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,040
not only identify it but stop it and

1015
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
then you'd be able to say

1016
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,119
what stage in the campaign somebody is

1017
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,440
at

1018
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
by the time they get to the payload part

1019
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
it's already too late because that's the

1020
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,480
point where

1021
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
they're doing the payload of the

1022
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,079
ransomware but if we could

1023
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,960
identify it early on we may be able to

1024
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
stop it and this is where

1025
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
this uh cyber security programs with

1026
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
multi-layered defense

1027
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
come into play

1028
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,560
so as we round this out and really sum

1029
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,520
everything up here

1030
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,839
why should you pay well fbi has

1031
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,680
previously stated easiest path

1032
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,560
is to pay but you you'll get your files

1033
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:12,960
back

1034
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,640
and i put there maybe because we've

1035
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
already articulated that

1036
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,440
um there's cases in which uh those

1037
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
decrypters don't work

1038
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,440
right it might be cheaper in the long

1039
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
run it's articulated with

1040
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,960
uh atlanta in a number of other cases

1041
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,359
now conversely why should you not pay

1042
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,160
well the us cert and fbi clearly say

1043
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,040
no which contradicts the previous one i

1044
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
recognize that

1045
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
it seems cheaper but it's really not

1046
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,440
because

1047
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,880
you'll have to do some form of the

1048
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
closure and that's not cheap

1049
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
right you're probably going to lose some

1050
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
stock there probably going to

1051
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,200
lose uh some customers um so

1052
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,839
and there's also a target on your back

1053
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,839
if you pay once

1054
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,240
you'll probably pay again whether it's

1055
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,320
the same people coming back at you

1056
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,640
or somebody else now trying to target

1057
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,520
you

1058
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,119
and again there's no guarantee you'll

1059
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,200
get your files back and when we do this

1060
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,680
the criminals they win

1061
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,920
all right so what to do if you've been

1062
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
hit with ransomware

1063
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,400
contact the cyber security specialist

1064
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
research the variant on your own

1065
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,599
check out some of those sites i

1066
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,200
mentioned and a number of other things

1067
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,000
online

1068
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
you may be able to um kind of service

1069
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,760
yourself

1070
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,119
if you will take the machine offline

1071
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,119
make sure you change all passwords and

1072
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,280
wait wait as long as you have to

1073
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,599
right it may feel like a knee-jerk

1074
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,400
reaction

1075
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,320
to hurry up and try to get your data

1076
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,680
back and pay

1077
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,400
or do whatever it takes but you need an

1078
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
opportunity to really think it through

1079
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,400
the best avenue but lastly

1080
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
if you take heed to things like you know

1081
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,720
the passwords

1082
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,760
the updates um making sure you're not

1083
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,839
downloading stuff from specific sites

1084
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,240
and

1085
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,960
the attack surface reducing that you may

1086
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
not find yourself

1087
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,200
in this position i'll say this

1088
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,680
2020 has been a trying gear for all of

1089
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,400
us

1090
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,160
so many people are affected by the

1091
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,200
coronavirus in many many ways

1092
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,000
ransomware is really no different

1093
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,760
whether we're affected with it

1094
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,119
firsthand we're probably two to three if

1095
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:21,440
not

1096
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,720
five entities removed from it

1097
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
there's no end in sight with ransomware

1098
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,880
but each of us can do our part to

1099
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,000
limit its success

1100
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,839
with that i'll bring it to the end

1101
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,079
this presentation will be on my website

1102
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,200
at that link

1103
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,520
um any other programs and stuff that i

1104
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,040
make you'll see on my github

1105
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
and if you want to keep in touch and

1106
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,880
just have like-minded conversations

1107
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,520
about

1108
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,240
anything cyber security related um you

1109
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,440
can find me on twitter

1110
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,320
at wired posts with that thanks for your

1111
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,800
time

1112
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,560
i look forward to meeting each one each

1113
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,839
and every one of you one day
