1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,029
so these sides and stuff this is me

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,940
quick just I'm psyched to be here I

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,430
apparently there is more to Charlotte

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,260
than the walk from terminal D to

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,820
terminal e which is normally from public

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,230
jumpers to the real airplanes and

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,820
vice-versa but so that's kind of cool

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,210
again but here we are

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,930
but first

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:51,679
[Music]

11
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,809
so that was Steven Seagal's they're a

12
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:00,140
Finnish band you should see their videos

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,940
they're beautifully produced videos on

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,230
YouTube if you haven't seen them they're

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,050
amazing they're their video for born to

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,850
be wild is stunning you're welcome

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,880
you aren't here or here there which is

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,430
which is awesome it's great that this

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,170
event has been revived thanks folks but

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,360
one of the things to keep in mind is

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,030
that you're here but you're also here

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,280
and part of this amazing movement of

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,800
events this map is pretty much up to

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,929
date the blue pins have held uh V sides

25
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,610
before the green pins our first time

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,700
once coming up question marks our babies

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,069
the handful that have stars our tenth or

28
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,099
upcoming tenth events a handful events

29
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,640
already had ten Vegas has had eleven but

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,060
more importantly you're part of all of

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,470
this then over ten years ago a few of us

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,709
are kicking around ideas about what

33
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,840
could be better about conferences and

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,300
then people complained about their talks

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,410
being turned down and we get a

36
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,450
conversation and you know the big cons

37
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,629
just get too many talks but we saw some

38
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,849
that we're like interesting but maybe

39
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,410
they weren't gonna fill a room at black

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,270
hat or Def Con because they need to put

41
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,890
a lot of see you know a lot of boats and

42
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,870
seeds that's too bad there would be a

43
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,030
place for these there to be a place for

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,620
people to develop their skills there

45
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,510
ought to be a place for people to hear

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,069
interesting ideas that are maybe

47
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,379
interesting to dozens of people but not

48
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,370
thousands and so we did a one-off event

49
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,099
in July of 2009 and it turns out maybe

50
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,640
it wasn't the one-off this is besides

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,559
event 552 globally since that first

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:04,390
Cardiff Wales current of wheels turns

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,340
from green to blue today they've got a

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,049
five hour time zone head start so

55
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,099
they're well into their conference

56
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,299
that's their first so this has been 552

57
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,709
so far 163 cities in 50 countries

58
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,000
depending on whether we count Scotland

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,180
and Northern Ireland again keeps us from

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,389
focusing on our own seventy-eights

61
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,609
this part of this year and 32 more

62
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,939
schedule that's changed in the few hours

63
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,040
since I finished this deck two days ago

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,859
and 34 more schedule to the left for the

65
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,950
year 112 events this year 15 cities

66
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,290
scheduled will hold their first ones and

67
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,769
it's because as Jenny said of everyone

68
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,379
it's because the organisers because of

69
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,150
the volunteers it's because of those of

70
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,739
you that are here to participate whether

71
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,750
it's participating by being part of the

72
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,150
community its sponsors speakers

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,919
everybody takes everyone to do this and

74
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,650
it's just amazing it's like I don't know

75
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,690
how did this happen and I speak to

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,819
people I speak to like 60 or so teams a

77
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,409
year that want to do an event about the

78
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,108
third of them happened and so we bring

79
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,900
events and mentor events and the local

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,270
teams running all this is that this is

81
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,530
the b-side of Charlotte's Tunes event it

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,659
a connection to an amazing community but

83
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,300
they do all of the hard work but anyway

84
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,000
you know let's let's dig into some deep

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,300
thoughts

86
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,300
I want to talk about the history of

87
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,860
computer security just for a couple of

88
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,910
minutes and give you some thoughts

89
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,770
things to think about

90
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,860
so a very complicated timeline we'll dig

91
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,150
into that somewhere in the middle of

92
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,610
that timeline the NSA decided that they

93
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,750
would have security awareness posters

94
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,960
yes

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,660
that's NSA but they were that's this

96
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,740
last year yes there's a set of a hundred

97
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,780
and thirty-five or so of them available

98
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,909
as a PDF if you ask the internet are

99
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,190
paying me and I can help you most of

100
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,840
them are boring some of them are bizarre

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,699
and more than a few are more than

102
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,130
slightly creepy surprised to hear that

103
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,569
they are propaganda posters for the

104
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,300
inside of the NSA so anyway history of

105
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,169
computer security

106
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,620
I hope this complex timeline hopefully I

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,000
won't lose anybody with this

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,270
but I I can this obviously I can go for

109
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,740
hours on but there's some interesting

110
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,500
things back then computers were rare

111
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,470
huge and expensive and the people that

112
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,630
operated them were treated as clerical

113
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,530
even the guys believe it or not and they

114
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,600
were plentiful and cheap relatively

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,330
speaking now computers are free they're

116
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,770
effectively free that's why there's a

117
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,070
computer with an OS in everything if you

118
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,620
bought light bulbs to have web servers

119
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,840
in them because that's a brilliant idea

120
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,630
what could possibly go wrong it's

121
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,360
cheaper to put a full computer in a full

122
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,730
stack and a full set of vulnerabilities

123
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,720
and exposures in every single thing you

124
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,120
own yeah luckily luckily nobody abuses

125
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,610
that either for criminal purposes or

126
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,080
just to sell a stone wherever because

127
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,169
privacy is dumb what else I don't know

128
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,090
at that end I used to be an auto

129
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,040
mechanic at this in apparently I'm not

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,130
anymore

131
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,330
the one thing I want you to think about

132
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,030
though is the stuff that happened and

133
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,100
the more stuff is why we have an

134
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,220
industry to a large extent back in the

135
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,990
old days computers were insecure but

136
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,430
they weren't that well connected and

137
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,130
they could have been secured okay I mean

138
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,530
single users single process stuff we

139
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,210
started down that path with things like

140
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,430
BP and 10x like I'm the only one here

141
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,840
old enough to know that other than

142
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,180
historian but you know 10x was going to

143
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,220
be really secure and they made some of

144
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,080
the dumbest mistakes you can imagine if

145
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,280
you're really into that thing you know

146
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
I'll give you some papers to dig into

147
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,230
but what happened in the middle well we

148
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,320
started connecting everything that was a

149
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,810
good idea

150
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,600
turns on the Nets of baggage computers

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,310
became commoditized that can became

152
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,889
consumed Erised and then commoditized

153
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,850
and just doing that with the hardware

154
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,620
opened up a lot of attack surface once

155
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,730
we connected everything but then we

156
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,600
consumed Erised and commoditized

157
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,000
software and that was another step in a

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,070
direction that gives us job security and

159
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,470
then the giant step was that we consumed

160
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,390
Erised and commoditize the creation of

161
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,740
software so that any idiot can be a web

162
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,150
developer and they still call themselves

163
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,160
web people even though they're plugging

164
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,960
into the database of everything that

165
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,830
runs your entire organization so I just

166
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,780
do web stuff yeah does your web stuff

167
