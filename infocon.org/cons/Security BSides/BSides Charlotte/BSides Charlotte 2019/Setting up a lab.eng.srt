1
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:50,040
okay can you hear me

2
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,030
gotcha can you hear me fine like this

3
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,110
okay we'll go that way okay so how many

4
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,760
people are professionals in here you

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,510
work okay you work in IT okay how many

6
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,990
people work in security IT security how

7
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,430
many people are trying to work in

8
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,710
security so students great and that

9
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:27,550
gives us an idea all right so first

10
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,760
thing if you trust me if you want the

11
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,220
slides you can get them from there

12
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,720
there's no drive-by downloads do nothing

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,050
preview the URL it's a Google Google

14
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:51,280
Drive link I'll do it for you if you

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,130
want and I'll show you that makes you

16
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,590
feel better

17
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,649
all right so she already said who we are

18
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,990
we own a security agency and we do pen

19
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,110
testing and a lot of times when we're

20
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,640
trying to answer questions for people on

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,288
forums we get the question I want to

22
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,110
learn how to hack so I'm assuming

23
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,490
everyone here is interested in that

24
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,490
that's why you're here and I always tell

25
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,660
them I always get questions what

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,670
certification should I get what courses

27
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,930
do you recommend etcetera said I always

28
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,960
say go to lab in my opinion that's the

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
best way to learn how to do anything get

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,230
hands-on and just do it so that's what

31
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,160
we're gonna talk about today is house

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,440
how to set up hybrid hacking lab

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,140
environments with the cloud we use that

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,680
in our workflow all the time if I wanted

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,330
to start cracking some hashes I'm gonna

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,319
pentest

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,319
so I'll spin up a Cali AWS instance I

38
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
can cram as much GPU and ram and there's

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,850
I want for $5 an hour I can crack hashes

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,920
so why would you want to set up a

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,140
hacking lab environment and of course

42
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,490
number two if you want to learn

43
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,400
penetration testing and hacking one

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,890
thing that gets overlooked sometimes for

45
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,390
you who work in security if you are

46
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,100
consultants is if you want to do a quick

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,410
demo you're on a sales pitch with a

48
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,660
client spin up a VM show them a common

49
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,130
attack most of them most of time that

50
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,959
blows their mind are sure you got the

51
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,260
deal like they've been talking about

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,480
Labs are great in corporate structures

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,970
corporate environments if you want to

54
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,590
improve your blue team skills and learn

55
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,269
how attackers work if you're say a stock

56
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,519
analyst or anything of that nature

57
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,810
setting up a lab and then learning some

58
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,970
of the attacks that the red team as we

59
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,800
call them do and it's a great way to

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,700
improve your defenses and finally

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,290
setting a lab up at your company is

62
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,910
great for practice we do engagements

63
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,769
with clients where we'll set up a lab

64
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,300
with the blue team and we'll walk

65
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,530
through like they talked about purple

66
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,390
teaming with some scenarios but even

67
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,470
within your environment it's a great

68
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,150
thing to do is to set it up and have the

69
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,680
if you have a red side and a blue side

70
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,040
and have them work against each other

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:13,579
find out the weaknesses of each so what

72
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,450
do you need to set up a lab probably

73
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,339
think you need a whole data center right

74
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,500
it kinds of servers and need tons of

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,229
power not necessarily nowadays your

76
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,470
laptop give me your lab your laptop your

77
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,289
desktop servers you can buy service

78
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,060
pretty cheap off of ebay nowadays I've

79
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,100
got two or three of them sitting in the

80
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,590
closet at my house as my lab there I've

81
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,470
got a couple at work that are my lab

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,490
servers are pretty cheap nowadays the

83
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,910
desktop will work yeah it really depends

84
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,520
on what you have what you have access to

85
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,300
and what you're looking to do and so

86
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,430
when you're setting a lab up what kind

87
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,320
of hardware are we looking for and of

88
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,390
course your processor has to support

89
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,280
virtualization again this is

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,510
going towards a laptop type scenario

91
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,670
storage you probably gonna want 256 gigs

92
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,830
because as you guys know when you set up

93
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,680
your virtual machines each of those gets

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,970
a virtual hard drive right and that

95
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,550
takes up space on your disk and

96
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,570
depending on how extensive your lab is

97
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,070
gonna get how much you're trying to

98
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,530
learn that space can quickly add up so I

99
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,100
typically recommend at least 500 gigs

100
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,630
SSDs work better of course they're

101
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,560
faster but they're not a must and your

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,940
RAM you're gonna want at least eight

103
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,400
gigs windows if you're on a Windows box

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,380
takes what two gigs to run by itself and

105
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,180
then you start allocating RAM out to

106
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,400
each of your VMs you're going 18:16 nice

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,570
and that's the hardware you need and

108
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,320
that's essentially it

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,380
and as you know pretty much every modern

110
00:05:52,380 --> 00:06:00,300
laptop has all of those specs right ok

111
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,490
so once you have your Hardware selected

112
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,580
the next thing is you need a host in

113
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,979
your host machine setup you are going to

114
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,960
need your virtual machine software and

115
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,660
we have tons of options for this

116
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,160
if you're using Windows you've got

117
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,570
hyper-v as an option if you use a

118
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,240
Windows 10 Pro we're gonna talk about

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
later how you can get that for free

120
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,620
legally of course you've got hyper-v

121
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,910
there's VirtualBox

122
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,030
we've got VMware and for Linux we got

123
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,650
Xen with hyper-v and VMware being where

124
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,880
being the paid version which is only

125
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,570
like $90 $120 you get the capability you

126
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,720
guys know what checkpoints alright

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,060
anyone not know what a checkpoint is ok

128
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,460
so a checkpoint is essentially when you

129
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,990
build a machine you can checkpoint it

130
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,180
and create an instance at that moment it

131
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,190
copies the how that machine is set up

132
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,570
and then later you want to revert back

133
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,400
to it your lab it's taking over with

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,870
malware you're trying something you

135
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,400
messed something up you just revert back

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,140
to that checkpoint which is a nice

137
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,810
capability but with vien or fuse vmware

138
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,090
it comes with the paid version hyper-v

139
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,940
has it by default so before you start

140
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,620
something new in your lab before you

141
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,840
branch out do it run a checkpoint you

142
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,310
have something to go back to and

143
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,370
we'll get there so now that you have

144
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,830
your VM set up you're gonna have to pick

145
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,040
a distro write an operating system for

146
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,730
your hacking Kali Linux anyone here not

147
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,390
heard of Kali okay I thought so yes

148
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,400
that's the hacking operating system

149
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,130
right and we've got parrot parrot is

150
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,810
essentially I've been playing around

151
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,090
with that one a lot lately in my opinion

152
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,800
it's Kali with a little bit more focus

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,810
on cryptography it's got some

154
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,030
cryptographic tools on it

155
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,140
there's pin two of course back box if

156
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,340
you're looking to get into web we have

157
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,530
the samurai web testing framework if

158
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,610
you're looking to learn more about

159
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,520
forensics we have dephts anybody here

160
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,910
heard of commando vm you played around

161
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:17,710
with it yeah I I didn't know that

162
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,690
commando VM great tool it was released

163
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,910
earlier this year February March time

164
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,370
ish around the time of what's the

165
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,450
conference out in California it's my

166
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,680
main debt and fire I and it is a

167
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,690
windows-based hacking OS it essentially

168
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,630
you download it the stager I guess I'll

169
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,809
call it and it downloads everything else

170
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,150
it installs it and you can run pretty

171
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,740
much anything you can run a Kali you can

172
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,590
run it on a Windows box I use that

173
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,830
recently on a pen test the scenario was

174
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,930
a rogue vendor so I got a laptop like

175
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,970
him and here we get with non admin

176
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,440
credentials and I had to see how far I

177
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,010
could get the network I tried everything

178
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,250
I could to access elevate my access on

179
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,960
that this was a bank

180
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,660
super lockdown I mean I was sticking a

181
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,520
free the laptop in the freezer trying to

182
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,870
do memory dumps and cold boots and

183
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,770
everything I couldn't elevate access but

184
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,810
what I could do when we did finally find

185
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,500
a way around that like so the scenario

186
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,120
was I'm a vendor I can't bring my own

187
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,590
laptop on the network right I have to

188
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,960
use what I have so I downloaded camino

189
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,089
vm put it on the box kept out a couple

190
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:30,290
tools that would have set off flags and

191
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,830
antivirus

192
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,400
I was good to go so yeah commando Vienna

193
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,140
something I would recommend looking into

194
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,910
okay so once you have your lab setup and

195
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,370
you have the operating system of choice

196
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,800
or operating systems the next thing

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,750
you're gonna want to do is find

198
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,970
something to hack right you've got to do

199
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,180
this legally what are we gonna hack the

200
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,860
nice thing is there's tons of vulnerable

201
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,300
systems that you can download to

202
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,830
practice on and you can download these

203
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,140
at any skill level and as you build you

204
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,210
can get harder ones so of course there's

205
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,100
Metasploit able by Metasploit you guys

206
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,940
anyone not hurt a Metasploit good okay

207
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,920
there's morning catch anyone here heard

208
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,310
of morning catch all right so morning

209
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,320
catch is a virtual machine you can

210
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,420
download and it's sort of automated and

211
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,920
it's for learning social engineering and

212
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,150
phishing attacks when you get on a pen

213
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,350
test if that's where you're looking to

214
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,880
go and you're working on social

215
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,860
engineering the last thing you want to

216
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,230
do is make a dumb mistake in your spoof

217
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,510
email that sets it off through my Caesar

218
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,000
right so you can get a BM like morning

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,010
catch and you can practice that so you

220
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,600
have your skills home by time you get to

221
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,020
the job the OWASP broken web

222
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,530
applications anyone anyone here familiar

223
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,350
with a wasp anyone not familiar with Oh

224
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,620
wasps you know okay

225
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,050
so the old wasp I can't remember what it

226
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,910
stands for but every year they do

227
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,490
research based on the top web

228
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,750
vulnerabilities and they release the top

229
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,300
ten the OWASP top 10 we call it most

230
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,190
common vulnerabilities and coding of

231
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,010
websites and so they released that study

232
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,630
every year they're pretty much always

233
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,690
the same cross-site scripting variations

234
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,240
of that etc and they have vulnerable web

235
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,190
apps on their site that you can download

236
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,410
they have a web app testing framework

237
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,640
that's really nice that'll walk you

238
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,010
through how to test for a bunch of these

239
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,760
different things web goat has vulnerable

240
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,830
web apps and then bone hub you guys

241
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,900
heard of own hub they've got tons and

242
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,540
tons of vulnerable instances that you

243
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,870
can download for practicing sometimes

244
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,610
this is overlooked you guys heard of

245
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,660
exploit dB

246
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,579
work with exploit development use an

247
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,079
exploit singer attacks anyone not heard

248
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,699
of exploit dB okay so if you you're on a

249
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:55,430
testing I'm looking at SL mail for an

250
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,589
example that's a pretty old something I

251
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,980
was playing around with recently you can

252
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,509
go there and you can download shell

253
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,009
codes etc that you can put into

254
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,290
Metasploit or just run as an executable

255
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,350
and

256
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,959
elevate privileges get route get access

257
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,230
etcetera sometimes people don't realize

258
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,699
for some of those exploits you can

259
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,100
actually download the version of the

260
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,079
software that it runs on and not all of

261
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,399
them but sometimes they have that and

262
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,959
you can get vulnerable software that way

263
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,370
also and of course outdated operating

264
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,509
systems Windows XP I see that in so many

265
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,269
environments XP Windows 7 is going into

266
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,970
blithe I see old versions of Server last

267
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,069
guy talk about Server 2000 I see that

268
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:42,889
all the time in environments Microsoft

269
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,329
had some O's available for you you can

270
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,829
go download from TechNet in different

271
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:48,079
places and have a way I don't exchange

272
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,800
the same way

273
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,100
okay so you've got the machines and now

274
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,319
you need the tools right there are

275
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,730
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

276
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,449
hacking tools

277
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,149
yeah you know so we can't go through

278
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,709
them all I'm just gonna go through some

279
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,649
of the basics there's n map I'm sure

280
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,790
everybody hears heard of a map right

281
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,970
Network mapping

282
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,059
Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that's

283
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,309
a paid tool but they recently released a

284
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,290
free version previously it was a home

285
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,110
version and you can scan up to 16 or 24

286
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,230
machines just plenty for a lab responder

287
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,379
you guys know about responder okay so

288
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,809
I'm responder essentially it does an ARP

289
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,630
spoof in it spoofs you can get into get

290
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,639
ntlm hatches you can get SMB

291
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,500
authentication

292
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,040
you can do DNS spoofing with it if I

293
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,360
want to pin cash there in a Windows

294
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,820
environment a lot of times I'll run

295
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,690
responder to try to in the

296
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,570
authentication of course ntlm b2 is the

297
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,200
most up-to-date version but a lot of

298
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,090
times you can force it to downgrade to

299
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,310
an ntlm you can grab those hashes of

300
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,470
their credentials and they login so I

301
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,180
like to run that on a pin test if I'm on

302
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,410
site I'll start in the morning when

303
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,990
there everybody is getting there for 10

304
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,300
to 15 minutes at the most because it can

305
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,610
get pretty messy ARP spoofing caused a

306
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,030
lot of problems yeah well I'll do it at

307
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,960
lunchtime oh I'm back from lunch

308
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
I'll run responder I can usually pull

309
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,610
five the caches there and then I'll send

310
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,860
them up to start getting cracked yeah

311
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,070
John the Ripper for password cracking

312
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,870
it's pretty old when everybody knows

313
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,870
about it and there's others patch cat

314
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,350
there's quite a few password cracking

315
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,780
anybody here heard of pret critter

316
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,300
exploitation toolkit it's a really

317
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,060
really nice tool as you know what's

318
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,250
there typically the two weakest points

319
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:18,220
of a network printers and Hawaii yeah

320
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,839
printers and void I can you can pretty

321
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,310
much always get in printers of what they

322
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,780
never setup right they're using old

323
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,030
technology or easy way and so for

324
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,730
printers a gentleman I believe is from

325
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,440
Sweden

326
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,390
Jen's molar he developed the printer

327
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,400
exploitation toolkit essentially what it

328
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,450
allows you to do is it uses the printer

329
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,810
PC J&P Co commands and you can connect

330
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,720
to a printer and copy off print jobs

331
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,339
come to the printer all day don't need

332
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,020
to dumpster dive anymore right you just

333
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,190
go to the printer and see what they

334
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,380
print it's a really nice tool Metis

335
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,910
point everybody's heard of Metasploit

336
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,800
again these are just basic tools there's

337
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,160
tons and tons more social engineers tool

338
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,830
kit you guys heard of that anyone not

339
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,910
heard of it okay so Dave Kennedy who was

340
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,459
earlier that is a tool developed by them

341
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:10,970
and it's

342
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,459
it allows you to create payload it

343
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,129
documents you can spoof emails with it

344
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:18,920
it's a social engineering toolkit nice

345
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,500
go fish is another another one I use

346
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,970
I've got a couple VMs up in the cloud

347
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,399
that I run that off of and what's nice

348
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
about go fish is you have an email you

349
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,410
want a copy of course you're gonna spoof

350
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,839
it so I can copy the HTML code of a

351
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,029
gmail email for example I can put it

352
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,579
into here and sin that I can also if I

353
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,649
want to mimic a landing page I just put

354
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,420
in the URL and it will copy the code and

355
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,589
make a landing page for me that looks

356
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,319
just like it so yeah I want to send them

357
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,029
the Facebook to log in put in the

358
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,160
facebook URL log in URL and it copies it

359
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,680
you got to work with it yeah yeah I've

360
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,680
had very various success rates tweaking

361
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,380
things you can get it to work it depends

362
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,089
on what email client or user so using

363
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,349
the exchange on Prem PowerShell Empire

364
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,089
so that these three are post

365
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,939
exploitation Metasploit can be post

366
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,970
exploitation to probably pret also

367
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,900
you're gonna have to be on the network

368
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,209
PowerShell Empire is a offensive

369
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,620
PowerShell toolkit tons and tons of nice

370
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,669
tools in there nice commands you can run

371
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,870
what you have to watch out for with that

372
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,789
is as these things become more common

373
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,710
they get picked up by the antivirus

374
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,990
companies or the endpoint protection and

375
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,120
the a lot of times they are caught like

376
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,870
me me cats

377
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,370
pretty much everyone catches me me cats

378
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,309
nowadays the Kerberos toolkit is a nice

379
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,799
toolkit and I'm sure working on Active

380
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,140
Directory environments I'm it

381
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,880
everyone everyone heard of a Kerberos

382
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,780
attack were you essentially the short of

383
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
it is everyone else how Kerberos works

384
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,419
right

385
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:04,549
with to get granting servers and you get

386
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:05,840
a ticket and you use your ticket to

387
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,659
authenticate throughout the network

388
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,250
well there's golden tickets which give

389
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,309
you elevated access in Kerberos attack

390
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,440
is you find a service account I mean

391
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,789
there's multiple ways to do it

392
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,470
typically what works for us is we find a

393
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,990
service account you pull down the

394
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,299
Kerberos you request a Kerberos ticket

395
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,500
for that service account

396
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,080
anyone can do it windows will unless

397
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,120
they blur security really ramped up

398
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,480
anyone can pull down the Kerberos ticket

399
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,010
and it goes to RAM then you use me me

400
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,480
cats for another tool to dump out of RAM

401
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,830
and crack it then you have the

402
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,210
credentials for a service account and

403
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,950
then you can use that to elevate and get

404
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,690
a golden ticket and then if you're at

405
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,180
that point you're doing pretty well and

406
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,970
then cracked mac crack map exec is

407
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,170
another powershell toolkit it's nice to

408
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,050
use post exploitation and again these

409
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,820
are just a few out of hundreds and

410
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,190
hundreds of tools and what i would say

411
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,480
when you're using these tools is

412
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,860
understand what they're doing and how

413
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,130
they work nobody wants to be called a

414
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,500
script kitty for one but for two when

415
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,690
you get into an environment your

416
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,190
environment change like that pen test

417
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,900
I've talked about I was on I had a

418
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,330
Windows box low-level access I could not

419
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,950
run PowerShell I couldn't download or

420
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,870
install any tools I couldn't do memory

421
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,470
dumps because of my access so I could

422
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,120
run command prompt so essentially what I

423
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,920
did is I wrote first thing I did is I

424
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,690
wrote in map in a Windows command prompt

425
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,910
and created my own tool I know how it

426
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,300
works

427
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,300
and I ran out as a batch file I had a I

428
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,250
could do that so learn how the tools

429
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,560
work and then you can retrofit it to

430
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,419
your environment what you're up against

431
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,130
then I would say in your lab learn

432
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,610
active directory what is it 87 percent

433
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,320
of organizations 85 or something like

434
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,630
that that use Windows as their systems

435
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,610
so you're gonna come up against Active

436
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,590
Directory you're gonna deal with Active

437
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,070
Directory so build a domain anyone here

438
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,140
not dealt with Active Directory not set

439
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,750
up a domain you but you understand how

440
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:18,110
domains work right gotcha so essentially

441
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,540
you have your domain controller and then

442
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,430
you have different levels of access you

443
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,240
have groups

444
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:39,210
right and that regulates everything yeah

445
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,590
cuz most the times it's not set up

446
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,559
securely so it's pretty easy to get it

447
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,620
can be a great benefit for attackers so

448
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,630
build out a domain and we're gonna show

449
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,890
you how you can get that for free to do

450
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,300
that because Windows Server is very

451
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,940
expensive set up various users set up

452
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,340
access levels set up groups and then so

453
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,450
you're getting a couple benefits from

454
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,220
this for one you're understanding more

455
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,890
deeply how when those works for two as

456
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,809
you set this up you can see what common

457
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:04,710
people are doing a could see the

458
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,580
mistakes that they were most likely

459
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,770
making and how you can take advantage of

460
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,120
that the guy before showed the the event

461
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,920
views that's a that's a great example

462
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,260
once you see how the admins work how

463
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,700
they look at that then you start getting

464
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,570
an idea of how you can undermine it

465
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,830
practice with GPL is group policy

466
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,710
objects seeing how you can attack those

467
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,179
get around them the hacker playbook is a

468
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,620
book but on their website they have a

469
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,150
great tutorial how to set up a Windows

470
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,970
domain and then there's another great

471
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,960
tutorial that walks you through the

472
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,850
entire process of the basics setting up

473
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,850
the domains if you don't trust it to me

474
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,050
and copy the link those are in there

475
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,760
so if you want to set up Active

476
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,190
Directory domains how can you get it

477
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,920
server is very expensive right has

478
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,940
anyone here heard of the windows

479
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,559
evaluation center anyone not heard of it

480
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,600
okay so Windows evaluation center

481
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,460
basically every operating system they

482
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,780
make you can get it free for 180 days

483
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,679
server Windows Windows Enterprise all of

484
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,300
them you can get them free for 180 days

485
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,940
and what Microsoft tells you when you

486
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,410
download it and install it set up a

487
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,000
checkpoint the beginning one hundred

488
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,350
eighty eight hundred hundred and eighty

489
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,760
days runs up revert back to your

490
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,780
checkpoint and you're good for another

491
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,170
hundred eighty eight 180 days fully

492
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,600
legal and it's a great way to learn

493
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,830
so of course what we've talked about is

494
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,029
we can build all of this on our own

495
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,889
hardware but where it gets very

496
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:43,419
interesting and fun is when you start

497
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:46,570
using the cloud with cloud computing

498
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,320
nowadays it's super super cheap Amazon

499
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,549
AWS instance is a sure anybody here

500
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,059
heard of vulture vulture hosting I like

501
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:00,129
them one of the reasons I like them so

502
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,580
much for one they're cheap and you can

503
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,769
upload your own ISO so if you've had

504
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,210
you have your own operating system that

505
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,830
you've customized and built say you've

506
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,090
got Ubuntu with your own tools you like

507
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,159
build an ISO of it and then you can put

508
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,479
it up there in the cloud also one house

509
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,909
one host clout there another good one

510
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:21,970
because they allow pretty cart pretty

511
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,470
much any type of pentesting you want to

512
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,570
do on your own environment that's so

513
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,759
long as you're not ddossing or tossing

514
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,820
and we're gonna look at the those in a

515
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,049
little bit more in a second but then

516
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,700
capture the flags you guys are all aware

517
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,109
of capture the flags right there's

518
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,570
online ones you can use to learn pack

519
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,879
the box everybody's heard of pack the

520
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,919
Box played with them got in of course

521
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,139
there's a little challenge to get in but

522
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,389
there's tutorials to help you hack the

523
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:51,340
world over the wire you guys sort of

524
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,190
over the wire so if you're wanting to

525
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,139
learn Linux I tell everybody go check

526
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,190
out over the wire

527
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,249
essentially you SSH on to it and then

528
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:03,970
you have to find tokens hidden on the

529
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,090
computer and each token is your SSH key

530
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,460
for the next level and you learn all

531
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,379
kinds of Linux it's a great tool and

532
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:15,209
then you keep progressing up the ranks

533
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:21,239
all right so

534
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,510
as you can see you are allowed to pen

535
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,600
test your environments on AWS as long as

536
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,440
you are not doing DDoS and if you are

537
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,539
using any of those types of instance

538
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,450
this you are allowed to pen test your

539
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,940
own environment you can't do DNS zone

540
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,700
walking daxing port flooding protocol

541
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,740
flooding or requests flying but other

542
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,820
than that you can do what you want on

543
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,340
your own instance and they're pretty

544
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,149
cheap they even have a Kelly eye so that

545
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:53,220
you could AWS gives you that you can

546
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,080
install on your instance if you want

547
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,799
this is vulture I was talking about I've

548
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,990
got a couple c2 servers sitting up on

549
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:09,090
vulture that I use that's the $10 a

550
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,240
month there's another one at $5 a month

551
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,380
it's pretty cheap and it's $5 a month

552
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,519
it's a gig of ram 25 gb of storage it's

553
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,720
great for a lab so if you don't have

554
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,490
access to hardware which we pretty much

555
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,980
all do but that is another option and as

556
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,049
you start doing more pen testing like I

557
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,789
said we've got a couple c2 servers

558
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:36,539
sitting up on vulture about as much as

559
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:46,500
I'll say about that and then some books

560
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,710
that are great for learning Georgia

561
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,960
Weidman she wrote the book penetration

562
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,700
testing a hands-on introduction to

563
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,630
hacking that is a great book it's a

564
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,919
little old but if you learn the

565
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,889
principles they still apply of course

566
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:04,529
the hacker playbook by Peter Kim that is

567
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,510
at version 3 now that's another great

568
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,080
resource blackhat Python one thing I

569
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,639
like about that book is they teach you

570
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,260
like I talked about learning how your

571
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,299
tools work one of the exercises in that

572
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:16,830
book is building your own in map out of

573
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,570
Python they teach a lot of nice things

574
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,809
in there hacking the art of exploitation

575
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,899
all of them those are great books you

576
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:28,320
guys sort of kevin Mitnick his book is

577
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,500
great for social engineering it can

578
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,480
broaden your understanding hero to some

579
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,150
unorthodox methods you can take I'd say

580
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,530
the same thing for the social engineers

581
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,540
playbook by Jeremiah and tell'em antes

582
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,190
you guys heard of him

583
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,980
red team secure about of Minnesota they

584
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,330
do a lot of physical pen testing and a

585
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,130
lot of social engineering it's a great

586
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,480
book he just released another one on

587
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:57,970
physical pen testing that's good and

588
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,880
then of course this is only the

589
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,740
beginning you've got your lab and you're

590
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,900
working on it

591
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,610
security is a constant lifelong learning

592
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,090
right I guess how I got onto the train

593
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,430
was back in high school a friend of mine

594
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,620
got hacked I said wow that was neat I

595
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,110
want to do that I've been learning ever

596
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,430
since that's how I got started

597
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,640
cyber Erie you guys heard of cyber right

598
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,860
cyber is a wonderful resource I mean

599
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,090
there's tons and tons I've only picked

600
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,160
out a few hacker one now you guys

601
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,400
familiar with bug bug hunting hacker one

602
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,850
anyone not heard of hacker one okay so

603
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,680
they'll pay you of course for bugs have

604
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,880
you guys seen their hacker one

605
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,020
University the intro to web hacking yeah

606
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,890
it's a I think it's on the once you log

607
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,300
in when did you set up a count a ton of

608
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,340
right I believe I'm looking at the

609
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,190
hacker one University bug crowd you guys

610
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,630
have a bug crowd same thing as hacker

611
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,240
one they have a universe it's called a

612
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,620
university they have tons and tons of

613
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,430
videos that teach you web exploitation

614
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,860
YouTube there's tons and tons of great

615
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,980
channels on YouTube I'd say check out

616
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,360
all the Derby con videos from the

617
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,700
previous derbycon conferences as many

618
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,160

619
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,070
great talks at those all the DEF CON are

620
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,440
great and then a couple of the recent

621
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,860
ones I've been looking at some cyber

622
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,120
mentor Heath Adams from here in

623
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,400
Charlotte he spoke earlier his channel

624
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,450
is great you guys heard of C choir they

have a lot of nice tutorials memory

629
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,900

blogs a lot of blocks have a lot of

631

of hands-on tutorials walked you through

635
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,419
he's got a whole series on Wi-Fi hacking

636
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,270
he'll walk you through a WPA hack WPS

637
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,000

great tutorials he also teaches courses

639
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,039
I've never taken any up to you to figure

640
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,539
out trusted SEC has great tutorials Dave

641
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,429
was here you guys heard a Black Hills

642
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:17,380
InfoSec they have a lot of great

643
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,840
tutorials too and they got a lot of good

644
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,510
information on Kerberos they have a lot

645
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,809
of good blue team tutorials too how to

646
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,990
set up honey service accounts so that

647
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,610
should someone try to do a Kerberos

648
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,610
attack you can set up service accounts

649
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,770
that automatically alert someone's using

650
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,890
this because only an attacker would and

651
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,620
then Metasploit Unleashed is a course on

652
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,240
the Metasploit website that's a great

653
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,090
place for learning and I'm sure you guys

654
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,799
