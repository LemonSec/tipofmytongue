you sir

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,940
ten years ago Jack Daniels came up to me

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,430
in Boston and he said hey there's this

5

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:27,999
besides crazy yeah so two things you

8
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,910
guys need to know other than besides is

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,820
one this talk is on breaking and

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,190
entering into information security into

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,770
this field in this community it is a

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,740
call to those of us who are here and a

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,000
call to those of us who are coming in

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,550
that's number one number two is I'm

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,310
wrong I know I'm wrong I'm totally wrong

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,160
and so this is the most right wrong

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,110
you're gonna hear but but when I said

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,790
things you don't like you can hit me up

19
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,110
on Twitter you can talk to me afterwards

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,060
I would love to hear what I'm missing

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,040
I'd love to get better at this because

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,900
we need to get better at getting people

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,869
in a lot of my background comes from

24
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,369
something that I did for about four

25
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:08,799
years I was very proud of that's me in

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,840
the right and that's a whole bunch of

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,420
kids we ran a thing called CBI Academy

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,240
for a consulting firm in Detroit we did

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,490
it for about four years it was great it

30
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,829
was fun there was a two-year program get

31
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,119
these people in we had a lot of

32
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,859
applicants like 55 for every one person

33
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,740
we hired it so hard to get in and then

34
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,539
we trained them up and we do shadowing

35
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,520
and we jump in to do things we'd fire

36
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,799
jump and a new pen testing in blue team

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,240
and I are and all sorts of generic

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,319
little work

39
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,020
so a lot of fun and that gave me a good

40
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,609
perspective about what it takes to get

41
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,770
in the industry today of course meant

42
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,710
duo and that's been the right

43
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,310
it's it's a little bit different with a

44
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,890
lot of lot of senior people in the feel

45
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,540
a lot of expert people I get to hear

46
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,990
about things from that perspective right

47
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,360
and when you get a group of Cecil's

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,530
together maybe more me like what's a

49
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,020
group of see sociology like birds flock

50
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,110
of birds I know that's not in school now

51
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,060
that's that's a fish or something that a

52
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,470
lot of us get this gift to give in this

53
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,459
industry huh

54
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,310
no it's it's a snooze of see social

55
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,270
engagement wandering is exhausting so

56
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,970
this talk is fundamentally aimed at to

57
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,360
audiences is aimed at our folks who are

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,640
in this industry who are at the peak of

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
our careers and it seemed a lot of other

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,300
folks who are coming in its up with that

61
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,640
one who doesn't like avocado toast

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,190
what is it against avocado juice know

63
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,780
whenever I hear people complain about

64
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,670
Millennials I can't help but remember

65
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,680
when I was in the 90s and first being

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,000
started out when I was in the nineties

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
the first game started I was always a

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,510
youngest man on every team I never got

69
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,910
the joke I still don't quite understand

70
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,970
10x I would love to understand it but I

71
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,070
think back to what it was like when my

72
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,440
generation was coming in and we had a

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,930
lot of things against us you may say hey

74
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,180
Millennials are entitled they're lazy

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,510
they're unfocused or antisocial and I

76
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,640
was saying different work it was 67 of

77
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,170
them or the past few years they're

78
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,660
fantastic and they're creative but I

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,450
remember as a gen Xer hearing that we

80
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,850
were cynical that were slackers and were

81
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,670
angsty and disrespectful and today I'll

82
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,209
say yeah you're right I mean

83
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:35,109
but we have jobs and you go back right

84
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,700
the generation before they had their

85
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,349
moment they had their moment their time

86
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,430
unusual to do you go back one generation

87
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,829
later in the greatest generation I just

88
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,359
take a moment and look at these people

89
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,650
who look at these people staring at

90
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,209
their devices not talking to people

91
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:58,689
isolated here's a quote and I love this

92
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,430
called kids love luxury these days

93
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,769
they're disrespectful they have contempt

94
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,500
for authority they love to chat I mean

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,560
text messaging if you guys know who said

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,040
this quote yeah very close

97
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,310
the answer was Plato the actual answer

98
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,759
is Socrates off by one generation sees a

99
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,620
generational Socrates fifth century BCE

100
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,960
is complaining about kids these days he

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,070
was actually complaining about play

102
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,280
though

103
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,879
the thing is that I would argue that all

104
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,249
young generations are screwed up we all

105
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:36,719
are we all are the difference isn't in

106
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:38,459
whether or not we're screwed up this

107
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,559
hour how much we're screwed up it's the

108
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,199
difference in which way and it's that

109
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,729
which way that allows us your orange

110
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,469
juice toast now you may be wondering

111
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,749
okay that's fine Plato Socrates all

112
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:50,399
these sort of things I'm not here to

113
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,259
learn about the history of generations

114
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,759
over here to learn about computers so

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,049
let's bring it down to computers for

116
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,919
just a moment we are in this fantastic

117
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,229
industry where our entire job is to sing

118
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,599
to the computer that's all we do we sing

119
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,089
to the computer we sing in code we same

120
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,519
configuration we sing a song that we

121
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,189
hope will honor the computer so that my

122
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:12,929
phone will work and I can get up damn

123
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:18,649
lift or other things that may happen and

124
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,759
it's so much of our computers today

125
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,079
right I mean it's either in the clouds

126
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,399
we don't get to touch anymore which is

127
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,439
kind of a bummer it's a it's a Mac or

128
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,989
it's a Windows box I got my new job and

129
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,429
they're like what box do you want and my

130
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,689
boss like if you say Windows you're

131
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,019
fired

132
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,169
a while ago I was looking and it really

133
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,179
surprised me to learn that like Bill

134
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,829
Gates and Steve Jobs were born in the

135
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:41,309
same year

136
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,559
they're like months apart I mean that's

137
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,669
pretty cool that's weird

138
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,279
right that's weird why are they so close

139
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,749
to major Steve Wozniak a little bit

140
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,459
older that's okay these are like the

141
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,259
quintessential geeks who define so much

142
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,939
of our technology what was happening and

143
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,610
the 50s and in you know when they came

144
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,769
into the workforce in the early 70s late

145
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:02,069
60s that allowed them to be so freaking

146
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,519
: to find the technology and and who

147
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,719
else was around there there's some other

148
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,249
cool people there's like rowdy a

149
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,689
Pearlman if you don't know her check her

150
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,559
out she defined network routing tcp/ip

151
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,489
spanning tree

152
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:16,169
she's from MIT there would be no

153
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,439
internet without her there was a Richard

154
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,390
Stallman factor

155
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,490
19:53 bill joy pentesters in the room

156
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,900
can we all agree Chow is the gift that

157
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,010
keeps giving thank you bill joy right

158
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,810
Tim berners-lee also did a fantastic

159
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,570
thing he invented the web but also

160
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,000
pertinent to our conversation in the

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,620
original web proposal this is a straight

162
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,390
line this as a project is bubble blots

163
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,220
the way of all the things projects not

164
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,830
security no security

165
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,690
I'm at that's fantastic thank you first

166
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,340
day one saying yeah we're not going to

167
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,840
secure it and then we're gonna run Java

168
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,850
yes right there hanging out there

169
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,310
learning the doing cool stuff 60s come

170
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,720
around we're not good we're gonna skip

171
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,020
over that and then they're coming of age

172
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,910
in the day where you don't have to use

173
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,440
the punch cards anymore the computers

174
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,940
actually look like the appears we know

175
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,250
monitors keyboards cool stuff they're

176
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,900
not big buildings they're not arcane

177
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,790
stuff you can touch them and right

178
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,440
around that time the word hacker comes

179
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
into being 1963

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,419
1963 first use of the word hacker in an

181
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,900
MIT press book ornamenting paper right

182
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,960
the tech and I love this because right

183
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
off the bat hackers are like yeah we

184
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,590
messed up the system the phones right

185
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,880
right off the bat we're not necessarily

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,430
the good guys but we're curious we're

187
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,470
creative we're doing cool things so you

188
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,669
look you look at the dictionary

189
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,640
definition of hacker today of course

190
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,690
there's always a picture of a person

191
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,479
with a hoodie I won't honor the person

192
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,970
with the hoodie I've got my own hacker

193
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,530
buddy it's a key from b-side Charlotte's

194
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,060
like my favorite buddy but I see the

195
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,820
hair to there it's pretty warm I'm sorry

196
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,669
besides Charleston but but the

197
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,010
definition emphasis mine an expert at

198
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,390
programming in solving problems in the

199
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,979
beginning is all about programming our

200
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,740
song to the computer was in programming

201
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,270
is if he couldn't program and it wasn't

202
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,490
going to do a thing wasn't gonna do

203
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,310
anything and that really defined what

204
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,440
started a lot of people off in this

205
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,810
career off in this path I'm gonna define

206
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,310
generations this way I'm not using

207
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,080
Millennials and baby boomers I think

208
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,940
that's gonna be a good touch n0 it

209
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,820
sounds more hacker chant 0 those born in

210
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,909
the 1950s and wintered the workforce in

211
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,440
the 60s and 70s

212
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,140
Gen 1 seventies eighties my people my

213
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,969
people did a look array however here's

214
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,349
not quite long enough the ëthe Orkut and

215
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,620
it was a little what was happening when

216
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,089
we were joining the internet happened

217
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,330
and it was great the way I got in to

218
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,240
this industry is not illegal today

219
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,670
toaster theaters time didn't it but but

220
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,740
it was like hey you look like a hacker

221
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,850
I'm like I'm - you are feeling nice -

222
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,660
you have long hair can you sing the

223
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,730
computer I can sing the computer and he

224
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,520
had a job that was I needed so cute kids

225
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,930
these days with your whole college

226
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,150
degree no we were walking uphill to ways

227
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,280
and getting a job because we look like a

228
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,440
hacker 90s and the people that I've been

229
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,790
working with the six or seven people

230
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,339
that apprenticeship program are coming

231
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:26,870
into this in a very interesting

232
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,959
inflection point it's now a career you

233
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,330
come out with a degree there's this

234
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,130
talent shortage we hear about millions

235
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,020
of jobs unfulfilled and then you have a

236
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,250
degree you sit there going if there's

237
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,480
millions of jobs unfulfilled

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
I'll come have a job

239
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,240
right it's frustrating um so these are

240
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,550
waves right there's differences and when

241
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,170
I'm talking about gen zero one two and

242
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,370
three I'm talking about people around

243
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,230
that time who face different and

244
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,550
interesting technical challenges and

245
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,069
different interesting waves that propel

246
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,199
their careers forward these were the

247
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,339
waves that propelled their careers

248
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,860
forward but back to the computers this

249
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,870
is this is the state of our industry

250
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,819
this is the state of our community and

251
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,410
this is the history and that we're

252
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,480
bringing forward in and a lot of the

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,190
conversations we have do they tend to be

254
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,480
around those sort of things

255
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,649
wait a minute you don't know how to

256
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,220
program you don't know how to rinky why

257
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,930
would I need to run cables right it's in

258
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,060
the cloud kids he stays it over as a

259
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:31,009
cloud of someone else's computer like

260
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,110
Amazon I actually recently tore down my

261
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,670
entire home lab it was beautiful

262
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,310
a half a rack I loved it my daughter

263
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,630
when she was little did not quite

264
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,029
understood what I did I thought she digs

265
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,829
we'd have conversations and she died and

266
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:45,569
she'd get really excited it was one time

267
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:46,649
when she had her friends or where she

268
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,510
went

269
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,040
do you know the Internet and her friends

270
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,670
like yeah I do

271
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,880
come here my dad has in this room

272
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,019
[Music]

273
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,390
the the point is of course that so much

274
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,310
of it is changed right and today that

275
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,170
title lab is gone is powered off it's on

276
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,520
the cloud why it's pennies on the dollar

277
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,070
why would you do that this is the state

278
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,570
of our industry this is the state of our

279
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,220
community - - let's talk about a little

280
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,830
bit more about the people bill joy bill

281
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,330
joy UNIX VI has anyone decided what the

282
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,640
right better is is the VI worst on going

283
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,380
bill joy bill joy right this is Paige

284
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,209
from UC Berkeley they'll do I had a

285
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,490
ranging thing quote he said he said you

286
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,770
know what when I started competing it

287
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,750
was awesome because you could program

288
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,290
and the punch cards were going away he's

289
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,570
like if I had started University two

290
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,950
years earlier and had learned a punch

291
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,270
card out of an out I would an

292
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,300
astrologist an accountant those terrible

293
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,830
terrible back in the day right but he

294
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,230
had just the right time where he had

295
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,610
access to computers he could practice

296
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,160
giving homeless crafts he could build a

297
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,080
lot of the foundational technologies

298
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,300
that we run on and he had to can't you

299
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,010
he's like hey I want to be an Internet

300
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,390
and today look like I want to be an

301
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,260
Internet find Wi-Fi oh they didn't

302
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,500
provision Wi-Fi connect to cellular boom

303
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,190
I'm on slow okay bill Joy's like I need

304
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,410
to get Internet six months of his life

305
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,700
right a tcp/ip driver

306
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,420
jeez ouch he is this quote though that I

307
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,100
think is pertinent to this section it's

308
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,530
called build rose law they'll Jose law

309
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,790
no matter who you are

310
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,530
most the smartest people work for

311
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,590
somebody else I love that I guess able

312
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,330
to go out to most of smartest people or

313
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,030
somewhere else and it's it's pertinent

314
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,310
to building products because you know

315
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,200
you got to really know what you're doing

316
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,550
in folks on your strengths it's also

317
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,230
very pertinent to hiring because it's

318
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,000
very hard to hire because all the smart

319
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,550
people are with somebody else and we do

320
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,470
this all the time right a million jobs

321
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,600
unfulfilled according to CEO so three

322
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,580
million jobs unfulfilled occurred is C

323
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,060
squared

324
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,469
I'm sure there's no conflict of interest

325
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,230
and there's there's zero percent

326
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,610
unemployment right we hear this all the

327
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,650
time all the times drummed into our head

328
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,750
this is great there's no you know

329
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,120
possibly and it sounds really exciting

330
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,070
but in the beginning you guys may have

331
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,680
heard that I said Mike Adam II programs

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,770
I had 55 qualified applicants for it one

333
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,460
person hired so what is going on why

334
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,160
where is this disconnect okay and 55

335
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,560
people job searching but we have 0%

336
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,260
unemployment in many jobs so that's what

337
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,120
we'll look at next this is one of my

338
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,700
Academy teams this we hired in small

339
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,520
teams and about every three to four

340
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,380
months we bring him in the team they get

341
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,880
together they work on project it was

342
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,950
really interesting with doing it some of

343
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,420
these folks because those are hard to

344
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,270
get in have really went very far Annie

345
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,520
over here for the longest time was on my

346
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,340
people took the compliance in GRC like a

347
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,020

351
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,500
oh my god you're amazing she has since

352
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,790
left the fifth largest credit union in

353
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,320
Michigan now has her as their head of

354
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,850
compliance

355
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,529
a few years and she's a waitress when

356
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,199
she joined us you know really stubborn

357
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,310
person

358
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,170
Chelsea Caleb will also went on to do

359
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,029
great things Jake in the end is now a

360
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,360
manager in for Detroit casino protecting

361
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,430
them and you know they've got money and

362
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:48,569
things that people wanna steal just let

363
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:53,040
me borrow the bag okay I promise

364
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,130
so we're like you know 220 people we

365
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,889
interviewed to hire this team I don't

366
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,930
think we have a town church we say that

367
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,040
all the time we have a town charter you

368
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,690
can't back down with ten find talent I

369
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,569
would argue we have a hiring problem we

370
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,790
have a hiring problem in a big way and

371
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,550
it starts with this it starts with going

372
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,050
hey you look like a happier let me hire

373
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,910
you right we want to hire on the same

374
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,550
people who look like us right we want to

375
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,750
hire the same people who looked like

376
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,310
someone who's already in the role and

377
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,839
it's a cognitive bias I'm gonna jump

378
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,290
into cognitive biases in a minute bit of

379
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,180
a background real quick if you're

380
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,560
getting in you're like hey what skills

381
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,269
do I need to learn I'm not gonna say you

382
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,040
need to know how to program a tcp/ip

383
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,740
driver know you need to know things like

384
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,730
cognitive biases

385
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,100
how do people think how can we have to

386
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,779
keep in mind so much of the problems

387
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,189
that we face state security our last

388
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,170
mile problems how do we get the people

389
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,319
to actually do the thing so hiring back

390
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,970
to her a couple different things here

391
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,630
one like me bias people are hardwired to

392
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,569
like people who look like us or look

393
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,639
like someone who's pro on the team

394
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,089
hey John is awesome therefore I heard

395
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,220
bill who looks like John bill must also

396
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,380
be awesome so weird quirk in our human

397
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,720
brains how it works

398
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,860
performance bias is similar we're

399
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,130
hardwired to go hey you look like me you

400
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,670
therefore perform better right wait a

401
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,200
minute

402
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,790
really I don't know but it doesn't

403
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,320
matter because we got a choice support

404
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,300
bias which is the managers greatest

405
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,570
trick tree striker manager ever did the

406
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,770
about every manager you ever worked for

407
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,960
that you didn't like he was always sure

408
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,920
he is right right choice support bias my

409
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,040
choices are fantastic literally bill is

410
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,540
good luck John even though bill sucks

411
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,800
then what else to do this work

412
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,150
no offense bill so how do you handle

413
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,560
these biases how do you work around some

414
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,970
tips and tricks for getting better

415
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,110
people into the industry

416
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,440
one is as promoting the job descriptions

417
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,110
are terrible right thou shalt have 10

418
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,980
years of experience since the beginning

419
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,090
yes for an entry-level job that you will

420
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,640
also be drawing lift on just to make

421
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,300
your bills oh by the way I hope you can

422
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,790
run to roll your own tcp/ip driver

423
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,619
so one thoughtful Job Description I

424
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,599
think as we become an industry we're

425
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,160
trying to standardize what the jobs are

426
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,839
and that's almost like antithetical to

427
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,119
hacker this right everyone in this room

428
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,589
should not fall into like three

429
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,869
different job categories everyone has

430
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,980
different backgrounds different skills

431
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,420
different aptitudes have things you like

432
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,030
different things you know that do the

433
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,560
thing you like want the Java scripts to

434
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,030
be grated like hey looking for awesome

435
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,220
people and you're gonna do the thing you

436
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,310
like and what we don't like we will find

437
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,200
someone who wants that down the include

438
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,270
job description so one we do better job

439
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,560
descriptions too we need better

440
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,480
recruiting we recruit all the same pool

441
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,000
all the time and it makes sense I mean

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,110
we got a lot here we got all the people

443
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,610
you're hiring they come to these

444
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,950
conferences that - this conferences so

445
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,240
you're in the right spot if you're

446
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,950
looking to get started what about the

447
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,350
people can't make these conferences you

448
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,610
know what about them how do they get the

449
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,650
vibe in so one of the things we did the

450
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,090
Academy is we did a lot of recruiting

451
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,930
from non-traditional sources

452
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,270
pre-screening read resumes blind it's

453
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,790
amazing how different the pool of people

454
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,700
we interview looks when you run through

455
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,500
a bunch of resumes and with no names no

456
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,690
ages honor something and different

457
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,390
people who new interviewing we would

458
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,440
bring in different people different

459
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,690
perspectives some of the Academy teams

460
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,730
some of the best people that we had on

461
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,110
my Academy team for people that I would

462
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,690
I don't hire them and my one of my

463
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,680
people are like no but they're really

464
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,170
good because of this I'm like I guess

465
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,670
I'll take a chance

466
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,680
but I don't see it and then there are

467
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,380
rockstars and I'm like oh man my church

468
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,300
supportive bias isn't working today

469
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,590
I know but so bringing different diverse

470
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,480
people to interview to get a different

471
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,100
perspective so that the likely bias is

472
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,750
cancelled out by having a bunch of

473
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,830
different people who look like the rest

474
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,080
of the world your job and the last thing

475
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,510
is post interviews leaving them good

476
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,010
we've got to do a better job leaving

477
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,530
them good we would interview people when

478
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,970
I say we let me be very clear to be

479
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,730
first jobs as a manager I interview

480
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,070
people I had this great idea I hope you

481
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,710
guys agree with me I thought if I was

482
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,380
really mean in the interview then people

483
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,350
the strong people would stay right and

484
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,600
so I would ask his questions that be

485
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,580
like what support iron if he is on that

486
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,500
I caught 33 I'm like great how does it

487
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,030
transfer the internet power this way

488
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,970
okay great so I'm the fourth bit of that

489
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,230
packet and I keep asking questions and

490
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,360
so they broke and then that was me okay

491
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,920
you lasted about 20 minutes I'll hire

492
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,710
you I thought this was a good idea this

493
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,290
is a terrible idea

494
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,210
stupid I ran into people like five years

495
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,590
later and I felt real bad I was at the

496
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,210
cottage ever and this guy McKay wouldn't

497
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,040
even know who did I talk to you like

498
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,930
five years ago absolutely I go to you

499
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,000
now it's like I'm an accountant I'm like

500
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,830
I'm so sorry what happened he was

501
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,300
laughter you interviewed me I realized I

502
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,030
really didn't belong to leave them good

503
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,710
one of our things that was very proud of

504
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,290
what the Academy program is our post

505
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,940
interview process but was 200 people we

506
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,060
didn't hire we just go can you suck back

507
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,160
we had plucked them into the logo

508
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,750
besides we plugged them into the local

509
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,550
security meetup community we plugged it

510
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,770
into a group called my sec which is a

511
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,660
very broad community across Southeast

512
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,870
Michigan we pointed them in cyber area

513
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,820
another free learning resources we took

514
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,860
hey here's how you scale up here's what

515
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,330
you're missing here's how to do it and

516
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,950
then we invited them back for their use

517
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,810
and often times people won't get it the

518
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,640
first time but two teams later they

519
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,100
would have scaled up and be ready so I

520
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,600
think it's so important we leave people

521
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,880
in a real good space after we interview

522
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,350
them fundamentally this is talking to to

523
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,250
my people again we need to go find the

524
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,500
weird but we need to find better weird

525
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,780
you know I think there's there's this

526
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,010
great thing in order to have the

527
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,840
community but bracing the weird people

528
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,940
and think about the weird people right

529
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,770
only the weed people I know the the

530
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,240
people with the Mohawks the people with

531
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
the flamethrowers the people with the

532
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,620
you know cool clothes that look like

533
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,970
they just got out of bed and we already

534
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,890
conference t-shirt but have like a

535
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,440
blazer over top of it you know all those

536
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,880
sort of things right those doesn't cool

537
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,530
people those are the weird people that

538
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,570
we accept and then someone comes in who

539
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,190
doesn't conform to our idea of

540
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,860
nonconformity you know like oh we can't

541
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,750
deal with you

542
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,880
what I think you know diversity

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,860
inclusion hacker style means going out

544
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,810
and finding new weird weird that does

545
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,550
not conform with our idea weird weird

546
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,680
that does not match where we're at today

547
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,920
weird that can shake things up and flip

548
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,020
over tables much like gen zero did in

549
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,130
the 60s and 70s

550
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:42,060
right so find a weird three okay that's

551
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,690
great but what do we need to do so we

552
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,770
don't have a town shortage they've

553
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,970
already argued we do have a skill

554
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,770
shortage we have a major skill shortage

555
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,240
and before you're like yeah absolutely

556
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,740
we have a skill shortage people that

557
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,640
they don't know how to roll their own

558
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,300
tcp/ip drive time again you're right

559
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,610
damn them or cream cables Noah comes

560
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,320
cables anymore in my day when you wired

561
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,840
uphill both ways

562
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,700
vampire clamps so we have a skill chart

563
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,780
so I'm going to talk in this section

564
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,550
about some of the skills these are not

565
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,220
technical skills I'm sorry you can tweet

566
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,590
at me that I suck its today and besides

567
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,450
Charlotte you have lots of opportunity

568
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,880
to find out the technical skills network

569
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,820
enjoy the sessions know much deeper but

570
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,650
I want to return for just a moment if I

571
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,590
may to our friend and yours Richard

572
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,440
Stallman he this is a picture from his

573
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,670
MIT page he recently was what's the

574
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,500
colloquialism invited to add value

575
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,770
elsewhere

576
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,080
for both MIT and the Free Software

577
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,480
Foundation FSM what happened this month

578
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,400
if you're interested you can read about

579
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,930
it you're not the worry that doesn't

580
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,150
matter here's the point the point is as

581
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,820
those who knew RMS directly and those

582
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,120
who know RMS and Jason Lee go that has a

583
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,540
jerk we all know Leo's a jerk but hey he

584
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,190
did some cool stuff you wrote knew and

585
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,200
he was pushing free software and we

586
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
wanted to stick it to Microsoft back in

587
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,840
the day we all want to stick it to

588
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,550
Microsoft he said that the kids nothing

589
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,570
but Microsoft's cold they did the Xbox

590
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,800
don't you remember Bill Gates the Borg

591
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,180
and they're like who's Bill Gates that

592
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,580
philanthropist yes yes but back in the

593
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,530
day he was the one sticking it to the

594
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,620
man and now he's out and I was gone I

595
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,910
would argue there's two reason for those

596
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,040
two main shifts one is the shift in the

597
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,630
value of skills which I'll cover first

598
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,220
and the next the shift in the

599
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,780
composition of the workplace we're

600
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,940
finding new weird which is fantastic and

601
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,160
we're finding new ways of doing things

602
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
which changes things up you know if you

603
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,240
think about this not necessarily in

604
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,890
terms of Ages but in terms of waves of

605
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,200
technology Jack touched on this is quite

606
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,550
a bit right in the beginning it was

607
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,590
fantastic it was isolated technology

608
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,360
people born the fifties and sixties

609
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,970
entering the workforce faced computers

610
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,620
that were predominantly isolated they

611
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,780
were not necessary networked there was a

612
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,070
lot of work just to get them to talk

613
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,990
there's lots of singing going on and not

614
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,210
lots of producing by the machines we

615
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,800
kept singing to the machines and seeing

616
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,090
them eventually it started to be being

617
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,040
this weird language that sounded like a

618
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,020
robot dying and that's where my people

619
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,350
came in the modems I'm so great and we

620
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,090
began to have this wave of connected

621
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,790
technology right and what changed was

622
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,070
the need to know how to get the

623
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,960
computers necessary to work but now it

624
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,520
became the need to have the computers

625
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,830
talk and communicate and set up stuff in

626
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,440
the web and promote stuff that way

627
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,930
now of course today everything's free of

628
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,670
things cheap people under the workforce

629
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,330
all about ubiquitous technology gen one

630
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,290
gen one our generation needed a great

631
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,930
deal of technical knowledge but we also

632
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,490
need enough social knowledge results and

633
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,110
that connected and we need to sell the

634
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,790
idea of what we're doing to people who

635
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,280
were not technical and sometimes it's

636
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,650
worked very well sometimes intent one

637
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,930
example of this oh my god all right I'm

638
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,630
gonna take out sorry you laugh at me I

639
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,390
was selling a is sold and was

640
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,810
implementing a multi-site VPN in the 90s

641
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,730
and this was a day and age where you

642
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,530
actually had to buy separate pieces of

643
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,420
hardware to do a VPN like here to be

644
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,250
being concentrator here's your IPSec

645
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,290
tunnel here's three pieces of Cisco

646
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,990
hardware to install with a switch it was

647
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,110
a yeah I was whoa what am i doing so we

648
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,520
saw this and I'm building it I'm working

649
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,750
with my team and we're like halfway

650
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,880
through the implementation and I was

651
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,990
managing a team this is when I was

652
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,140
interviewed and terribly so 14 but I'm

653
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,330
making this team and we're in an open

654
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,070
area and they're whiteboarding and I'll

655
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,270
be there whiteboarding the next set

656
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,240
number 28 and then watched the

657
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,160
vice-president know as you walked in but

658
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,420
it elects the vice-president Anthony

659
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,940
he's watching us looking advancing I get

660
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,310
it I get him out and they also turn and

661
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,540
stare at me on their quad and I call

662
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,380
somebody not make sense and the VP goes

663
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,860
did you just say

664
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,340
yes he goes didn't we sell like a

665
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,990
million dollars worth of Cisco equipment

666
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,430
that you've been configuring and doing

667
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,360
VPNs on yes and you don't know

668
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,710
subletting I'm a team know if you type

669
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,090
the numbers in they're the same it seems

670
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:28,750
to work but that was the damage we

671
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,550
walked into you could have a little bit

672
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,380
of technology and a little bit of people

673
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,610
knowledge and make things work and

674
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,710
connected tech now as we give the

675
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,420
ubiquitous attack the problem that we're

676
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,990
facing today with controls as last mile

677
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,300
right the people who are entering the

678
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,850
workforce right today are the people who

679
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,920
will have to like convince DevOps people

680
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,240
that there should be security in their

681
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,890
apps will just convince them to switch

682
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,470
back minims because the developers don't

683
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,760
want to do it because they created

684
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,220
DevOps to avoid us security people that

685
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,410
was the whole idea of people who you can

686
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,820
write code fast you can push the

687
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,460
production and break things with no

688
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,660
security MFA right let's do MFA I'm a

689
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,070
face fantastic it's easy

690
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,870
it'll stop this is evil compromise the

691
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,220
number one way criminals are making

692
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,960
money because ransomware is is it

693
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,060
getting harder I saw the thing in the

694
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,080
Wall Street Journal I read The Wall

695
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,400
Street Journal please don't judge me I

696
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,130
don't actually run nano though so that

697
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:29,650
gives me the point but like 80% of

698
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,360
people we don't do Emma things is too

699
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,100
hard and too cumbersome a lot of these

700
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,460
problems are not technical problems

701
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,510
anymore we all know we should patch

702
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,740
stuff right now we're know we should

703
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,500
patch stuff yeah absolutely do IT guys

704
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,270
want a bad stuff no it's all talking to

705
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,040
other people now and to doing things and

706
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,429
that's gonna wear

707
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:53,279
gen2 is is entering the game and it

708
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,990
takes a lot to be good at things and

709
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,429
there's always that trade-off right the

710
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:57,600
human mind can only do so much

711
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
neuroplasticity is a thing so whatever

712
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,830
you're focusing in on is where you tend

713
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,890
to get good and back in the day you

714
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,090
spend a lot of time with the machines

715
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,620
which meant you didn't spend a lot of

716
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,440
time with people that was me too my my

717
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,720
handle the 90s I don't often times say

718
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,029
this but it's pertinent in the story was

719
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,070
trance those trance if you find the old

720
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,960
BBS well looks not that transfers

721
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,409
another guy because because I would

722
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,740
spend like 12 hours 24 hours 36 hours

723
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,480
staring at the computer programming

724
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,429
trying to get my code to run and my

725
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:30,750
friends would walk in and I'd be like

726
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,010
sleeping under the desk or they'd be

727
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,299
like waving their hand I look out over

728
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,340
the most toad must seem to the regime

729
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,830
alright and so they ended up with that

730
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,950
handle and that was so many of us we got

731
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,350
into this because we had access to the

732
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,330
machines and we had free rein and we

733
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,210
built technical skills that way which

734
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,470
always comes with a cost

735
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,330
so what you're focusing on all right so

736
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,580
that was me then didn't build D in the

737
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,690
center so I'm gonna show you picture I'm

738
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,190
very proud of it okay guys ready I'm not

739
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,380
gonna show you pictures on kids for one

740
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,820
but I'm going to show you this because

741
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,620
this is great this is cabling I did

742
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:15,510
pretty we did an entire data center I

743
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,000
was so proud of this cabling and we had

744
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,649
like racks and racks of this stuff and I

745
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:20,880
could need like every part in this thing

746
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,370
and so today when my generation is

747
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,480
interviewing we're like well tell me

748
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,399
what a fiber channel card is kids are

749
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,909
like cloud and then we get mad right

750
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:33,059
we're like all these and so every you

751
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,350
should take like come to you services

752
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,789
anyone looked at like the county in that

753
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:38,730
plus certain recently it's ridiculous I

754
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,770
was joking about the coax cables but

755
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,390
they literally have a section of coax

756
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,690
cables why are we doing this to people

757
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,159
and it reminds me when I was growing up

758
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,470
and people are like so wolf what are you

759
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,899
gonna get a real job that was about 10

760
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,470
years ago as a family member but early

761
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,909
in the nineties they were like what you

762
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:58,620
need to like work on cars cuz we I was

763
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,690
in Detroit right how do you get a good

764
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,070
job you're not a mechanic you know how

765
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,990
to work on cars that's where all the

766
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,159
jobs are I'm like I don't know how to

767
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,710
work on cars I've never changed my own

768
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,720
my life do you know you can pay $50 and

769
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,460
someone does it for you you sit in your

770
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,299
car suite and they do it for you it's

771
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,860
phenomenal but it was the same thing

772
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,320
right the my parents generation is like

773
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,149
way you don't have any tech skills you

774
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,679
can't change it on a car and now we're

775
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,299
like you don't have any tech skills you

776
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,899
never keep on a data center come on it's

777
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,690
a skills problem so support one is the

778
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,549
skills that we needed to get here I'm

779
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,110
not the skills they need to get there

780
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,630
now it's just some real talk to my

781
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,950
generation we need to remember that

782
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,720
because the skills the moving forward

783
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,130
are changing and we need to have those

784
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,789
conversations ongoing as my academy grew

785
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,070
we would build bigger teams this is a

786
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,490
later team photo some great people here

787
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,350
it is notice that the team sets will

788
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,700
look more like the real world which I

789
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,790
like

790
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,800
make it as awesome ice told her to do

791
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,530
already

792
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,940
gilberto now is one of the lead

793
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,230
engineers at a bank

794
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,770
jordan back here is she's part of a wisp

795
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,540
women and security prodigies that she's

796
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,940
a DEFCON ambassador so for anyone who

797
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,420
wants to go to DEFCON there's

798
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,280
scholarships for four women and she runs

799
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,560
that program great group of people who

800
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,270
taught me a lot of things about what

801
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,610
matters today and one of the things too

802
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,860
that we started notice is we got more

803
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,050
and more people who look different by

804
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,030
doing the things I talked about in terms

805
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,460
of funding and weird and this ended up

806
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,660
being a trying that we see across the

807
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,730
industry right women in InfoSec was like

808
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,290
wow there's a woman in the room that was

809
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,390
like the nineties in the odds and now

810
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,330
we're about 10% on 2010 around this time

811
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,910
I had a team with you go to and I my

812
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,860
team 2020 we're on Raw for 24% so part

813
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,210
of the workforce is where we're headed

814
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,330
and we're pretty close to that

815
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,890
so we're witnessing the shift in real

816
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,460
time this cultural shift that goes along

817
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,710
with these demographics because maybe if

818
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,610
you're the only person in the room

819
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,730
you don't say think about Stallman maybe

820
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,510
if you were a quarter of the workforce

821
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,720
the rest of us go what the hell right

822
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,730
why are we putting up with this why are

823
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,200
we letting our co-workers be treated

824
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,060
like this

825
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,630
and it's not inconsequential one of my

826
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,200
one of my colleagues at dual presented

827
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,170
at blackhat she was at blackhat on some

828
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,660
of our hiring practices at do all I

829
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,550
think it's called like whoa hiring won't

830
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,440
save us or something really good talk

831
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,260
find it on YouTube but rather people and

832
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,880
then 4chan gets involved and then they

833
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,380
douse it with all these terrible

834
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,570
comments about women and securing

835
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,900
everything

836
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,230
now what is going why are we putting up

837
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,770
with this you know and I think we're

838
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,360
seeing the shift where people just don't

839
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,440
need to put up with anymore

840
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,289
and shouldn't and so next one is having

841
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,360
technical skills no longer excuses bad

842
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,370
people skills

843
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,390
RMS could get away with that for a long

844
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,890
time before like yeah but he's fighting

845
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,090
Microsoft he wrote cool code yeah but

846
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,830
he's a terrible human being why would

847
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,720
the number that and I think as we move

848
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,279
forward we need to hold ourselves in our

849
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,000
community to that higher standard that

850
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,419
was heavy let's get back to hacking

851
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,909
hacker diction definition right emphasis

852
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:29,610
mind it's moving from program to solving

853
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,390
problems the guy in the hoodie both

854
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,610
problems being more people hacking I

855
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,770
love the social engineering I've opted

856
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,450
to become social Jerry targets on my

857
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,399
badge I love those things those

858
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,049
challenges are fantastic so take

859
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,690
advantage of what skills do people need

860
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,730
that amass all the time a lot of us good

861
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,230
people skills self awareness self

862
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,860
management being able to have of good

863
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,140
relationships and then the meta skills

864
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,510
is really where you it is this is where

865
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,760
the money is people no one knows yeah

866
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,380
and you have a great career if you're

867
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,049
good at study but you will write this is

868
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:06,029
a menace kill the tech is always

869
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:07,890
changing there's this great art called a

870
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,119
few years ago the buck dead and dying

871
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,070
technology when I wonder what's dead and

872
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,629
dying I open it up I'm like oh my god I

873
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:15,379
made my money

874
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,940
yes sorry sorry trigger warning I

875
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,599
on the trigger warning that way that me

876
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,300
when I was when I was in the early

877
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,899
aughts I won this contract to build this

878
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,668
web user interface it was pretty cool

879
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:41,050
it's pretty slick at the time today it's

880
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,270
like ya young but that deal was we put a

881
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,429
web interface in front of everything we

882
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,659
had this web interface to get back from

883
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,609
the mainframe we had all our Web Apps

884
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:50,800
through it it was basically a launcher

885
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,079
and a portal and one and I wasn't

886
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:55,540
contract on a guess but I don't know

887
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,430
what I'm doing I had no idea I'd like no

888
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,829
idea I was using a text editor and

889
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,380
running the code and I get a server 500

890
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,540
I'm like well that didn't work reading

891
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,730
my code or we do it again and so I'm

892
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,260
like this I don't feel good about this

893
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,599
so I went went to the key stakeholder

894
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,059
the project right before you say can we

895
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:15,579
talk those of the doors again what's in

896
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,980
your mind wolf I said I don't know what

897
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,190
I'm doing and he looked at me for a long

898
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:31,270
moment ago stage do you want to hire me

899
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,369
for this project cause I could hire a

900
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:34,930
developer an engineer like you should

901
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,059
and right then I should have had that

902
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:39,190
ear for dev ops that I had had it then I

903
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,270
would have been a lot of money but I

904
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,040
didn't but you should though those guys

905
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,900
would know they're doing I don't like

906
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,069
yeah but you know other thing so like

907
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,420
what because well you know the team in

908
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,640
both good relationships you know how to

909
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,349
learn whatever I throw it you can figure

910
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,599
out is it I'm not paying you to know I'm

911
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,760
paying you to learn and implement I pay

912
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,859
you to solve problems and a light bulb

913
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:59,589
went on over my head I'm like great cuz

914
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:00,910
that don't more authentic right I don't

915
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,200
have to think that I know what I'm doing

916
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,119
when I don't how we're on the same page

917
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,880
when yes I'm selling you my ability to

918
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,840
study because whenever my

919
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,670
so how do you do this how do you move

920
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,470
people forward this is a coaching

921
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,060
framework that I thought in my academy

922
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,609
program it is blissfully stolen from the

923
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:22,430
first 90 days we talk about people on

924
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,869
four different dimensions we coach them

925
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:26,210
about how to manage their perceptions we

926
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,230
coach them about how to build

927
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,300
relationships with coach them about how

928
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,800
to build competencies I think those

929
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,140
three areas are the key skills moving

930
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,510
forward for this next gen coming into

931
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,220
our security and then you bring all this

932
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,359
together you do stuff that actually

933
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:39,980
matters all right what are the wins what

934
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,240
does your employer care about most the

935
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,350
community care about whatever it may be

936
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,210
I don't know what that is you got to

937
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,530
figure that out yourself you have

938
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,320
relationships for that this breaks down

939
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,609
into two different ways you can think

940
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:51,170
about in terms of people skills and

941
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,580
technical skills you want the hard and

942
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,650
soft skills I always like that what's

943
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,290
harder and harder soft skills soft

944
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,990
skills but we'll call it that way it's

945
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,290
okay

946
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,760
all right and it's not like you can't

947
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,040
not know the machine right so you guys

948
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,210
are still probably wondering what are

949
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,640
the rights technical skills to learn

950
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,540
that's a talking of itself please enjoy

951
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,369
beside Charlotte and get that

952
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:18,710
information out when you find out let me

953
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,050
know because that's not what this is

954
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,850
about this is about having a good career

955
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,500
and this is about moving your ball

956
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,690
forward all right for when having a good

957
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,070
career in being a hacker what does that

958
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,540
mean what's different between me an

959
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,150
accountant and a hacker

960
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,460
different than being a clerical worker

961
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,410
in a hacker I'd say one of the main

962
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,020
things as we break stuff right no Hector

963
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,940
ever succeeded by embracing the status

964
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,589
quo of accepting things as they are we

965
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:46,809
don't color in the lines and you think

966
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,250
about it there's a good reason for that

967
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,500
gen zero right 1960s my generation the

968
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,690
1990s counterculture I mean we had

969
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,250
nirvana probably doesn't compare it to

970
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,109
Jimi Hendrix you can make some area

971
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,329
nevermind but you see my point right I

972
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,140
mean we grew up sticking it to the man

973
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,450
we grew up with that rebel status in our

974
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,859
community and we really need to preserve

975
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:11,680
it so thinking about this in the day of

976
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,539
my wife is with me we're at a was it the

977
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:19,329

995
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,080
bunch of middle aged people to my

996
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,520
people to my right out of the suit

999
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,570
to let them stick it to the man how do

1000
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,710
we make sure that we can continue and

1001
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,420
being the rebel status when the people

1002
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,640
don't report to us that's not easy

1003
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,970
that's not easy you know go go break

1004
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,620
something go break a rule don't listen

1005
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,360
to what I say go stick to the banks I'm

1006
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,650
the man

1007
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,630
and honestly you'll be fine right I'm

1008
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,150
just writing myself for a chair so it's

1009
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,730
so important that we set up systems so

1010
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,040
that we can allow our younger folks

1011
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,050
coming in to stick it to the man because

1012
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,360
the rebelliousness is such an integral

1013
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,090
part of our computing of our industry

1014
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,860
and that rebelliousness is what pushes

1015
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,590
the envelope forward is what will get us

1016
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,500
where we need to go the second part of

1017
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,450
that and including sickening to the man

1018
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,610
Keys skill breaking rules never likes to

1019
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,250
break rules here right can't break a

1020
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,130
couple rules there's an art to breaking

1021
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,320
rules I actually have rules on breaking

1022
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,480
rules I will share with you a few

1023
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,240
number one break a rule every day it

1024
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,030
keeps you fresh break something there's

1025
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,619
something that people are asking you to

1026
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,280
do that we relation to next what getting

1027
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,540
that in troubles of muscle you got to

1028
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,609
exercise that muscle right get yourself

1029
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:37,609
into trouble and get out of it with a

1030
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,690
smile with panache for hackers come on

1031
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,490
I'll never break a rule which you cannot

1032
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,010
accept the consequences of breaking this

1033
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,810
is an important one if you can't afford

1034
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,829
the speeding ticket

1035
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:52,490
don't try 125 miles an hour if I can do

1036
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,200
it and talk yourself out of that ticket

1037
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,760
and then let us know because that's an

1038
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,010
awesome story so be accountable never

1039
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,140
break a rule where someone else pays

1040
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,300
actually had to add this one break every

1041
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,010
day and then I can't we broke a rule

1042
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,599
mcawesome would you do yeah we walked

1043
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,619
out on our restaurant though like you

1044
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:14,630
realize that the waitstaff has to pay

1045
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,109
with their tips for that right oh yeah

1046
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,480
don't break a rule where someone else

1047
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,040
has to become a week we need to be

1048
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,200
gentle in the world and how we go about

1049
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,140
this and finally my favorite is people

1050
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,220
tell them when you're gonna break the

1051
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,470
rule especially good when you got a

1052
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,000
manager who encourages you to stick it

1053
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,160
to the man oh by the way I'm breaking

1054
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,089
their rule we were at at a speaker

1055
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:40,010
dinner last night and one of the

1056
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,420
organizers of the speaker dinner comes

1057
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,550
up to me that organizes this event but

1058
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,560
organizers of the big pipes and she's

1059
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,230
like here's the rules in this that time

1060
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,569
should you do this I don't know she goes

1061
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:54,040
what I know I'm gonna break one of these

1062
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,910
okay and then I got a word for at the

1063
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,980
end of the day so it all worked out all

1064
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,170

don't have Woodstock right but we've got

1066
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,480
a tidal wave of things that I think have

1067
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,350
formed the background of this generation

1068
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,800
Harry Potter right Hunger Games Marvel

1069
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,440

1070
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,450

00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,260
with Excel

1093
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,969
I actually do love Excel quick sidenote

1094
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:22,640
so I was like I would bury it so if it

1095
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,769
could make me coffee and like by the end

1096
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,089
of that meeting I'm like here's how you

1097
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:37,269
can have Excel chapter 5

1098
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:40,009

1100
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:43,430
you're feeling like on the inside right

1101
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,319

1102
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:48,799
syndrome one if you're not the impostor

1103
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:50,900
syndrome don't feel like an imposter

1104
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,099
because you're not telling impostor

1105
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,809
syndrome that's a little bit circular

1106
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:56,749
right don't do that second thing is we

1107
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:58,189
all feel that way and I think I also

1108
00:43:58,189 --> 00:44:01,130
you've come to home imposter syndrome as

1109
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,119
a engine light or as a sign that under

1110
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:05,839
the right direction

1111
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,489
right because if I feel that way like I

1112
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,859
am at the right room you all are better

1113
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:11,739
than me and I don't belong here

1114
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:16,160
perfect that's to it so first the good

1115
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,759
news for the heroes in the room we are

1116
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:22,910
well compensated which is fantastic the

1117
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,939
starting salary in the state of 63,000

1118
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:27,439
for information security professionals

1119
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:32,390
the median income is 60,000 state after

1120
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,890
state when I do a similar talk and I

1121
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,170
pull the numbers it's always this way

1122
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,339
information security isn't that weird we

1123
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:38,869
start right out of college and we're

1124
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:40,969
making more than most people in the

1125
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,640
state strange to think of strange to

1126
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,829
think of so that's the good news we're

1127
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:47,150
off to a good start we got a good life

1128
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,309
going on we have some responsibilities

1129
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:54,289
with that obviously now the bad news we

1130
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:56,929
are effectively elite athletes mentally

1131
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,880
this is what we do

1132
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,359
maybe not badly

1133
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,890
that's how I feel all right yeah think

1134
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:14,180
so that's how I wish there's my so my

1135
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,140
point is this though I point is this I

1136
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,839
will say work-life balance one time in

1137
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:22,400
this talk and to say that I'm not saying

1138
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,650
work-life balance in this talk in this

1139
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,869
community in this industry a lot of us

1140
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:29,150
to excel it it it becomes our lives this

1141
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,880
is what we do we travel like athletes

1142
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,039
some of us spend way too much time in

1143
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,170
airports we're constantly training

1144
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,849
constantly study we're constantly aware

1145
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:40,190
that if we slow down that we can fall

1146
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,630
behind once you fall behind it's very

1147
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,779
hard to catch back up again it is

1148
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:47,660
constant running constant motion and and

1149
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,640
it's stressful right we need to handle

1150
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,900
that stress so good rule is embrace

1151
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,519
de-stress get comfortable being

1152
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,089
uncomfortable I would start my Academy

1153
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,700
interviews days and congratulations have

1154
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,680
you guys watched the 18 I did that for

1155
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,329
two teams and I realize no one watch the

1156
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:11,089
18 but it really is like that I'm like

1157
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:13,279
I'm gonna give you a paper clip I'm

1158
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:15,619
gonna give you a roll of duct tape I'm

1159
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:17,119
gonna give you some gunpowder I'm gonna

1160
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,619
give you half the money you need in a

1161
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:20,599
quarter of the time you need and we're

1162
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:23,569
gonna do something awesome and some of

1163
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:24,980
my team would be like that's great that

1164
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,170
stresses me out but that's awesome and

1165
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,880
otherwise my team if you talk to some of

1166
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,230
the people I'm I can't be like oh my god

1167
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,450
I don't ever want to work for wolf again

1168
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:37,789
like yes but we did it didn't we that's

1169
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:39,410
not the point so you gotta become

1170
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,970
comfortable being uncomfortable you know

1171
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,489
that there's this this great analogy

1172
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:46,460
with trees and bottom to about those two

1173
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,109
persons that the big dome that was built

1174
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:50,029
that everyone was using to figure out

1175
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:51,950
can we get to Mars and they planted a

1176
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,960
whole bunch of trees right so they all

1177
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,549
these trees in the dome and the trees

1178
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:57,100
keep falling over people

1179
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,240
history's following where there's

1180
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,100
nothing going on and start looking at it

1181
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,170
what ended up being was because there's

1182
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,730
no wind down the tree because there's no

1183
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,260
stress in the tree the tree grew no

1184
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,510
roots and therefore the slightest thing

1185
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,270
would not get over insecurity we've got

1186
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,520
to be able to have deep roots and those

1187
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,170
deep roots are in community and we have

1188
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,640
to be able to handle the stress that

1189
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,580
comes with this job

1190
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,140
now burnouts real burnouts real don't

1191
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,850
get me wrong this is how about I was

1192
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,430
think about burnout I was so good but

1193
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,340
now I'm burnt and broken and that does

1194
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,600
happen to people don't get me wrong I'm

1195
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,550
not downplaying that but I would argue

1196
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,350
that a better analogy for burnout to

1197
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,840
something like this which is I feel

1198
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,820
great and then I'm dead

1199
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,220
and this segment could be through a day

1200
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,890
this cycle my personal way is about six

1201
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,960
weeks first couple weeks up my man I

1202
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,580
would do anything I'm talk to my boss I

1203
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,690
will write that white paper and I will

1204
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,460
give four talks by the way I sent up for

1205
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,130
for talks in three weeks all different

1206
00:47:51,130 --> 00:48:02,740
talks all different slide decks but

1207
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,880
we're used to this though we're used to

1208
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,140
so right we're used to running down

1209
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,910
batteries recharging things and I think

1210
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,140
this is a good metaphor because there's

1211
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,220
two different things you need one you

1212
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,500
need good power management and two you

1213
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,600
need things that do your recharging so

1214
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,210
here's some tips for both for power

1215
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,890
management stress management toolbox

1216
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,050
have a toolbox have a way of planning

1217
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,930
your schedule that includes things that

1218
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,090
will preserve your sanity because you

1219
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,490
will need it food to sleep obviously I

1220
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,650
love my massages that's one of my

1221
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,720
favorite ones I'd a massage right before

1222
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,630
coming out here because again at the

1223
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,240
moment so I had this massage that's

1224
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,100
about my masseuse and she's like what

1225
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,870
did you do to your back how much you

1226
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,250
don't want to know how many talks us I

1227
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,680
know four

1228
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,410
you are crazy Midland I know they get

1229
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,380
like an extra half-hour so massage is

1230
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,820
taking time off right we need to take

1231
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,440
our time I don't know why this industry

1232
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,480
is like we don't take our time off ha I

1233
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,010
am man I do not need rest again have you

1234
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:03,750
have you did your self reason you know

1235
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,970
there is like a world outside this data

1236
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:09,720
center so taking the kitchens

1237
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,910
so there's having planned points

1238
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,680
throughout your week throughout your

1239
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,970
month to bounce and recharge and then on

1240
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,920
what charges you up right could be

1241
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,330
sports could be exercise I'm loving the

1242
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,590
gym that always turns me on could be

1243
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,750
music I love getting off planes with the

1244
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,670

1245
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,910
song going on no one knows it they're

1246
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,680
like what is this weird guy doing power

1247
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,770
walking he is not Tom Cruise I am Tom

1248
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,790

1249
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,490
I am ready Walker it off I hit the lift

1250

I do my meetings life is good hacker

1251
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,120
conference is another one I always

1252
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,950
whenever I'm at these conferences always

1253
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:44,910
come back with a whole bunch of ideas

1254
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,980
not much of excitement so know what

1255
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,570
charges you up and plan those things out

1256
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,610
within your week so that you got a

1257
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,930
variety of different things that are

1258
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,580
pushing you forward and preserving your

1259
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,740
energy that's how to handle the stress

1260
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,110
but it's also important to know to

1261
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,540
handle the stop right short term stress

1262
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,580
awesome focuses you makes you more

1263
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,490
creative gives you ideas allows you to

1264
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,160
do the impossible long term stress

1265
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,510
terrible takes away your creativity

1266
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,070
takes away your ability to sing to the

1267
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,670
Machine so know the difference

1268
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,820
there are indicator lights for this I'll

1269
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,350
give you some of my favorite ones and

1270
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,590
some advice on what to do physiological

1271
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,930
effects we can't sleep if you're getting

1272
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,110
weight all sort of things maybe do some

1273
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,250
the balanced active as I mentioned

1274
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,280
earlier or gtfo

1275
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,079
gtfo will be a recurring thing about

1276
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,660
not competitive compensation why the

1277
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,989
heck would we take non-competitive

1278
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:43,789
conversation don't do it folks come to

1279
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:47,509
it in of any industry that should have

1280
00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:50,239
equal compensation for people regardless

1281
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,180
of gender or ethnicity it shouldn't be

1282
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,069
ours I mean we're the ones who sing to

1283
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:56,749
the Machine you can sink the machine if

1284
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:58,220
we sink the machine equal you should be

1285
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,210
paid equally if not we need to GTFO lack

1286
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,460
of training athletes for not training

1287
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,630
we're not maintaining we're gonna fall

1288
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,349
behind so big-time talk to your boss

1289
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:11,119
career path if there's not one level up

1290
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,710
get out or gtfo poor teamwork is another

1291
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,359
one there's all sorts of ways it can be

1292
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,849
better teammates I think we should but

1293
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,680
at the end of the day the human being is

1294
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,109
a fantastic pack animal we are a great

1295
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:27,950
caveman seeing the Machine and as a pack

1296
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,809
animal the caveman our strength has

1297
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:32,119
always been each other right the people

1298
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:34,039
in the room that bring down the woolly

1299
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:35,509
mammoth in the data center I think that

1300
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,210
now just got weird but you know what I'm

1301
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,410
saying so if the team sucks get out if

1302
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,700
your leadership sucks

1303
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,329
get it out nothing defines your

1304
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:49,249
experience of the company more or less

1305
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:51,920
than its leader section one the reasons

1306
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,400
why I left many jobs if they don't

1307
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,960
appreciate you or recognize you maybe

1308
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,480
you've got expectations set wrong maybe

1309
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,829
to understand your job or maybe they

1310
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:02,210
don't understand what you're doing so

1311
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,670
try and fix that if not gtfo misaligned

1312
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,769
values and culture I don't know how to

1313
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:11,690
go and do this one if you're sitting

1314
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,549
there going how man if you slimy what I

1315
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:14,559
do my job

1316
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,739
gtfo right we are the average of the

1317
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,070
people that we

1318
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,720
and we're the average of the things we

1319
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,030
do and if we're not in a good spot we

1320
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,070
need to get out and don't tape over

1321
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,710
these lights either I think because

1322
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,000
there's such a lack of talent in the

1323
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,550
perception of lack of talent right now

1324
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,890
by hanging out what any of these things

1325
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,930
are wrong we're actually not only

1326
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,130
hurting ourselves or hurting our

1327
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,360
industry because we're teaching

1328
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,370
companies that they can treat us a

1329
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,230
certain way and get away with it to get

1330
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,150
out they stay in close ok I can lower my

1331
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,890
salary and whatever values I can those

1332
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,600
are things so reading the situations

1333
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,310
it's not right don't tip over the

1334
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,240
indicator lights

1335
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,170
gtfo now more about GT FL quitting

1336
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,640
compete scoping when it frees you up to

1337
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,520
excel something fits you that is awesome

1338
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,530
I'm not encouraging able to coisa quit

1339
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,760
the job though you need to know is this

1340
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,500
short term stress or long term stress

1341
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,110
long term stressors absolutely do

1342
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,600
something about short term stressors

1343
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,220
don't quit over look back to some of the

1344
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,510
things I was talking about stress relief

1345
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,580
because short term stressors will come

1346
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,350
and go well I'll have a bad quarter Oh a

1347
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:23,040
bad couple of months there was a time a

1348
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,360
couple years ago where every single

1349
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,890
windows coming home to my wife I'm like

1350
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,590
I made it I just need to make it to the

1351
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,970
next week she goes do you know how long

1352
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,890
you've been saying that so don't tell me

1353
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,180
six eight week project and we crushed it

1354
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,220
and then we moved on knowing when to

1355
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,870
stay in when to go is really what

1356
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,580
ultimately will help us become those

1357
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,110
elite athletes those elite mental

1358
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,230
athletes that we need to be alright

1359
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,970
in conclusion I still got time right now

1360
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,950
I kind of do it kind of time I would

1361
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,720
tell you the story about how I got into

1362
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,200
ITT

1363
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,750
this is my first computer that I own

1364
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,980
thank you it was a beautiful machine and

1365
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,320
I sang to it it booted right into basic

1366
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,330
which meant anything I want to do it a

1367
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,550
program and did not have the ideal

1368
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,370
sprites yet so I would take an ASCII map

1369
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,110
and do all my animations by be messing

1370
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,810
around the pasty maps

1371
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,990
but fun and this this was maybe when I

1372
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,640
was like 9 or 10 and I want to be hacker

1373
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,950
right so as I became a teenager I got on

1374
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,390
the DSS I want to be a hacker

1375
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,460
what do you do to you know prove

1376
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,020
yourself as a hacker I'd watched

1377
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,470
wargames and sneakers and watch Tron I

1378
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,330
assume there's something to do with the

1379
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,950
lifecycle and everything

1380
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,810
find out how to be happy with the lights

1381
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,550
but it won't be like you need to you

1382
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:45,180
need to be route horse's head and so so

1383
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,120
a few years ago by I end up being at a

1384
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,010
hospital we're kind of Hospital about 17

1385
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,350
I got in this basically like in the

1386
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,210
support staff role my girlfriend was

1387
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,440
there so I figured I worked there too

1388
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,420
thought their passions people to follow

1389
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,510
your passions and I was spending a lot

1390
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,610
of time with the nurses because teenage

1391
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,400
boy and we were we were at the time

1392
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,400
building a network it was very modern

1393
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,020
with Windows 3x net we're 3 1 2 and it

1394
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,910
didn't actually have cat cables so at

1395
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,340
least we had Ethernet it was good and it

1396
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,110
was hard he kept breaking we and I would

1397
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,579
help out as I could and we finally

1398
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:22,349
we finally got online the nurse was in

1399
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:23,849
charge that project she quit she was out

1400
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:26,429
she's done she didn't want to be and I

1401
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,660
teach you what I mean healthcare she's

1402
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,079
done

1403
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,999
so Director of Nursing calls me down to

1404
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:33,869
her office and she was so incredible

1405
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:36,269
when she's five foot two in her 50s

1406
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:39,390
Texas woman who everyone was terrified

1407
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,019
of she was awesome so I'm I'm in her

1408
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:44,519
office I'm sure I'm getting in trouble

1409
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:46,709

1415
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:03,150
you guys know that time when you say

1416
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,769
something you really want to get back

1417
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,439
okay because the room temperature fell

1418
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:10,890
10 degrees folks there was a tin whistle

1419
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,709
and tumbleweed in the background and I

1420
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:17,309
was sure I was gonna get shot so when I

1421
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:20,009
was on these BBS's BBS culture was a

1422
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,739
whole other thing and you would often

1423
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,239
time to get in and ask things and they

1424
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,829
tell you that you're stupid and you keep

1425
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:27,809
asking into the gun answer let me change

1426
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:28,410

cuz now you're the smart guy oh those

1428
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:32,819

gross is there a better way well you can

1432
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:40,739
call people and what I did I would get

1433
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:45,599
the passwords you only talk to them like

1434
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,410
verbally that's fun and they write code

1435
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,569
to exploit all of those I'm a yes I can

1436
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:52,799

00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:02,099
Nursing is staring at me I'm staring at

1441
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,289

1442
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:06,599
long pregnant pause she goes what is

1443
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:07,670
your condition

1444
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:10,240

1445
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,500
she looked at me she goes deal about

1446
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,420

1448
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,800
for it and that was how I started my

1449
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,070
career is a blue TV fender right at a

1450
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,960
hospital protecting things I want to ask

1451
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,640
you guys today can you imagine any

1452
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,250
Hospital in America

1453
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,640
that would hire a 17 year old kid just

1454
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,220
out of high school and say sure have

1455
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,210
recess admin health records are over

1456
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:55,700
there kids these days and my debut just

1457
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,560
showed up we don't even need calories a

1458
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,330
lot of people my generation oncology is

1459
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:00,650
you know why because we showed up they

1460
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,180
went you know how to sing more like we

1461
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,390
do you've got a job it was great I'm

1462
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:09,770
sorry but that's how I got in that's

1463
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:10,940
what I say it's no longer legal because

1464
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,500
the way I got in and the way a lot of

1465
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,390
our generation got in doesn't quite work

1466
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,610
anymore another definition of hacking I

1467
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,990
like is hacking is understanding the

1468
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,820
system better than it understands itself

1469
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,780
and nudging into do what you want

1470
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,590
the system was IT right back in the day

1471
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:29,210
or the telephone system you want to go

1472
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,460
back to the 60s it was IT it was in

1473
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,300
isolation but today IT is the backbone

1474
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,650
of everything the backbone of our

1475
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,370
government the backbone of is everything

1476
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,810
about our government I got discouraged

1477
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,080
the big government of our businesses of

1478
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,610
our life its backbone of everything and

1479
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,010
what that means is our system is this

1480
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,500
really interesting closed loop between

1481
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,140
the technology and the people and so

1482
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,030
moving forward we can't just limit

1483
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,130
ourselves to happy

1484
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,340
equipment we have to nudge both people

1485
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,030
and the machine so key points to my

1486
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,280
generation and those before me who are

1487
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,220
currently the employers and the man

1488
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,830
unfortunately we need to open new roles

1489
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,410
for InfoSec we need to go beyond what

1490
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,900
looks like us what's come before we need

1491
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,730
to find those people bring them in we

1492
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,440
need to use our positions are very

1493
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,600
fortunate position we this really cool

1494
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,180
weird bubble that suddenly computers are

1495
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,620
perdón people know how to do it and we

1496
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,720
got jobs we need to use those positions

1497
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,880
we got from there to protect those who

1498
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,500
are coming in and drive things forward

1499
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,720
we just share more than technical skills

1500
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,940
we need to share life skills and how to

1501
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,590
build a career over the longer term

1502
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,110
because every tech skill we have is dead

1503
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,150
or dying and I don't necessarily mean me

1504
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,520
and I mean every skill we all have is

1505
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,900
that are dying that's the beauty of

1506
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,810
technology and changes every few years

1507
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,190
and we need to build the people coming

1508
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,560
up as the heroes they are we need to be

1509
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,480
the Nick Fury we want to see in the

1510
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,630
world

1511
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:04,140
all right to the avocados in the room

1512
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,430
don't be a jerk just because they're not

1513
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:10,000
enough econo people come on fine new

1514
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,460
weird find people not like you don't let

1515
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,240
hacking become just a job this is this

1516
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,250
really weird thing that we all do that

1517
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,410
we hang on conferences and we hang on

1518
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,300
bars when you're departing to travel

1519
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,550
preserve that preserve that as long as

1520
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,550
we can this is a limited-time bubble and

1521
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,770
I don't know how I'm gonna run run it

1522
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,230
hard to run a bomb

1523
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,850
remember that systems are social and

1524
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,550
tactical we need to hack both and for

1525
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:41,040
God's sakes people flip over some tables

1526
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,569
[Music]

1527
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,320
we are reaching reaching in six years of

1528
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,930
have you dated from that first mention

1529
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:56,430
that I might teach six years of hacking

1530
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:00,030
right I want to hit it hard I want to

1531
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,430
hit it with things that we haven't seen

1532
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,550
before so we have someone you do to

1533
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,860
amplify so we need to create I want to

1534
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,320
hit the six-year anniversary with the

1535
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,110
degree of humility and curiosity I want

1536
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:16,320
to hit that degree with cooperation I

1537
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,560
want to hit it hard preserving a rebel

1538
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,600
status and preserving our ability to

1539
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,360
sing to the machines I want to continue

1540
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,140
breaking some rules but I want to see us

1541
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,950
build some people

1542
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,280
and that's it thank you much guys
