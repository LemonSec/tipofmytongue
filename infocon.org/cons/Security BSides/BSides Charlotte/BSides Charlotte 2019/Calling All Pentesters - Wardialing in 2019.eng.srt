1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,769
I know and I'm Sophia today

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,570
this is coronal Panthers - war Dolan in

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,720
2019 and since is years besides phim it

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,900
is quite the journeys into in Passaic

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,400
before I try and incorporate a little

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,650
bit of my journey pip into the

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,650
presentations so that we could hear

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,800
about that story Tamar said I have to

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,539
use my phone because my computer's not

10
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,000
cooperating for slightly - excuse me if

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,460
I'm not looking down all the time yeah

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,620
if you rip my body minor from Brampton

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,089
but not originally from here though

14
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:44,949
Brittany from England I went to high

15
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,720
school of the equivalent of high school

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,830
primary school over there

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,619
and finished there and there was this

18
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,500
all the time whereas finishing up with

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,659
my Jam's you get kind of two weeks of

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,119
school or a couple months to do your

21
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,640
exams where my parents allegedly moved

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,170
so I was living there on my own with my

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,319
sister and my uncle and it was a really

24
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,880
awkward time because everybody was kind

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,020
of growing up getting ready to go to

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,210
college so I decided that I'm going to

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,580
mess around on the Internet all right so

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,520
that's that's really did I eventually

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,820
time came and moved over

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,850
and there was a number over time because

31
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,700
being an out-of-state College is very

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,190
expensive and we didn't have a whole lot

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,460
of money

34
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,690
we have been nine years gonna go to

35
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,920
community college so it's originally

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,880
actually gonna go and be a carpenter I

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,440
found out real quick that I didn't want

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,670
to do that once to get here and it's

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,440
very hot and carpet draining you know

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,760
there's a little bit different than it

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,530
is here here it's back in there wasn't

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,900
two-by-fours of making houses over there

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,210
it's more of a skilled like cabinetry

44
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,040
and stuff so for what am I going to do

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,790
maybe it can be an electrician quickly

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,200
found out that I could not be an

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,700
electrician because I'm not very good at

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,119
math same as a realtor and it's a very

49
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,100
electrical engineering just didn't do it

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,110
you know I spend a lot of time in

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,210
computers maybe I can get a job I've

52
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,000
done some AOL stuff like changing the

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,280
colors of my profile that kind of thing

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
makes misplacing webpages I'm gonna see

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,970
if maybe a good job doing computer

56
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,440
programming so I'll go for computer

57
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,880
program it wasn't really the same

58
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,060
programs at Community College back then

59
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,310
around the 2000s as there is now now you

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,650
can you can do some type of security

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,060
right out community colleges is pretty

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,640
awesome so I chose even computer science

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,570
programming or I forget the oval but I

64
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,280
chose programming to the full you know

65
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,870
that's really cool

66
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,490
they came around the road this man and

67
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,190
the aroma room pretty much enroll me in

68
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,750
all of his classes he was a Vietnam

69
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,170
veteran still friends of him to this day

70
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,130
dearly

71
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,380
they helped me out and got me a job in

72
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,930
the college and everything so that was

73
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,480
that was pretty cool on my appearance

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,360
the first week was said I was surrounded

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,380
by record of locals at the table because

76
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,700
I couldn't leave I couldn't technically

77
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,590
drive because I wasn't 18 yeah and I

78
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,870
didn't have my GED so I couldn't leave

79
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,370
college I get dropped off in the morning

80
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,730
we picked up whenever just like school I

81
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,560
was hearing by locals and they're all

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,060
kind of harassing me like you look from

83
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,620
around here where are you from and this

84
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,380
guy came and rescued me pulled me out of

85
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,050
the room or the room was outside but he

86
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,430
pulled me out off to the side and said

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,850
hey what's up what he did and we became

88
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,200
really good friends he'd drive me around

89
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,060
with party as much as he could and yeah

90
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,650
he he was an English major and he

91
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,570
introduced me to the library didn't

92
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,360
write him he introduced me to 2600 I

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,130
didn't understand any of this maybe you

94
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,600
do business super cool let's go to a

95
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,019
meeting so we went to I went to my first

96
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,070
2600 meeting right before the first

97
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,200
carolina club and they

98
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,109
what's the word they were very

99
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,750
enthusiastic about me presenting and

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,200
they pretty much talked me into a know

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,359
if it was me or them all those talked me

102
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,790
into presenting us and that was a

103
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,510
mistake for ya so that's pretty much

104
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,769
what happened with that and I did intend

105
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,180
to supply it but my first presentation

106
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,440
was pretty old voice on water and since

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,509
then I've been trying to improve my

108
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:31,410
presentation skills and kind of share

109
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,080
the knowledge whose people's there

110
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,419
that's the presentations I've done first

111
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,630
was in 2005 2010 I did done a lot of

112
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,849
Carolina content presented at Derby and

113
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,729
most recently difficult and the OS

114
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,080
charts on there because we're trying to

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,669
stop back up so if any of you are

116
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,849
interested web stuff huh next month so

117
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:56,370
that's just coming out so who here has a

118
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,680
telephone right I think I guess we don't

119
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
need to do raised hands everybody has a

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,180
telephone or who has telephony connected

121
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,500
devices zero know what Waldo Nia's I

122
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,940
mean it's pretty pretty straightforward

123
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,389
right

124
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,680
you can't really talk about it without

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,389
doing the classic clip let's see if it

126
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,400
plays this mouse is backwards where are

127
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,029
you

128
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:26,439
don't left help right go down there we

129
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,259
go so we're gonna have to try to play

130
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,529
this

131
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,580
you got there like that

132
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,440
well basically he's asking for the

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,539
prefixes per divisionist from the

134
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:48,520
marriages and I guess that's all about

135
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,229
social engineer right there he's doing

136
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,190
strike in the numbers

137
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,830
this is all old stuff raised you know

138
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,070
floppies and everything so you really

139
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,390
can't talk about watering without

140
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,980
sharing a clip from this movie connected

141
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,820
it's going on

142
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,340
this is protégés not happy now are these

143
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,850
thoughts darling now I'm going to get

144
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,790
back to the slides

145
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,660
so this is you know just be dealing with

146
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,550
we go up Commodore 64 software a haze

147
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,360
modem scanner and it basically

148
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,180
sequentially dial through a number

149
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,090
prefix in and it would go down one by

150
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,690
one very manual you have to babysit

151
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:42,320
those very basic so you get into and I

152
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,200
think this was 1984 copyright I'm sure

153
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,520
here it went through the trouble get a

154
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,720
copyright our gym where these war those

155
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,720
there's Commodore 64 and they can tell

156
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,050
the graphics again way better in these

157
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,020
let's see the next one I think is I mean

158
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,730
look at those graphics written by

159
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,340
riffraff in the Borgata this is the

160
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,380
description right of the web so as far

161
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,120
as hackers and orders go this one's a

162
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,440
pretty nice one so let's see well that

163
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,960
we have links now we get into more

164
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,970
modern more darling with that THC scan

165
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,000
the hackers choice das based you can

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
probably still download this and run

167
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,650
this today if you really wanted to I

168
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,660
don't see why you would there there's

169
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,430
commercial dollars this one still sold

170
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,200
to this day arm is very expensive I

171
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,950
think that

172
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,930
if you wanna die or 16 lines is about

173
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,480
$20,000 plus you need 16 items to go

174
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,750
with it plus phone lines that's owned by

175
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,290
Nixon they actually bought sandstorm

176
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,120
which helped the patent owners so they

177
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,830
still there I have not used this

178
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,460
software is very expensive but you can

179
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,830
tell from the algorithm system

180
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,330
requirements is pretty old a minute or

181
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,740
until entropy and the latest of

182
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,540
operating systems - any time I walk room

183
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,940
by the Beave front of had no telephone

184
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,920
believe it was to be able J Falcon

185
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,440
worked a lot miss to this one we get

186
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,110
more into modern war darling with white

187
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,010
blinds so this uses I accept all kind of

188
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,870
tactile things this one's you know we're

189
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,180
getting up there with this was released

190
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,420
about the same time that's war vote

191
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,890
which is probably the one everybody's

192
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,000
most familiar if you talk war dining now

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,510
HD more release this believe ten years

194
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,690
ago someone that uses is to which is

195
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,330
very similar to sit

196
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,429
there's reasons towards doing that and

197
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,849
it's written in Ruby says is the most

198
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,120
potent system now why do people watering

199
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,839
water in the past a lot of people did it

200
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,769
for discovery of devices I trying to

201
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,410
find BBS or names of people to talk to

202
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,630
and they may have done it for malicious

203
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,829
intent of pranks on their friends you

204
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,660
know others with malicious them may have

205
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,790
done it to find carrier networks things

206
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,029
in the background or voicemails for

207
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,010
there's been a lot of voicemail hacking

208
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,040
or others like dialing insane a so are

209
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,480
are are places so on the security side

210
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,579
people will also be more dying to make

211
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,940
sure their devices are secure great you

212
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,290
don't want to have a modem sitting out

213
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,100
there that just has a password or no

214
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,760
passwords so

215
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,720
why would you want to ward out now from

216
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,149
an asset management standpoint knowing

217
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,740
what you have connected to your network

218
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,870
is pretty important you can't secure you

219
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,300
don't know is there free organic growth

220
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,579
people may be adding devices to your

221
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:49,230
network you don't even know of or their

222
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,920
devices rates in varies by industry but

223
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,779
the number of employees that have

224
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,639
telephony connected devices pretty much

225
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,980
everybody but it's kind of far away with

226
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,060
mobile devices and things they're not

227
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,500
actually connected to the telephony

228
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,209
network but things like building

229
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,990
controls alarm systems and often

230
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,790
connected to telephone clients for

231
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,490
backup now the last one is the recent

232
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,079
fax machines of a multifunctional

233
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,709
printers and if anybody saw it was 2018

234
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,269
presentation done at DEFCON where they

235
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,279
were actually bridging into a network

236
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,600
and exploiting and I guess an internal

237
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,839
network externally through a fax machine

238
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,970
using the tunnel blue I can only imagine

239
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,709
that that kind of thing is going to

240
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,180
become more popular as more people

241
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,779
research these fantasies but see how I'm

242
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,290
doing on time

243
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,209
and the priority realities we my company

244
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,160
no longer work for has a huge inventory

245
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
side numbers we have think close to a

246
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,610
million phone numbers and asset in the

247
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,279
Tor asset management system that is less

248
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,709
than perfect was that I mean that's

249
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,959
pretty daunting thinking we got dial

250
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,370
every single number at least one so

251
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,480
potentially multiple times a quarter

252
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,750
right we have legal issues to deal with

253
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,790
drafters we're not bad guys very we have

254
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,180
to comply with the law both domestic law

255
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,420
and international or if we're dialing

256
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,350
overseas they're going to be careful

257
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,009
with that in the time restrictions we

258
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,160
come dialed down voice lines of people

259
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,319
will pick up or do business on during

260
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:40,290
the day time and then there's also the

261
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,730
time restrictions if we've got to get it

262
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,860
done right he can't just be darling at

263
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,190
number a minute for the rest register my

264
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,510
career my hands

265
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,360
we have some requirements wanted to be

266
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
pretty automated distributed

267
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,530
cost-effective to run all basically

268
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,240
cheap to run because nobody wants to pay

269
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,660
a ton of money to see what's going to do

270
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,730
the other side of the phone line and

271
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,590
given the current tool set early the

272
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,780
only choice was warlocks so if you want

273
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,080
to Ward out what do you need and how do

274
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,340
you start your first again right so

275
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,180
pretty much you're going to need an

276
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,770
inventory of targets you can't just dial

277
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,060
every number because there's laws

278
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,210
against there in your let's say 704

279
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,020
prefix so you can be hard work to run

280
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,790
asterisk unlikely and that's everyone's

281
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,770
on just about anything but if you doing

282
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,650
it up volume like you're trying to call

283
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,970
a million numbers you're going to want

284
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,370
to run it on some pretty beefy hardware

285
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,050
something a bit better than a Raspberry

286
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,890
Pi a toaster oven it could be internal

287
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,510
it could be external it doesn't matter

288
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,180
as long as it cannot talk to each other

289
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,580
it should be good a station pretty much

290
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,980
Romany things so I've had a lot of fun

291
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,480
running it on Debian with a Debian

292
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,730
stable just because it's all packaged

293
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,960
nicely in the context of goods then you

294
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,030
can need some service I thought well we

295
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,590
can just use plain out telephone wire to

296
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,910
do this from my home phone

297
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,310
yes you could possibly do that but you

298
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,920
probably shouldn't just compliance and

299
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,620
legal reasons and it's going to be slow

300
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,570
if your business is willing to pay for

301
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,880
playing on telephone service you could

302
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,880
do it I know what the cost amount all

303
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,010
about cellular for a wildly well let's

304
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,350
get ten I'm limited to tell vampires and

305
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,960
run it through they're probably going

306
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,029
against the Terms of Service and then

307
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,630
there's these other services that come

308
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,700
to mind when you think about making

309
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,380
cheaper phone calls they describe Twilio

310
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,529
et cetera this is I believe that

311
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,089
describes pricing and we're looking at

312
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:56,500
$2.99 a month for two thousand minutes

313
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,630
notice may work for some people if you

314
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,510
only need to make a mm cause 15

315
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,360
sentiment free box yes but when you're

316
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,520
talking about a million phone numbers so

317
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,680
on scoggs gonna be about 150 thousand

318
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,200
dollars after that if she's trying to do

319
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,570
in a month

320
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,310
Tullio home I think it's about 1,300

321
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,560
bucks for the first hundred thousand

322
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,589
which isn't too terrible and then about

323
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,240
the next nine hundred thousand tons

324
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,270
about twelve thousand dollars so kind of

325
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,710
hard to swallow if you've got the budget

326
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,940
to work so really I would go with a void

327
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,740
provider you can get some really good

328
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,810
deals on the transit fare and it's

329
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,960
pretty inexpensive you don't really pay

330
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,640
per minute but it's built to fractions

331
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,310
of a minute

332
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,709
that's what we use and we ended up

333
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,610
spending way less then I probably should

334
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:54,009
have said current state Warhawks starts

335
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:58,509
release mm what's that being is good at

336
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,059
so unsupported there is no scheduling it

337
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,059
has very limited reporting in it you

338
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,980
there's analysis there I tell you what

339
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,579
it is

340
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:09,819
voice voice mail fax modem dial tone but

341
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:12,819
it is limited you it's very you'd have

342
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,589
to use it to kind of see see what I mean

343
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,430
with that we've been working to

344
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,550
modernize it a little bit with jobs

345
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,970
being able to submit a job scheduled

346
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,110
jobs so that you can set the numbers you

347
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,139
want leave for work and it will start

348
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,009
whenever you specify that's pretty

349
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,879
important for me that I want to be

350
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,639
starting scans everything we've been

351
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,100
working on making an inventory of

352
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,540
targets II know what you want to dial

353
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,279
you put it in database and it picks out

354
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,829
from those every night so you can scan

355
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:52,559
them working on improving rewarding

356
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,829
that's a big one for us because I mean

357
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:58,360
there's no point in the scanning if you

358
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,850
can't have a good report and have

359
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,699
something to show for it so that's

360
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,020
probably the biggest thing

361
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,209
and update we could do is show some

362
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,000
value from from this other than the

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,290
automation because nobody wants to

364
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,620
babysit we're adding they'll be doing a

365
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,600
bunch of research into you adding device

366
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,110
fingerprinting so that's mostly for fax

367
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,310
machines I've modified a very old fact

368
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,709
sender to connect to a fax machine

369
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:31,080
graphic configuration parameters from it

370
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,110
and then hang up the line and then the

371
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,470
modem dialing in screenshots we're

372
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,850
turning into a modem taking a screenshot

373
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,490
once you're connected so we can quickly

374
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,320
go through and say okay these are all

375
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,420
password-protected and these are good

376
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,100
together so let's see we're about 20

377
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,060
minutes the results we have we went from

378
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,680
about 120 calls per hour so it's two

379
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,420
channels to everything over 500 and

380
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,619
we're able to scan it 20,000 numbers in

381
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:17,160
about 16 30 days so what we found

382
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,439
there's a bunch of stuff that does not

383
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,309
match the inventory modems whether not

384
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,900
supposed to be fax machines when they're

385
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,420
not supposed to be we have voicemails

386
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,730
where other fax machines are supposed to

387
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,390
be and some really odd find these where

388
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,890
there be a dial tone like your darlings

389
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,960
a number

390
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,000
it would just be a dog attack they might

391
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,380
be false positives

392
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,130
I can't reproduce it on all of them but

393
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,730
that's kind of alarming is there any

394
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,920
questions well what we presented today

395
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,140
if you want to get started into those

396
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,480
two resources the operative stuff is

397
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,600
probably your best bet I'm going to be

398
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,940
publishing all my changes I made to

399
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,410
github so everybody else can enjoy the

400
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:16,250
pleasures of all that that is about air

401
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,910
of thing no questions all right go on

402
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,060
so you

403
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:31,450
yeah we've the question was when you

404
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,659
wore them Sinn féin modems what was

405
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,820
hanging off of it there are a ton of

406
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,509
modems out there still connected

407
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:43,330
I don't know exactly what was behind

408
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,379
them but a lot of times it's building

409
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:52,738
controls IOT backup for alarm systems

410
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,169
what else was there environmental

411
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,729
control surgeries I mean there's also

412
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,769
like backup service lines in to take the

413
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,129
centers in case fiber good spot for up

414
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,349
maintenance there's some of the things

415
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:05,950
I'm aware of

416
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,029
I don't know why I was hanging on the

417
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,509
other end of of my my fighting days

418
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:20,499
anymore it's I guess I think everybody

419
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:21,940
should be if you're working in an

420
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,279
enterprise doing more dialing and seeing

421
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,019
what is on on the other side of your

422
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:28,659
telephone lines because they have we had

423
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:31,809
a huge effort as a while back before us

424
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,509
to go through a major with modems was

425
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,539
Hewlett with passwords but as we know

426
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,659
through IT work oftentimes stuff gets

427
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,450
rolled back from I guess changed up

428
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,759
dates get rolled back and we can't be

429
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,379
sure that there are moments hanging out

430
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:56,679
there don't have passwords or how do we

431
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,330
know the perimeter was the question I

432
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,710
like the telephony sorry so we have an

433
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,259
internal database right of all every

434
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:12,489
device connected to that in theory so

435
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,799
that's one way we know but there are

436
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,859
certain reports from your carriers so

437
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:21,399
say if you use the ATT Verizon on etc in

438
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:24,399
whatever every couple of years they're

439
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,580
required to do an audit on that and tell

440
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,200
you which phone numbers you have inserts

441
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,599
another way you can you can get

442
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,140
you have us because if you were about

443
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,130
time zoo Gemma

444
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,040
I thank you for a mere them give me

445
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,090
opportunity speak sir
