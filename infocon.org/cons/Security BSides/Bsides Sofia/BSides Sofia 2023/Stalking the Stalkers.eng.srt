34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,320
okay we went way too much

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,740
Okay the third one is single quote we

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,079
all know what this is the we're going to

37
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,119
see a lot of SQL detections saying this

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,960
talk

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,140
we usually use it to get access to data

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,600
we should not have but considering that

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,579
this is data that they should also not

42
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,160
have it's data that is free on the

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,919
internet as we see it

44
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,220
we want to give some special thanks the

45
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,520
first one is Elva gulpering she was the

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,340
leader she's the city of eff Electronic

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,680
Frontier Foundation and is the person

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,260
that helped us greatly on both the

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,220
ethical stance and the lot of

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,800
paperwork that we did from there we also

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
want to

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,020
help to thank Zach with Tacker who

53
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,140
helped us by giving a lot of press via

54
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,560
Tech runs on all the flows that we found

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,200
and the close friend that I have George

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,480
love dance who has helped us by writing

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,000
go binaries that could enumerate

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,760
millions of users

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,239
so first of all what's talk aware it's a

60
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,920
software that's often used to track

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,379
activities of somebody without their

62
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,680
knowledge or consent it's used to keep

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,140
track of a victim's location see their

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,140
call history internet history check

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,140
their you know emails produce videos and

66
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,379
audios from their devices access their

67
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,480
files you can take screenshots you know

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,379
you monitor it's like active stalking

69
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,480
okay

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,159
so for iPhone since there's no jailbreak

71
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,680
for the latest version what they do is

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,459
that they get the iCloud backup so you

73
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,739
would log into because usually you know

74
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,340
Partners they have access to the other

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,799
signifi the significant others phone so

76
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,440
they could just you know go there

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,799
get a credentials get the access tokens

78
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,720
and then configure

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,040
the iCloud and then from there the stock

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,620
aware platform would scrape the data

81
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,659
every 24 hours

82
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,200
and you know the abusive like partner

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,799
will have access to all this data

84
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
apple is actually tackling this they

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,220
they introduced in January

86
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,500
the option to encrypt uh they are called

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,978
backups but it's not compulsory so it's

88
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,560
still a problem you know and an abuser

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,919
would have access to Whatsapp SMS call

90
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,340
logs which hotspots a Wi-Fi hotspots

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,759
their significant order connected to

92
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,340
and all this kind of stuff

93
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,699
on Android if you don't have root access

94
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,340
you know you can see the victim's

95
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,139
location you can get the files that are

96
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,540
stored in external storage because

97
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,479
they're not sandboxed you can read text

98
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,720
messages you can read call information

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,639
and if you're you have root access which

100
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,979
is not that hard it's like game over

101
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,060
because well you're root that's it

102
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,699
um in most cases stock aware is

103
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,639
installed without the victim's consent

104
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,880
but sometimes you know the the partner

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,979
can just blackmail saying things like oh

106
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,880
do you have anything to write to to hide

107
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,060
or if you don't love me enough why are

108
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,500
you with me you should give me this

109
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,660
access because I'm just doing it because

110
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,280
I love you

111
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,520
and the application it's usually hidden

112
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,360
and has like some nice name like battery

113
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,240
or notepad or calculator so it's trying

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,479
to conceal it's real intent from the

115
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,660
user and what I I never thought about

116
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,699
before but it's really disgusting is

117
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,979
that the infected device can actually be

118
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,380
gifted to someone and they actually

119
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,020
advertise it for example this

120
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,740
here

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,460
they oh a Christmas present your loved

122
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,680
ones will truly appreciate and you give

123
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,199
them like a nice Android tablet that you

124
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,259
know has stalkerware installed on it and

125
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,120
the other person will be able to ask you

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,919
know invade up somebody else's privacy

127
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,758
really

128
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,740
so how do we know something is talking

129
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,820
where

130
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,180
first of all uh if they actively

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,600
advertise as something that you can use

132
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,699
to spy your wife

133
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,520
we consider it stalkerware also a

134
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,340
friendly advice if you actually have a

135
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,639
wife don't Google this thing because

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,380
then you have to explain to your wife

137
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,199
that you're doing research and to your

138
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,639
kids that you are doing your research

139
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,560
and you don't have anything to spy your

140
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,759
wife on but yeah it's if they actively

141
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,860
spend money on advertisements on how to

142
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,280
spy your wife their stalker wear

143
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,060
the fine line is consent as Felipe said

144
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,720
if it doesn't need consent it's spyware

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
if it's it's stalkerware if it's

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,419
designed to hide itself it's stalkerware

147
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,300
knowing the password or the PIN for the

148
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
for the laptop or the phone doesn't

149
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,060
change that if someone installs

150
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,699
something which is hidden and the person

151
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,180
who is spied has not consent on it it's

152
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,000
a stalkerware victim

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,819
the first thing that you can see in here

154
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,419
is cocoa spy they have actively

155
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,800
articles how to read my wife's text

156
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
messages without her knowing for free

157
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,020
it's a two page article that says how to

158
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,000
spy your wife they're obviously

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
Nostalgia where

160
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,220
the hello spy which is now defunct uh

161
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,220
it's probably the worst case that you

162
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,180
can see

163
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,960
sitting by the Numbers it says how the

164
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,259
person uh the guy who had that seated

165
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,419
wife and beat it here you can see

166
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,479
actively marks on her face and keep in

167
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,440
mind hello spy is with the bitters uh

168
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,280
side so they are even promoting fiscal

169
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,539
violence

170
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,380
they are off business now but it's it's

171
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,660
just a monstrosity as you say they're

172
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,560
genuinely bad people

173
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,440
so we took a better look on the industry

174
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,639
how it was how big it was

175
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,620
we were able to find 10 companies that

176
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,539
create applications they host their

177
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,520
servers they massively skin their

178
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
applications so we are going to see

179
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,360
later down the road that we are a lot of

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,219
applications are actually one

181
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,200
application they sell the application

182
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,958
with three skin rights they white label

183
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,820
the application and also providing

184
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,039
infrastructure for it I effectively

185
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,640
being stalkerware as a service

186
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,620
and we are going to call them family

187
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,140
from there on if somebody is a family

188
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,320
it's one of those 10 companies

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,660
two of the families as we're going to

190
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,820
see further down were sweat shops where

191
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,779
proper support lines they had proper uh

192
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,899
lines that escalated to level two level

193
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,600
three and one of the big ones which was

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
one of the scariest ones maintained

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
personas even within the company

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,959
constantly changing names and company

197
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
names we infiltrated the company and

198
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,540
even between them they didn't use Felipe

199
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,459
or Vangelis they were doing they were

200
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,220
using fake personas so that they cannot

201
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
be spotted on what they were doing

202
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,000
that's the initial data of the families

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
that we have found one is the truth spy

204
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,300
you can see that we have identified the

205
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,640
company that they're owned by for most

206
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,540
of them

207
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,959
two of them Stand Out spy track and

208
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,880
through spy uh

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,940
so the two sets that we use for our

210
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,600
research was burp Suite to do the mostly

211
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
the API testing and tampering the

212
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,600
requests and keep a history of what

213
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,339
we're doing so we can go back and check

214
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,820
data

215
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,680
um jdex the compiler to reverse engineer

216
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,100
uh the apks

217
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,140
APK lab.io to

218
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,019
run the apks without having to install

219
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,540
them on your phone and do an analysis of

220
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,519
them

221
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,100
movad which is a VPN provider we use

222
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,260
that so we because I don't want them to

223
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,100
know my home IP address basically

224
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,019
we had a small droplet on digital ocean

225
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,459
to to host files and get reverse shells

226
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,800
because again don't want to expose my

227
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,959
home IP address

228
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,180
revolut was really useful for when we

229
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,519
had to for some reason buy an account

230
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,459
because in some cases it was useful

231
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,560
uh because I could just spawn a credit

232
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,060
card they wouldn't check my name I could

233
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,160
put any name in there any Dodge address

234
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,260
you just say yeah whatever and I could

235
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,660
set a limit and just freeze the credit

236
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,640
card afterwards because some of them

237
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,560
kept trying to charge me

238
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,260
which wasn't ideal

239
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,920
um Showdown was also really helpful

240
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,380
because as you're gonna see later some

241
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,440
companies like cloudflare were

242
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,899
protecting these guys so we use Showdown

243
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,940
to find their real IP addresses and

244
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,839
bypass Cloud security and our cancerous

245
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,700
Android phone which is we'll probably

246
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,260
have to bin it at some point it's

247
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,500
disgusting now it's relevant

248
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,100
and yeah our methodology was first we're

249
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,860
going to try see if they offered a demo

250
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,740
account which most of them did and then

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,140
from there I would see if you could just

252
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,360
hack them from there find some secret

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,940
injection access controls

254
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,160
some of them had limitations like the

255
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,480
API would

256
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,519
the account would only have access to

257
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,300
the get requests and no posts or puts so

258
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,579
so people wouldn't be able to modify

259
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,920
data there and that's a limitation and

260
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,040
hard to make it harder to exploit so

261
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
yeah and then if we've managed to find

262
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,560
an APK we would download it then

263
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,680
decompile see we've confined uh API

264
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,440
endpoints Swagger files hard-coded

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,899
credentials and then

266
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,620
will run the APK on APK lab sandbox so

267
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,019
we wouldn't you know let that crazy

268
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,459
thing touch our phone

269
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,760
and then get some data from there but if

270
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,339
we couldn't find anything useful then we

271
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,839
would install the APK on our Android

272
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,420
phone prox data through burp and then

273
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,899
interact with the API and in some cases

274
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,540
if we thought that was really worth it

275
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,519
we would purchase an account

276
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,980
so we could you know further exploit

277
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,899
their

278
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,540
their application

279
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,800
so

280
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,779
uh as most of them not most all of them

281
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,300
uh are zero days right now we had a

282
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,800
really big discussion with a lot of

283
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,639
people

284
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,279
and we are not going to release the zero

285
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,579
days we are not going to say how we

286
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,839
accessed all the data we are going to

287
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,740
see

288
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,540
a view of the data we're going to

289
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,720
explain some of the data but giving out

290
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
the zero days would give access to a lot

291
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,880
of vulnerable people

292
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,180
the plan is we want to see that industry

293
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,920
burn we the eff and pretty much everyone

294
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
else the Coalition against uh stalker

295
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,639
were want to destroy that industry

296
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,680
what was the plan we need to have a

297
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,899
better understanding of the size of the

298
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,779
industry and as we were looking more and

299
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,000
more we were really scared of seeing

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
that the the size of the companies and

301
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,279
the how many installation it has we

302
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,079
wanted to identify what company was

303
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,380
behind its application we were mostly

304
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,820
successful on that

305
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,220
we are still working on a way to help

306
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,579
the victims this is not that easy we

307
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,500
were thinking about removing the

308
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,760
applications we were thinking about

309
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,500
sending a post notification and saying

310
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,740
that your phone is actively monitored

311
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,200
this is not that easy and not that

312
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,480
straightforward because a lot of those

313
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,339
victims are

314
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,519
in a really strange position in a bad

315
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,120
relationship or in a way that they this

316
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
could cause more harm than benefit

317
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,420
we communicated with apple and eff

318
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,260
the ethical stance it was really one of

319
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,820
those

320
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,639
researches that there was no clear way

321
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,380
of what we were supposed to be doing

322
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,720
there are the obvious issues of what are

323
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,240
we going to do are we going to disclose

324
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,360
the zero days and help the companies

325
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,459
solve the issues and continue giving

326
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:54,300
them things to work on are we just going

327
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,880
to publicly disclose and give all the

328
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,980
data to to everyone it's clearly a which

329
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,779
side are you on are you with the good

330
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,240
guys are you with the bad guys there's

331
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,620
no sides in here we try to do no harm we

332
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,480
try to help no one

333
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,820
we could easily submit for everything

334
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,880
for 15 CVS but we would be helping them

335
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,420
to secure something we want to turn them

336
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,260
down we need to kill everything so what

337
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,480
we have found remote command execution

338
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,019
and more than one servers SQL injection

339
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,920
SQL injection

340
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,480
broken authentication and the scale

341
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,720
injection forgotten AWS credentials that

342
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,180
gave us root access to a lot of

343
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,680
infrastructure forget an Azure

344
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,260
credential which gave us access to even

345
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,940
more infrastructure

346
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,440
SQL injection

347
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,199
and another SQL injection

348
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,500
the data that we acquired was database

349
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,980
dumps included super sensitive data like

350
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,300
text sms's WhatsApp messages

351
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,300
everywhere and where they were about

352
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,420
we got dumps of everyone's phone which

353
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,220
is really scary if you consider what

354
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,440
your phone has

355
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
lots of way to identify owners emails

356
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,160
home addresses pretty much everything

357
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,600
access to administrative accounts and

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,420
panels so we had access internally to

359
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,019
support to panels to creating to

360
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,139
financial data we had access to source

361
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,480
code and their comments with her really

362
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,360
funny and surprises

363
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,779
as Felipe mentioned earlier all those

364
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,300
companies

365
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,139
helped enabled enabled them sorry and

366
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,620
protected uh the bad people Alibaba

367
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,000
Amazon and azure

368
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,019
were hosting them we have sent numerous

369
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,079
emails saying and they said that this is

370
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
within their policy so stalkerware and

371
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,180
actively exploring people is within

372
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,059
their policy cloudflare was even worse

373
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,160
they said that they're paying customers

374
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,859
we are not paying customers so we're not

375
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,240
going to do anything so they wanted us

376
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,359
to pay so that they can review what we

377
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,579
reported and Mandarin was just sending

378
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,020
emails so it's release bad of them

379
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,780
I'm gonna mention Google in here

380
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,579
it made it really obvious that the

381
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,140
malicious applications were installed

382
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,640
and made it really difficult to continue

383
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,080
running so it uninstalled them it so

384
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,100
multiple uh pop-ups saying you have

385
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,840
something which is stalking you please

386
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
remove it please remove it uh Google

387
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
Play Store stepped up and removed all

388
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,960
the stalkerware and Google search since

389
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,880
after our talk they reached out and they

390
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,500
are not accepting ads for spyware

391
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
anymore so you're not going to see any

392
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,020
advertisements for stalker World spyware

393
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,179
now

394
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,760
code that we have seen

395
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,059
SEC for formulas index starts with zero

396
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,500
checked with

397
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,160
F Tony why this it is needed this is

398
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,799
directly of from the source code

399
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,419
save this environmental because if

400
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,820
someone finds it out he's going to f us

401
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,299
guess what we found out we did it

402
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,520
changing this because the hacker hacked

403
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,020
us well

404
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,700
you have some bad news again for you

405
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
guys

406
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,460
also

407
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,580
I have found that in multiple locations

408
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,799
so they were run somewhere more than

409
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,380
once in more than one family and they

410
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,620
were just restracted and restarted

411
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,539
everything so their fires were exhibited

412
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,080
more than once in more than one family

413
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,780
the data analytics first of all the last

414
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,780
thing we're not that analysts data is in

415
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,660
way better hands we're running analytics

416
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,960
in there eff is working on it we're

417
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,080
trying to do the best thing that we can

418
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,460
do with that data symbol is 400

419
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,380
000 devices from three different

420
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,260
families location is from GPS so it's

421
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,240
not ipt location when something says

422
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,340
it's there it's there and the duration

423
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,520
of installation we Define that as the

424
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,900
first installation the last

425
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,740
communication with the their C2 server

426
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,140
these are the

427
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,780
countries that we can see you can see a

428
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,820
lot of strange things in here first of

429
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,400
all ugada has a really really strange

430
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,039
marriage problem they

431
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,620
30 000 people spider wives

432
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,780
China is okay United Kingdom is

433
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,059
something that we expected Bangladesh to

434
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,039
and Nepal are crazy numbers we didn't

435
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,320
expect that but that's what the GPS is

436
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,620
saying

437
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,340
as you can see 88 of the smartphones

438
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,580
that we see was Android only 12 were

439
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,820
iPhone

440
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,580
and 50 percent had installed from one to

441
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,980
three months twenty percent had only for

442
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,260
one month and 30 percent had it more

443
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,419
than three months with five devices

444
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,059
going up to eight years so someone was

445
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,940
spying on his significant other for

446
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,520
eight years

447
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,340
and we know we missed

448
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,580
some of the stalker families we tried

449
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,980
our best to cover the whole industry but

450
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,400
some of them were not vulnerable or some

451
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,220
of them were really expensive and it

452
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,960
didn't make sense for us to pay 500

453
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,760
euros just so that we can pound

454
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,740
something so

455
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,260
I'm going to talk about a truth spy

456
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,179
which is one of the guys that we

457
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,400
compromised and it's the biggest one

458
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,860
right no no it's the biggest one that

459
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,520
it's still alive oh great so yeah it has

460
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,860
been compromised multiple times it was

461
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,559
totally examined by TechCrunch they have

462
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,380
articles about it and during your

463
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,080
research we uh found out that was

464
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
developed and operated by one byte and

465
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,580
it had approximately uh 200 000 users we

466
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,799
managed to identify 12 members of this

467
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,840
family but there's probably more than

468
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,799
that

469
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
and

470
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,760
yeah with their platform the abusers

471
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,460
could see call histories monitor

472
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,520
applications uh see notification

473
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,340
histories location access to photos and

474
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,220
videos

475
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,200
the key logger functionality to you know

476
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,840
see what you're what they spouses were

477
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,720
texting and yeah here's you can see

478
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,860
there

479
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,460
uh the panel that they had access to you

480
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,140
could get like a share as well in some

481
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,880
cases yes

482
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,580
and yeah and when you run it on uh virus

483
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,539
total that's what you'll get so it's not

484
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,320
like

485
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,559
a great identification rate really only

486
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,039
25 vendors saw it as malicious

487
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,659
and

488
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,299
well we managed to fully compromise it

489
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,000
like root access to the server

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,760
uh database access we had everything

491
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,360
and here is uh the structure of their

492
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,880
their company as it was reported by

493
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,299
TechCrunch so

494
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,100
yeah you guys can see it in our blog

495
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,679
post later with more detail

496
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,240
and

497
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,480
yeah AdSense pie was

498
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,820
um here here we can see there

499
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,980
um the website

500
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,140
they were marked and operated by

501
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,419
connects

502
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,460
um we found that they had approximately

503
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,720
60 000 users and only one family member

504
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,620
which is xnspy.com

505
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,100
um and yeah as pretty much all of them

506
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,380
you could see call histories more into

507
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,260
replications notifications had access to

508
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,550
photos

509
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,220
[Music]

510
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,760
and again virus total only 24 vendors

511
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,740
saw it as malicious

512
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,000
so yeah they were not doing a great job

513
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,440
and yeah we got full database access

514
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,840
which is well if you consider they're

515
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,600
really vulnerable people that's not

516
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,179
ideal right and it's you know it's not a

517
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,159
good feeling when you see that you you

518
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
know with people's private lives there

519
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,120
it's it's awful it's vulnerable it's

520
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,940
access to anyone on the internet

521
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,500
and

522
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,039
yeah

523
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,159
um

524
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,220
Coco's pie they were the trickiest one

525
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,159
to identify who was the owner

526
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,400
and we had to do a lot of digging and we

527
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,320
have like strong indications that they

528
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,740
operated by 711.icu

529
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,740
and went and fight three members in the

530
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,860
family

531
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,720
um that on their platform you could see

532
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,559
how histories you could they're pretty

533
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,740
much most of them they Supply the same

534
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,140
um features for the abusers really so

535
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,880
location history access to photos and

536
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,080
videos

537
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,200
and same crappy identification rate in

538
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,059
virus Toto as well

539
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,360
and then they had broken access controls

540
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,539
we couldn't get any database access but

541
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,860
we got uh access to all users info this

542
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,140
one was really painful because we

543
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,539
actually had to use they every user for

544
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,340
some reason has an active directory

545
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,740
account so we had

546
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,740
enumerate via using ldap which is

547
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,799
painful and slow so it took a lot of

548
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,400
time for that

549
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,559
um yeah Moby stealth these guys they're

550
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,659
like

551
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,240
they're just funny because you see on

552
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,059
their website they see osc on Yahoo PC

553
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,880
World MSN wired and then if you go there

554
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
you Google it's like it's not saying

555
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,840
good things about this company you know

556
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,120
they're saying yo these dodgy guys are

557
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,860
you know they're disgusting but then

558
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,240
they are like promoting it's you know

559
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,919
they're talking about us but they know

560
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,760
them but they know them yeah

561
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,419
and yeah it's been around for 10 years

562
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,740
over 125 000 devices it was compromised

563
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,500
in 2018 and yeah we couldn't find the

564
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,740
owner unfortunately and yeah there's

565
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,919
only one member of the family

566
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,799
and they were not using an API

567
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,299
which is

568
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,059
awful because we had to parse

569
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,240
poorly written HTML manually manually I

570
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,460
had to write a script for it and it had

571
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,000
more than a billion entries so yeah

572
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,580
it was painful

573
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,520
and yeah we managed to fully compromise

574
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,679
it and became administrators of the

575
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,360
platform

576
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,760
but yeah we hope one day we'll figure

577
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,760
out who's behind them

578
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,000
uh spymaster Pro they're not really

579
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,460
they're just another one really there's

580
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,580
nothing really special about them

581
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,919
they they had like 8 000 devices

582
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,960
available

583
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,419
it was compromised in 2018 and someone

584
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,440
buying netsense

585
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,480
and yeah same features that pretty much

586
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,279
other platform again they're just

587
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,799
they're not really like passion in in

588
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,220
any way but

589
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,059
yeah

590
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,960
I mean and last one not last one second

591
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,260
last one is spy track it's the scariest

592
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,000
of all uh the biggest of one as it has

593
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,620
over

594
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
one million and three thousand devices

595
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,419
and currently the more dataful because

596
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,840
we took it down it's owned by support

597
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,900
King support King was fined by the FTC

598
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,480
and banned from the spyware industry it

599
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,640
only had one members might spytrack.com

600
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,299
it relabeled everything as spy tracked

601
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,919
on November of uh 2021

602
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,620
it's as I said the scariest of all

603
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,779
it had any functionality you could think

604
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,640
of you could live track the device you

605
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
had live access on microphone you had

606
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,779
live access of both cameras it's really

607
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,779
scary if someone from the UK sees your

608
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,140
cameras in Greece you it also had

609
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,039
location key logger but it also had the

610
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,120
smallest detection rate of all uh the

611
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,700
things in here

612
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,559
and we owned everything again we got

613
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,600
root access we got database access

614
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,080
the we got email access we have it

615
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,419
everything we were able to pinpoint it

616
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,760
to support King find out that support

617
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,720
King which was banned by the FCC

618
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,400
uh then went to Zach on uh the crunch

619
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,320
TechCrunch sorry I forgot the techrance

620
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,080
I shouldn't and told him that this is

621
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
support King they're still doing that

622
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,720
they're linked to a new spying operation

623
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,620
and this was on Monday on Tuesday the

624
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,299
product was temporarily not available

625
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,320
so we consider that a win

626
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,919
uh PC tattoo tail is a really small one

627
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
and the fine and the funny one because

628
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,020
they give us their name it's Brian

629
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,419
Fleming it's that guy it has Android and

630
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,760
piece application it has around 60 000

631
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,100
users it only goes by PC tattletail.com

632
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,020
you could only do that record screen and

633
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,919
keylogger uh it was so and so on the

634
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,159
identification level

635
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,679
it had a very permission a permissive

636
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,200
API it was leaking data it was licking

637
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,020
keys and you could get free upgrades so

638
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,360
we were able to pay for one device and

639
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,000
then get 100 devices and we were able to

640
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,059
have 365 days data retention while

641
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,520
usually it's 30. I know we shouldn't use

642
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,380
it but that's about it

643
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,799
and he was really really proud of

644
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,000
himself so he's saying that he's signing

645
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,100
that show At Your Service Brian Fleming

646
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,460
is the signature of the emails from that

647
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,919
device so it was the easiest one to find

648
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,679
who was behind it

649
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,220
and we are coming to an end uh the

650
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,440
ethicalities did we succeed on what we

651
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,360
said in the beginning of the talk

652
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,419
we're ready for the consequences we give

653
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,220
the same token besides London we were

654
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,539
thinking that we are going to get some

655
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,960
legal actions uh against us we still

656
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,480
haven't got one so we consider that a

657
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,799
win

658
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,440
and the outcome as we said in the

659
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,620
beginning we had a lot a lot of data

660
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,240
shared with Coalition against stalker

661
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,659
where NW ndff we're working on a

662
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,419
solution to actively help exploited

663
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,320
people

664
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,659
we added a lot of RS in the quiver of

665
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,720
eff Coalition against other companies

666
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,399
against the industry

667
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,220
and communicate that this is an active

668
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,500
problem this interesting needs to be
