1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,159
foreign

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,820
first I know I'm the last person between

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
you and the drinks so I'll try to keep

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,340
to my schedule of 20 minutes or so a

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,560
second I know it's been

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,840
uh long to this video I'm not gonna bore

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,760
you hopefully you're gonna find it

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,380
interesting but before we go I need to

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,960
say two key points

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
this is my personal Takeaway on purple

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,040
team I don't represent my employer and

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,899
second important point is if something

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,520
goes bad and not responsible so

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,059
yeah

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,500
before we go I'm gonna take the

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,300
opportunity to tell you a couple words

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,300
about myself how do I recharge I love

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,500
running and I love hiking and who am I

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,820
well I've been in the cyber security

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,860
industry let's say

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,519
the good size of more than 10 years uh

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,439
most of my experience was gained in the

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,619
UK and I recently moved back to Bulgaria

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,420
and I'm here now to talk to you about

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,180
cyber security and specifically about

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,700
purple TeenNick but before we go into

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,439
the purple teaming we need to know what

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,960
a bad pyramid is well

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,700
first time when I heard about what bad

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,500
pyramid is I had like 10 things running

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,299
through my head like what does that mean

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,880
and I decided to

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,159
uh find out

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,220
and if you ask chargipti nowadays you're

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,079
gonna get one of the things that was in

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,740
my head which is effectively

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,979
uh top heavy organization well I had

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,180
that running in my head the other thing

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,860
that I had running in my head was well

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,280
if you ask your local Mafia mafia boss

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,619
nephew obviously I don't know if he was

42
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,640
going to tell you well the reason such

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,799
as King was a bad pyramid but apparently

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,020
there is and we need to know about that

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,740
to understand purple teaming when we

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,979
talk about sidebar and we talk about the

47
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,360
technical people inside but we can

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,220
roughly split them into three different

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,500
buckets one of them is the people who

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,819
build stuff the other one is the people

51
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,620
who attack stuff and the other one is

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,900
the people who defend stuff and each one

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,200
of them have their own color

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,760
the people who built it they have their

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,040
color code yellow we have people who

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,140
attacked their color called red and have

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,000
the people who defend style color called

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,239
Blue hence where we have

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,459
red and blue merging that's why we have

60
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,040
purple team

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,180
well that implies is going to be

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,520
something as a joint venture between

63
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
these two teams I know that quite a lot

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,580
of words here I'm going to talk about

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,860
all of them just key takeaways this is a

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,519
formal definition uh from nist

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,560
what the red team does the main

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,400
objective of direct team is to improve

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,040
and emphasize on that is to improve the

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Enterprise information assurance by

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
demonstrating two things uh successful

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,860
attacks one and what works for the blue

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,080
team whereas the blue team is

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,739
responsible for defending the

75
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,260
organization assets

76
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,519
to a good level of security posture from

77
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,340
things like trade actors

78
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,659
retinos if you like and so forth and so

79
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,819
forth so we can see

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,480
what each team is responsible for

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,980
and now we go into the paperwork

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,080
back in the day

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,239
things will not start well

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,760
standardized people doing red teams

85
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,860
and they were asked to do ratings but we

86
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,720
didn't had Frameworks to go to

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,940
attraction of what the red team is

88
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,659
and eventually after let's say a slow

89
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,519
start

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,319
Bank of England introduced something

91
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,080
called sea best which is effectively

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,959
intelligence red intelligence LED red

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,940
team a kick-started with two successful

94
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,220
organizations being on board in 2017 so

95
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,500
let's say

96
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,540
2017 was probably the first of my

97
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,560
knowledge

98
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,858
formal framework I.E paperwork that

99
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,500
helps you to do a purple team shortly

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
afterwards 2018 European Central Bank

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,300
they introduced their own take of it

102
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,639
which is stable

103
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,759
unlike the C best the type is not

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,280
mandatory is optional which means that

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,800
well organizations do that if they want

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,620
to and another difference there is that

107
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,500
every country in the European Union can

108
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
have their own take on table type of

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,199
Netherlands being one of them

110
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,120
uh I do have another three over here for

111
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,100
completeness I'm not exporting this but

112
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,979
they're there to show that other parts

113
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,199
of the world have their own take on how

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,139
purple teams to be done uh well based on

115
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,580
your geographical region you need to

116
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,500
comply with one of these if you want to

117
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,560
do a purple team

118
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,220
and so wow on paper but actually how do

119
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,540
we do that well

120
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,720
took hand come more Frameworks sorry to

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,780
say that but yeah and one of the things

122
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,720
that I believe kick-started the formal

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
process of standardizing purple team was

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,940
Lockheed Martin

125
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,160
uh back in the day that was a quite lint

126
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,160
in my eyes kill chain but now I

127
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,900
understand the value of it and the

128
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,759
people took that to the next level they

129
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,580
introduced Mitra attack framework and

130
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,220
some tools come into hand over here

131
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,620
we'll come run away with some tools I

132
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,840
try to be then diagnostic but well it's

133
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,820
a big names I can't just ignore them

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,620
they contributed a lot to the purple

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,560
teaming and we have a commercial tool

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,020
and we'll have uh some free playbooks

137
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,060
out there why am I saying that

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm sorry about this I explicitly asked

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,080
I know it's more front

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,720
it does look different on different

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,240
operating systems I don't know why uh

142
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,020
apologies again

143
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,759
yeah like a joke thanks it's Friday

144
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,139
afternoon uh so what a purple team is we

145
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,539
talk about Frameworks and executions but

146
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,180
what what comes here over here is that

147
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,780
actually that's a full on Blown uh

148
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,060
project so a very rather project it has

149
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,060
its stages the first stage is

150
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,520
information gathering thank you uh which

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,380
is effectively cyber threat intelligence

152
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,660
which is normally done by an

153
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,340
organization in this case let's say

154
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,639
organization a and the key Focus series

155
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,960
on that is to deliver two things

156
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,220
intelligence reports

157
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,800
and the second thing important here is

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,419
that this threat intelligence import

159
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,000
might actually have to be able to be

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
forwarded to another third organization

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
and then we go into the preparation

162
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
phase where

163
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,440
in this case organization B took the

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,419
organization a right intelligence report

165
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,360
and bills on top of that what we want to

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,680
have here as a key outcomes is a plan

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,819
of what is to be executed uh going back

168
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,620
to Lockheed Martin Q chain and a key way

169
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,479
of communication change so we need to

170
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,539
know who is to communicate what to whom

171
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,460
third stage is to execute a purple team

172
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,319
obviously that's what the name implies

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,800
execute the already approved

174
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,220
uh kill chain if you like uh again

175
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,400
communication is a key so at Key stages

176
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,960
of the execution

177
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,639
the organization that executes the

178
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,259
purple team needs to communicate what's

179
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,479
approved with the client

180
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,240
and in my eyes the most important lesson

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,699
here is well we're all trying to improve

182
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,120
right uh as people perform a set nothing

183
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,419
is secure hence we have detection and

184
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,979
response and that's what we're trying to

185
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,199
do here so with the purple team we give

186
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,000
the blue blue team

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
away to analyze

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,539
attack outcome where we clearly know

189
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,300
what the attack was

190
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,099
analyze what alerts were raised from

191
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,259
that attack and what alerts were not

192
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,099
raised and improve on the tools

193
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,560
documentation and processes so next time

194
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,419
when they have a similar attack things

195
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,520
actually are going to be flagged in

196
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,159
action appropriately

197
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,458
and we go into the Q chain so

198
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,200
um I'm not gonna go in the detail of

199
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,279
this

200
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,799
uh everyone can read it the point here

201
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,480
is

202
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,720
when you do a purple team

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,899
I would suggest highly advice to stick

204
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,220
to the Q chain

205
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,800
and drill down in each one of these

206
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,440
bullet points to a reasonable level of

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,200
detail and and have that approved by the

208
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,580
client

209
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,279
so you can think of a reconnaissance so

210
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,660
we can think of all so that's what we

211
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,940
want to do and break down that two to

212
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,560
three different bullet points and you

213
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,000
have your clients agreeing on that

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,339
before you actually start doing the

215
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,779
execution

216
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,839
oh this one looks good uh I know it's a

217
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,160
lot of words

218
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,500
the point here is well

219
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,339
that sounds pretty much like a red team

220
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:30,740
no it's not

221
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,360
uh what's the difference between a

222
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
purple team and a red team I can talk

223
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,899
let's say half an hour or one hour on

224
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,019
that topic I've done it now I want to

225
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,480
introduce you to the purple team

226
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,420
and I want to avoid confusion so here

227
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,500
I'm gonna just give you three different

228
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
three key differences what is a red team

229
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,660
versus a purple team the first one is

230
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,040
the purple team

231
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,420
actually simulates attack or attacks

232
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,080
while a red team is two action on

233
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,920
objectives defined by the client so

234
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,019
direct team is not limited to specific

235
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,420
attacks and attack paths that are

236
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,640
pre-approved by the client I they're not

237
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,459
limited to approved kill chain

238
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,700
uh second key difference is

239
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,940
a purple team might require a client to

240
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,380
interact with two different

241
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,300
organizations one of them is to perform

242
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
the threat intelligence the other one is

243
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,600
to perform the actual execution

244
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,339
whereas with the red team that could be

245
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,500
done well just by one organization

246
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,339
that's going to do the threat

247
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,959
intelligence and the actual execution

248
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,240
and the third key difference is that

249
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
I didn't mention that but it's a good

250
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,959
way to introduce it during

251
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,979
a purple team

252
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,940
the red team and The Blue Team talk a

253
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,640
lot by that I mean they might have

254
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,180
regular workshops on every 24 hours for

255
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,480
48 hours where they sync up and they're

256
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,459
a teaming well just common says that's

257
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,899
what we did

258
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,120
did you sell us what did you saw and

259
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,000
whatnot this is really really timely

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,579
feedback for the blue team

261
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,100
during the actual execution which means

262
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,920
that they can go and

263
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,260
see what has been caught and what has

264
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,940
been missed by the two quite easily

265
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,220
whereas with the red team

266
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,680
an organization just does what it does

267
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,660
and let's say for the sake of the

268
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,000
argument the report is being delayed not

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,300
being approved lands on the blue team's

270
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,600
desk let's say after a month or so and

271
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,940
they need to go back and dig through the

272
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,860
lock locks of what happened one month

273
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,680
ago and why the tools didn't get it well

274
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,740
it's quite painful and it doesn't really

275
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,839
help them to improve

276
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,480
and I know I introduced a new topic and

277
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,640
we'll think well another type of

278
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,220
assessment well sorry which assessment

279
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,920
is appropriate for us probably you've

280
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,680
seen that it's my take again uh well

281
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,899
other people's supports as well

282
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,860
but as a very basic

283
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,019
every organization should do a

284
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,820
vulnerability scanning

285
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,740
and it depends on how mature is the

286
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,200
organization they gonna go towards the

287
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,180
purple side of things and we can see

288
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,060
from a basic scan we go to assessment

289
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,940
pen testing Red Team all this kind of

290
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,200
buzzwords and we reached the purple team

291
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,940
the one that I try to introduce you

292
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,740
today and we'll have something a little

293
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,060
bit more advanced called over here

294
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,339
Advanced simulation but yeah maybe

295
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,279
that's a topic for another day

296
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,980
and I think I stick quite well with the

297
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,760
timing any questions

298
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,980
I didn't bore you today did I please

299
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,210
thank you

300
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,639
[Applause]
