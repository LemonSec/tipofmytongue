1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
the room at the end of the day and push
people down the stairs

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,179
so my name is Andrew hey if you saw me
speak yesterday you're gonna hear a lot

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,300
of the same jokes because i have a very
small repertoire

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,070
I give you a little bit of an idea about
me

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,240
I am the chief information security
officer data gravity been there since

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,659
January before that i was the director
research & opendns which is why if you

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,460
were in taxes talk she kept looking at
me and I would do this or do this when

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,180
some of the things you're talking about
for dns so I built that team really fun

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,120
I was the chief evangelist and director
of research at cloud passage for a while

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,089
i was also a dirty industry analyst for
a number of years i worked as a

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,090
practitioner doing a lot of incident
response forensics and general

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,670
information security office type stuff
at the University of Lethbridge in

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,369
western canada i'm sure you've never
heard of it but an hour north of the

14
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,360
Montana border

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,430
so really the middle of nowhere i also
work in the information security office

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,390
for a bank in Bermuda I'm not gonna tell
you which one but there's only three

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,009
so no one in three shot it sounds a lot
cooler than it actually was

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,810
i also work to queue on labs which is
now IBM i think i was employee 34 or

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,930
something and I've written a whole bunch
of books that looking at my statements

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,270
none of you read

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm assuming you all were in that
session yesterday because none of you

22
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,289
laughs that I blog sometimes I spent a
lot of time on planes going from

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,680
conference to conference I think this is
my my 18 or 20 of conference this year

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,170
and I still got as many the fill out the
rest of the year which my wife is very

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,320
happy about

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,350
so what we're going to talk about

27
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,080
so first why me I i I've managed
engineers I've managed researchers

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,590
security analysts whole bunch of
different companies

29
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:16,000
I am a self-taught data scientists in
that I have no scientific background and

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,860
our Ruby and Python hacker and I use the
term hacker with the air quotes because

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,870
I'm not a hacker in the sense of I
really understand these languages and

32
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,010
rip them apart

33
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,609
I just kind of piecemeal things together
until they do work

34
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,360
they look pretty horrible if you go to
my get repo you look at that and say wow

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,100
how this is even work because i'm
generally as surprised that it works is

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,840
you might be so I some of the research

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm kind of known for which isn't that
great a thing I do a lot of the initial

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,950
research on the IOT hello Barbie

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,060
I actually had someone come up to me at
RSA like hey you're that you're the

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,049
hello Barbie guy which is you know
that's what you want to be known as

41
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,260
though you're that techno

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:12,399
you're the guy that hack the car now you
have hello Barbie read a whole bunch of

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,140
bogus website research presented on a
lot of graph theory and malware analysis

44
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,429
at black hat been fun so I've been a
practitioner advantage

45
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,480
men's teams of researchers I've also
hired a lot of people that are new to

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,720
the research game either right from
academia or from the security just side

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,000
of the planet and these are a lot of
tips and tricks and methodologies that

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,290
I've developed to help people start a
research project because that's probably

49
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,090
the number one thing that I'm asked is
what do I research and this is from

50
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,060
employees who have hired to be
researchers like dude you're the

51
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,140
researcher you tell me what you want to
research uh stuff on the internet

52
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,610
malware

53
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:04,300
like that's a broad category I don't
even say that's a category so i use this

54
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,500
model not to insult anyone but just to
really put in your head the different

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,108
types of research that is out there and
i use this a little bit

56
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,740
this is this is much better so there is
pure knowledge type of research where

57
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,600
you're doing it for the spirit

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
this is highly academic not very
applicable

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,469
whereas bottom right-hand you

60
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:40,570
thomas edison has a ton of patents has
built a ton of physical devices and I

61
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,340
put d-von here as well because so if
anyone does no divas

62
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,859
he does a lot of lock-picking has
written a couple books and if he builds

63
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,000
tools

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,980
it's not to make the locks and the lock
company is better but rather to show how

65
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,910
to exploit it in a quick and dirty
fashion so it's not for the betterment

66
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,080
of humanity

67
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,740
it's for tackling a particular objective

68
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,530
so I would say that the hybrid of this
is the user inspired base basic research

69
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,869
and that's where i put Charlie and and
Chris in for the car hacking stuff

70
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,290
because it wasn't hey we're going to do
some really cool stuff and that's it

71
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,590
it's we're going to do some stuff to
raise awareness and hopefully change the

72
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,650
way people develop and implement
technology and cars and I'd say they've

73
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:41,590
got a pretty good job of that so I use
this is a a graphic for if you look up

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,270
what a data scientist is these on the
Left I know it's kind of hard to read

75
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,659
but under math and statistics

76
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,210
we've got things like machine learning
statistical modeling experiment design

77
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,090
vision inference

78
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,669
if you're a math or science nerd you may
say oh yeah that's me that's totally me

79
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,440
I am crap math so that is not me domain
knowledge and soft skills

80
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:15,210
this is where I shine where I have the
knowledge of the attacker of threat of

81
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,010
the device and I can communicate in
either a written fashion or presentation

82
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,070
and or online

83
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,360
you know just some sort of publication
programming in database already told you

84
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm a crap programmer but definitely key
components if you want to do some

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,719
research

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,770
now i will say that you may not have all
of these it's probably safe that is

87
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,770
anyone here not have any of these by the
way

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,120
yeah so someone that they don't have all
four

89
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,180
oh no one's arrogant 201 is there get to
say that he has all four

90
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,680
good for you serve communication and
visualization

91
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,250
that's another one that's very important
how to communicate your your findings to

92
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:09,240
someone who or some ones who don't
really care about the yield the numbers

93
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,620
and the knobs and the degree of twist in
the knob to get a certain result they

94
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,320
want to see the pretty pictures they
want to see the findings they want to

95
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,849
see what made it tick where they want to
see the sausage without seeing how it

96
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:21,780
was made

97
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,369
which you know it's an important skill i
will say that info graphics are kind of

98
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,530
like the knock-knock joke

99
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,349
infographics are similar to knock knock
jokes and that the lowest form of

100
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,469
communication for a joke

101
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,010
infographics definitely fall into that
category they're very marketing

102
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,360
they're good at very big picture stuff
but not you know succinct information

103
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,550
so this is for a data scientist when i
add when I looked at this I said okay

104
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,949
there's a few things that are missing
for a security researcher and that's

105
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:07,699
curiosity event action-driven so if you
work for an organization as a security

106
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:14,060
researcher you will get things pop up
like the release of hell over be like

107
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,500
hey that thing

108
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,590
connect to the internet I need to
research that that's an event-driven so

109
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,989
product release drove us to research
that I go to market time sensitivity

110
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:30,198
if you're competing with fellow
researchers at different firms or just

111
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,060
in general in the community

112
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,228
there is an artificial timeline imposed
you need to be the first so it's it's

113
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,550
the old Ricky Bobby thing

114
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,789
you're the first you're last and then

115
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,649
security researchers tend to have a need
to do good or bad

116
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,060
I won't be arrogant enough to say that
all security research is performed by

117
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:58,489
people that are good bad guys and girls
do research as well the difference is

118
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,880
that from what I've seen is that the
need to do good to the researchers that

119
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,529
are doing good are trying to release
something for you to the betterment of

120
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,570
society or the betterment of their
company they're standing within the

121
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,990
community out where the bad guys

122
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,810
it's more of a means to an end and
you're not going to get people posting

123
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,709
you know

124
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,859
Oh days before they've ever been used
like you know I want to share this with

125
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,510
the community because I'm a bad guy

126
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,800
this is what I used to crack into these
banks now you can to that you're not

127
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,609
going to see that unless it's much
farther down low road and they've lost

128
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,880
all utility for that exploit

129
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,800
now some of the pros and cons now you
might say okay I still don't know what

130
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,029
the research and ER

131
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,699
we're getting there there's types of
research

132
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:55,899
and pros and cons to each so if you do
net new research

133
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,709
you have full control over the
experiment you get to define the

134
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,069
parameters because it's you know it's
your baby

135
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:08,350
you also have the potential to be first
if no one else is researching this which

136
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,769
it does happen sometimes you're
researching something that no one else

137
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:16,419
is thought to research the cons though
it's very time consuming because you're

138
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,239
starting everything from scratch from
the ground up

139
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:24,220
there's also that time sensitivity and
time is a big factor in all of these

140
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,989
more so in brand new research because
the longer it takes you to complete your

141
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:33,790
research the more likely that someone
else is going to pick up research in

142
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,669
parallel in direct competition with you

143
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:42,189
continued research is actually kind of
fun because someone else has done a lot

144
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,839
of the legwork for you

145
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,499
so that's that's very positive so they
may have data sets already generated

146
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:54,999
they have theories that i may have been
posed but were never actually executed

147
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:59,769
or carried through the research cycle
which you can pick up and now you have a

148
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,220
little piece of this research that can
be your claim to fame or where or your

149
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:11,859
contribution to this ongoing research
the downsides of continued research has

150
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:15,039
anyone so who here does research in some
capacity

151
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,970
all right who here that does research
has ever tried to pick up someone else's

152
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,910
research and they will not give you any
information

153
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,179
yeah oh well you know these are my
findings

154
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:32,919
you can have them you know this this is
IP

155
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,480
this is proprietary to my university or
to my company that makes it very hard to

156
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,629
pick off where someone else left off
because really you're continuing that

157
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:48,339
research using a lot of assumptions

158
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,679
if they weren't outline specifically in
the research paper or the way it was

159
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,619
communicated so you're you're doing a
lot of guesswork

160
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:00,879
so that way that person can challenge
your findings or anyone can challenge

161
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,460
your findings because you can't say one
to one that

162
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,020
at the data sets are identical because
you don't have what the other person

163
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,020
used challenging research

164
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,189
this does not mean calling someone out
on Twitter a lot of people think that's

165
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,510
how you challenge research by pointing
and saying that's stupid or that's wrong

166
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,720
that's really so don't do that

167
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,180
stop doing that what would your mother
think the benefit though is if you

168
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,969
challenge someone's research the time
constraint isn't a sensitive so time is

169
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,880
not as sensitive and you can really take
your time to prove or disprove the

170
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,870
findings

171
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:52,700
the cons however it can be very time
consuming and a time-consuming piece of

172
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,920
this is if you point at someone and say
your findings are stupid and you're an

173
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,729
idiot

174
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,910
hey by the way can you share that data
with me so I can disprove what you found

175
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,270
they are probably not going to help you
make them look even more stupid than you

176
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,579
already think they're so you approach it
with kid gloves if you want to challenge

177
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,800
someone's research the cons

178
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,550
you know it could you could validate
their findings you may have spent a

179
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,990
whole bunch of time trying to disprove
the findings only to come to the exact

180
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,240
same conclusions which is good for the
other person not so good for you you're

181
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
not really seeing anything new

182
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,760
no new findings I know challenging
thoughts

183
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,340
it's hard to really do a presentation
say here is everything that I didn't

184
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,050
find wrong with this

185
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,380
this research on this exploit or on this
tool

186
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,830
no one cares they want to find out what
you found was wrong or what was new

187
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,820
not that everything's cool what we're
going to do for the next fifty eight

188
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,390
minutes

189
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,250
any questions like that's

190
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,310
that's boring that's not talking you're
gonna want to go to so not everyone

191
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:14,359
should be a researcher and you should
always use these three questions to

192
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,730
decide if you should research something

193
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,230
the first one being what's the question
you're trying to answer in the case of

194
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:28,940
the hello Barbie stuff myself and andrew
blades which was really confusing for

195
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,400
the media because our first names are
both Andrew we wanted to know how

196
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:41,510
vulnerable or how insecure or how how

197
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,570
privacy can be exploited by using hello
Barbie because it's connected to the

198
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,790
internet and we had concerns neither of
us have kids but we had concerns that

199
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,849
someone could eavesdrop on
communications could use the Barbie use

200
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,500
barbie for bad things

201
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,300
so did we have do you have the data into
answer the question in the case of hello

202
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,079
Barbie

203
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,880
I spent two to three hours surfing the
internet looking for Barbie related

204
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,470
information which as I said I don't have
kids so if someone was looking at those

205
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,470
proxy logs

206
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,960
I probably look like a predator but I
swear it was for research

207
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,180
if you're going to research something
like hello Barbie don't like then start

208
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,239
saying windowless vans or bulk candy
orders

209
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,579
you don't want to stitch together that
timeline for someone to look at

210
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,630
or maybe you do maybe that's your
research so three

211
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,180
so do you have the data answer the
question yes we bought the device and we

212
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,180
could generate the data we needed to
conduct the research

213
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,800
so if you could answer the question
could you use the answer

214
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,910
so could you use the answer could
society use the answer could the vendor

215
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,130
that release the product use the answer

216
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,070
that's the you in that

217
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,380
so in our case if we can answer the
question could we use the answer

218
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,030
yes we can responsibly disclosed to the
vendor which we did we could let the

219
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,970
media know about the challenges and the
issues around these fast releasing IOT

220
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,690
devices specifically for children as
we're leading up to the holidays you

221
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,720
know these are things that we want to
make known

222
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,130
now i won't go through all of these
slides will be posted

223
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:39,130
so there's a number of questions or
types of questions that you can ask when

224
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:45,100
we're doing security research the most
common are the exploratory and

225
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,880
inferential so exploratory I've got a
data set

226
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,740
I'm going to see what i can find in this
data set up versus inferential is that I

227
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:03,310
believe that that communications between
point A and point B are insecure

228
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,860
based on the company's past track record
so you're inferring a result before or

229
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,899
you're really asking a question of the
target of your research

230
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,689
the others are very loosey-goosey ignore
those ones

231
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,280
so now how do we analyze the data

232
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,920
so this is a continuous motion so you
have to first set the expectations of

233
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,390
all right

234
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,460
i believe so this isn't really how the
research . but so I believe that hello

235
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:46,060
Barbie communicates to the server hosted
in amazon using insecure protocols which

236
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:53,919
it hit but let's just say you know
doesn't use ssl collect data

237
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,020
communications between the app in
between barbie and the internet we see

238
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,620
that

239
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,570
hey you know what it does use ssl it may
be a vulnerable vulnerable cipher

240
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,810
strength for sweet but you know that
kind of challenges our first question so

241
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,710
if you go to the next one we need to
revise the expectations and feed it back

242
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,950
into the expectation setting phase

243
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:24,900
ok even though it does use ssl does it
use insecure cipher suites and then we

244
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,120
just keep going until we can really form
a hypothesis for our research

245
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:39,120
I'll tell you there's nothing worse than
posing a very broad of a question and

246
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,620
then get into the end of your research
and finding I got crap that wasn't good

247
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,280
that was that was a good research
project at all because I you know

248
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,690
there's too many different ways i could
take it and I didn't refine it down as

249
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,940
much as I could

250
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,990
so if you are going to perform research

251
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,040
you should have a question because if
you don't have a question about

252
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,540
something then you're not

253
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,540
why research something you should have a
curiosity

254
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:15,389
so if you are not curious how a device
works or how an application works or how

255
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,340
the target of your research is
interesting or how it operates

256
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,620
you're probably not going to have much
of a personal attachment to your

257
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,649
research and if you don't have an
attachment to your research

258
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,220
that's kind of like someone giving you a
whole bunch of homework and say hey you

259
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,400
know what I know you don't care about
this but you should do this

260
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,150
you know i'm not going to do that means
nothing to me i don't care

261
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,590
so it will just drag on now time time

262
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,990
how many people here are married that's
a lot of people so you have how many

263
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,000
people have kids so you have ample time
to do whatever you want

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,070
lots of free time for research my advice
to you so I have two dogs and I married

265
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:07,110
not to the dogs to a wife but time
became a challenge but you know how I

266
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,179
carved out time and this is how I
suggest you do it is find a television

267
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,300
show that your significant other loves
that you cannot stand for me dancing

268
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,200
with the stars

269
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I would rather shove

270
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,940
so many Forks in my eye then sit there
and watch Dancing with the Stars

271
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:33,570
on the plus side it gives me an hour to
two hours a week to do research in that

272
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,379
time over the years I've learned python
I've learned groovy I've learned our

273
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,259
I've learned data science I did

274
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,159
hello Barbie research i've done a whole
bunch of other research I've built tools

275
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,409
you know thank you dancing with the
stars for giving me research time with

276
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:50,940
your stupid show

277
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,179
so find a show that you hate

278
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
bachelors probably another good one

279
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,129
my wife doesn't watch that but if she
did I you know I gained more hours a

280
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:02,998
week

281
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:06,929
the ability to execute this is key

282
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,999
you can have a an awesome idea for a
research project but if you have neither

283
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:19,409
the time the curiosity or the technical
skills to execute on that research that

284
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:24,899
becomes a challenge so I forced myself
to learn Ruby r and python because i

285
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:29,610
needed to create tools that weren't
there and analyze the data in a

286
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,490
repeatable fashion up

287
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,889
I'm a very bad programmer no I wouldn't
consider myself a programmer i am far

288
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:38,309
better

289
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,509
foosball which I would say that I
majored in college before I dropped out

290
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:49,799
because i couldn't envision myself
sitting was behind a keyboard coding for

291
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,639
the rest of my life

292
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:55,740
that just wasn't me and look at me now
so I dropped out and they want to do

293
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,340
that anymore

294
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,929
well

295
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,250
but some of the different areas of
research in the next few slides but you

296
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,500
need to be able to execute on one or
some or all of the different areas in

297
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,380
order to provide some sort of research

298
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,820
maybe you're great at graphics so I
realized that that's not something that

299
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,730
i expressly outlined in the areas to
execute

300
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,630
but the ability to communicate your
research is fantastic

301
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,100
you know that's not a skill that
everyone has as was a good example when

302
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,409
she was up here presenting she was
presenting things that her team did but

303
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,890
the shared collect she is the ability to
present it to people

304
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,150
granted she does her own research and is
focused hyper focus on some of her own

305
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,140
things but the ability to present
someone else's research that's a skill

306
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,720
that not a lot of people have and then
the last one is the asset device

307
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,670
software i usually just group this into
a said or device

308
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,420
so you're going to research software
have the software going to research a

309
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,020
device by the device or borrow the
device will get to that in a little bit

310
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:13,330
here - so device acquisition or asset
acquisition you can fork out money and

311
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,149
buy something electronic software toys

312
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,420
you can borrow it from work from a
friend from a neighbor

313
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,050
you can quote unquote rent it and return
it from electronic store red Center

314
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,149
did you guys have rent-a-center up here
they have a lot of stuff that you can

315
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,410
just rent for a week

316
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,860
do some research and return it no
questions asked

317
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,350
you can download for any software you
can get trial bm's if it's a SAS

318
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,679
application is going to be there any way
you can get a 30-day 90 day trial

319
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,520
poke and prod that a bit so much these
are some of my favorite places to rent

320
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,430
equipment and software costco I love
going to costco

321
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,310
I just hate waiting in line at costco
but they have a full refund policy on

322
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,389
everything

323
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,320
you know it can be on fire and melted as
you bring it back to them and they'll be

324
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,090
like yeah well we'll give you credit for

325
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,980
we can exchange it so you have to return
it within 90 days and this includes

326
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,680
televisions projectors computers cameras
camcorders tablets iPods mp3 players

327
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,980
which we all buy a lot of these days and
cell phones

328
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,270
I assume that means the the
pay-as-you-go phones not the ones from

329
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,879
the long-term plans target

330
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,390
another good one if it's a target
branded item

331
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:40,180
you know what if you can't think of a
research project do research just on

332
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,590
target branded items that they reseller
they package because you can return it

333
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,120
up to a year later

334
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:53,229
even its unpackaged and opened a new
conditions so non-target stuff 90 days

335
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,070
no-contract cell phones computers
cameras gaming systems 30 days

336
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,750
music movies video games because
everyone responsibly purchases them and

337
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,990
doesn't download illegally from the
internet that have not been opened

338
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,940
can't be returned but you can exchange
it so if you want to focus on the latest

339
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:17,140
greatest games or software or you know
some of the software that's embedded in

340
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,660
dvds and blu-rays you have a continuous
loop you're just like yeah man all I

341
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,190
don't like this I'm gonna return it

342
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,040
I didn't like this one either a
miniature return it eventually someone's

343
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,879
going to catch on but then you just
moved to a different store until you get

344
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,200
onto a list and then you start borrowing
or enlisting your friends

345
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,820
I had my researchers at opendns buy
stuff online so that it didn't look like

346
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,770
I was courting a whole bunch of stuff
because the last thing I want it is ok

347
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,139
let's do research on

348
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,460
on pressure cookers no no we probably
shouldn't do that and i'm not going to

349
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,810
buy 10 of them from one site at one time
that's and fertilizer going to hold a

350
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:01,840
fertilizer to fry's i don't know if you
guys have fries here but if you're in

351
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,970
vegas go to frys

352
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,330
we've got a bunch of them on the west
coast and for some of these ghosts - but

353
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,949
I'm like a kid in a candy store walking
through there every piece of electronics

354
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:20,110
making building destroying equipment
plus they've got a huge absolutely huge

355
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,060
I'll that's filled with connected toys

356
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,810
I like kids toys so one day my wife

357
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,070
I told her that I'm gonna go to frys
just pick up some stuff for research and

358
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm like dancing down the aisle with a
cart and picking all these toys again if

359
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,810
I went out into windows van someone
would call the cops

360
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:47,139
but I I had all these things that I
could test and then return and there's a

361
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,660
lot of obscure stuff that you can't get
at costco or best buy or anything like

362
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,770
that like a lot of knockoff Chinese
brands that no one's heard of that are

363
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,320
just resold a repackaged oh all right

364
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,540
Oh test that and then return it so two
hundred fifty dollars later i add a

365
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,720
whole bunch of stuff to test a whole
bunch of webcams that no one's ever

366
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,650
heard of best buy they have a lot of
really good new products especially when

367
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,800
it comes to you know physical pieces of
technology

368
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:29,470
I i would advise that you don't try and
you know rent a television before a big

369
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,860
sporting event they it's not great

370
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,030
they will typically pushy like if you're
going to get a whole bunch of stuff on

371
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,580
Christmas break and research it

372
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,840
they're gonna force you to return it
either before Christmas early weeks

373
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,050
after Christmas just because they can't
keep up with the demand

374
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:54,520
so now now that you know how to research
some of the core research ideas

375
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,100
so this is based so I say difficulty
based on my experience because i told

376
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:07,449
you before not a developer but I'm very
strong at networking because i started

377
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,600
doing networking dialogue tech support

378
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,719
yeah so just if you don't have a lot of
knowledge on how to research something

379
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,910
or how to develop your own tools

380
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,260
it's very easy to learn how to use
wireshark little bit of a steeper

381
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,360
learning curve for t see Dom or some of
the other packet capture tools but if

382
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,929
you plug in the device start sniffing
the traffic you can reconstruct the

383
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,550
communication session and you have a
better knowledge of how this device is

384
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,860
communicating with the internet or the
in cloud provider hosting provider and i

385
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,969
would advise you to plug something in
snip the traffic and then configure it

386
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,880
to see what changes see what advertising
sites it calls home to like was at

387
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,770
hockey app and a whole bunch of other
statistical information is anyone here

388
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,139
have a samsung smart TV at home

389
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:08,320
to connect to the internet probably yeah

390
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,370
so if you look at the traffic that some
research that we did when i was at Open

391
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:19,479
DNS is it calls home to Korea using a
piece of software that is no longer

392
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,080
supported and shouldn't be in the
product anymore but it's okay it

393
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,169
separates the good Korea so everyone can
relax

394
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:32,620
but it's analytics that you know the the
samsung smart tvs get put in offices all

395
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,370
the time you know you don't have
overhead projectors anymore you have TVs

396
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,679
then some idiot can say hey this thing

397
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:45,940
connect the internet we should connect
this to the Internet I digress software

398
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,309
he is

399
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:52,590
you can download the software associated
software with the toy with whatever

400
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,678
maybe it's a standalone application you
just want to reverse it and pick it

401
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,850
apart

402
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,809
you should also think about the UI UX
back in software that's required the

403
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:09,840
communication channels from maybe it's
running a sequel database or looks the

404
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,340
small sequel database

405
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,120
thank you sequel light database a lot of
tools use that a lot of mobile devices

406
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,209
will read to a sequel database on the
phone

407
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,690
so if you're installing apps going to
want to include that in your research

408
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:27,269
their scope the platform itself if you
want to do research on the operating

409
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:31,019
system or the cloud provider that is
running on

410
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,928
that's another area of research I split
out the hardware in the circuitry and i

411
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:42,360
differentiate them in this way you can
research the hardware without really

412
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,820
knowing how it was architected using
schematics

413
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,009
so the difference is hardware you can
say okay it has USB ports

414
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:57,570
that's cool it's you know I don't know
where the you are is I don't know where

415
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,740
any of this stuff is but I know what
this thing looks like when I rip it

416
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,590
apart you can document accordingly you
can start for the circuitry so from the

417
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,549
hardware side if you can look at serial
numbers of various devices and

418
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:18,779
components google probably all coming
from the same warehouse or distributor

419
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:23,460
somewhere in China South East Asia
somewhere that you've got a lot number

420
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,539
in a bit i'm burning and say okay this
is what this is used for now the

421
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,679
circuitry

422
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,740
they are taking electrical engineering
courses or like they were they were fun

423
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,799
now you can do a lot if you understand

424
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:44,190
let's say you find a kid's toy that has
a

425
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,950
resistor that isn't sufficient for
what's going through it

426
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,429
maybe this thing catches on fire maybe
that's some research that the vendor

427
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,270
should know about before they release it
to the general public or the general

428
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,030
public should know that before buying it
for their kid

429
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:06,070
so it doesn't burn their faces off or or
not you know your call

430
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,450
so these are so

431
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,159
questions from a network level where
does it call 02 is the data encrypted

432
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,919
software does it have any flaws tamper
protection is plain text data available

433
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,260
usually it is the platform you know is
it hosted in a way that i can circumvent

434
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:34,279
how it communicates or how it operates
based on the actual end . hardware is it

435
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,630
useful information

436
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,130
if I direct connect to some of the i/o
and then circuitry you known or unknown

437
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,100
issues with specific components

438
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:50,120
that's another cool thing is if you find
something that has a recall because of a

439
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,139
problem

440
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:54,918
that's you know that's a shortcut to
publish research right there

441
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:01,220
ok these devices which are now sold in
bulk to this particular manufacturer and

442
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,330
is included in this line of devices that
they're aiming at children

443
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,330
these could cause physical harm

444
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:17,539
we should do something about that i
often think and this is just arbitrary

445
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,990
in my mind that a research team

446
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:26,840
ideally should be made up of three
people it can be more it can be less but

447
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,389
I find that it's usually easier with
three specifically with these areas of

448
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:33,408
expertise

449
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:36,980
hardware expertise network expertise and
software expertise

450
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,990
usually what happens when you're doing
research though is you may have someone

451
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,639
that spans hardware network expertise
and someone just software or even more

452
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:47,510
common

453
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,279
you're researching something on your own
and no one has hardware expertise or no

454
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:58,130
one has software expertise that doesn't
mean that you shouldn't research that

455
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:04,490
just means that you don't have to ask
questions or pose a hypothesis as it

456
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,000
relates to an area that you don't
understand

457
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,969
and a great example is if you make do
with what you have

458
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,500
this allows someone else to pick up the
slack so if you ask your friends

459
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,679
colleagues the internet

460
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,920
someone help me with this research
nobody jumps on and how

461
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,440
whew you just document in your research
that you know i am only going to

462
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,179
research the networking software
capabilities of a particular device or

463
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,370
of a product suite

464
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,489
not the hardware and let someone else
pick it up down the road and you can

465
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,959
invite people say here's the data I have
thus far I haven't looked at the

466
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,100
hardware because i don't have that
knowledge if you want to do that you can

467
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,139
run your own research you can help me
contribute to mine or we can really

468
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,159
something together

469
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:05,629
it's great now these are just very quick
ideas of the types of labs that you can

470
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,770
set up and these are things that you
don't don't think that when i was an

471
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,750
open dns I this huge lab a lot of these
were like stitch together on a ping-pong

472
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,590
table that was by my lab work station

473
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:24,290
so if you're looking at software you
probably want to look at the security of

474
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,590
the site you're downloading from is
that's acceptable

475
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:33,560
can someone poison that site and will
replace it with a new executable that is

476
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,850
required to download is their firmware
for particular device that you should

477
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,779
analyze you should analyze the device
itself if it's an IOT device

478
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,190
you should look at the mobile app device
if there's a mobile component you can

479
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:51,890
look at the platform that it's running
on the mobile firmware of the device and

480
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,190
then you're probably gonna have an
analysis station where you're taking all

481
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:01,670
of your data and centrally analyzing it
and aggregating and doing your research

482
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,640
for god sakes back it up

483
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,370
networking this is typically what i do
is i set up an external router on

484
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:15,799
internal router and then in the middle
you know how hard it is to find a 10100

485
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,610
hub brand new right now it's really hard
because everything is a smart desktops

486
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:27,740
which now so if you don't have a hub and
you know looking at the age of some

487
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,830
people in this room I would assume that
there's at least one hub sitting in a

488
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,450
box somewhere in the basement

489
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:39,379
I get a a switch with the ability to
have a span or me report so you can

490
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,170
watch the traffic or get a network tap

491
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,160
I will warn you though that if you don't
get a regenerative network tap

492
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,549
you're only going to see one side of the
communication so you may see internal

493
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:57,020
only or external only regenerative tap
you can see both ways but really it's

494
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:03,410
cheaper just to get a switch that has a
span port and start taking your peak

495
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,759
apps your log your header information
and store that offline because that's

496
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,170
part of the network knowledge that you
really want to bring in your research

497
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,230
yeah this is think so

498
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,220
ok that was networking pairing that's an
extra slide

499
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,140
I always think of a bi-directional
communication not only what you're

500
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:32,690
sending to it but what it's sending back
to you and also look at the cloud

501
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:39,319
hosting infrastructure so you will
notice any device or software may phone

502
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:43,880
home to multiple places you want to note
that in your research because it could

503
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,319
be that one of those hosting
infrastructure's or platform is the weak

504
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:54,800
link in the chain that could be
exploited or calling home to South Korea

505
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,839
software so again you're probably have a
analysis station

506
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,819
you can look at the code for the UI API
open vulnerable ports

507
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:12,950
you name it and the cloud infrastructure
itself the UI the API any ports that may

508
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,810
be open or services that are running on
that cloud provider that could introduce

509
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:24,290
additional security vulnerabilities or
methods to tamper hardware

510
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:29,359
again this is an area not my personal
expertise to take a whole bunch of

511
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,109
electronics in school but again I was
much better foosball

512
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,099
but keep in mind the device firmware the
mobile app device firmware operating

513
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:43,220
system and then the inner workings of
each

514
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:50,450
very important if you want to go the
hardware out and here is just some

515
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,368
suggested lab equipment

516
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:56,450
you don't take a picture of this i'm
going to be publishing the slides ah but

517
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,180
if you look here from the hardware side

518
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:07,819
I've got a link here for this is Mudge's
list of tools for hardware hacking from

519
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,099
2014 a black hat

520
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:14,030
great set of slides tells you you know
what type of oscilloscope

521
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,920
what other hardware you might need in
order to perform hardware hacking or

522
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,920
hardware research great resource

523
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,960
oh and also from the software side of
things safe assumption that software

524
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,820
companies probably have run at least a
battery of buzzing tests against their

525
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,810
software

526
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,810
it won't be extensive so if you've got
the time

527
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:47,779
there's no time constraints start
buzzing the crap out of the application

528
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:54,530
or the the device because you may find
something very interesting that they

529
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,589
missed because of their own time
constraints of getting stuff to market

530
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:07,490
this is probably one of the biggest
questions that most people don't know

531
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,319
they need to answer any academics in the
audience

532
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,490
so what

533
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,479
so tenure how awesome is tenure it's

534
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,959
if you had tenure how awesome would tend
your be got here

535
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:33,310
yeah you're great things so at openvms
we had people that came from academia

536
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:38,049
and when you ask them when research
would be completed or when do you think

537
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,890
this will be you know this subsection
will be done

538
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:49,930
the answer was generally when it's done
you have to realize that in most

539
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,299
companies if you're doing research for
that company

540
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,710
you don't have that ability just to say
it will be done when it's done

541
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,460
they're artificial time constraints
which we'll talk about in a little bit

542
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,030
I that are imposed upon you that you
have no control over

543
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,260
so you have to set your expectations and
your research agenda accordingly

544
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,180
so these are four areas that I've
defined that I communicate to people

545
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,629
that this is when you can stop or when
you know it's time to stop

546
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:23,349
so the time constraint so it there are
sometimes marketing constraints so at

547
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:27,760
opendns we had a blog Kings where
everyone on the team would rotate

548
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,839
through

549
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:33,400
at first it was everyone does one blog
post a month as we grew the team it

550
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,050
you know is once every month and a half
but if you wanted to talk about

551
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,500
something that someone like a fellow
researcher cared about there would be

552
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,580
some research

553
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,359
so you wouldn't do a grand one year
research project you would do a very

554
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:53,140
short research project to support the
publication that's not saying it would

555
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,250
have been more valuable to do a
year-long maybe but is their immediate

556
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,770
value to the company that is paying you
in doing a short one to drive people to

557
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,500
get other researchers excited and what
you're doing

558
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,630
yeah I'd say there's definitely value in
that diminished relevancy

559
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,920
maybe what you are researching gets
research by someone else and they

560
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,130
published their findings the head of
yours and you read through their

561
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,900
findings and you realize oh they covered
absolutely everything i was going to

562
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,680
cover

563
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,999
crap

564
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:32,808
should I keep researching well probably
not unless you can find a market

565
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:37,489
difference between the way they research
something or or your hypothesis

566
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:42,829
different researching after someone has
researched it and published your

567
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:47,029
expected conclusions is kind of a waste
of time

568
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:50,839
I would move on to something else that's
my advice

569
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:56,449
so also success and failure success yay
everything's great

570
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:02,209
I can publish my research failure i
disprove disprove my hypothesis

571
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:05,509
so does anyone know is failure and
research a bad thing

572
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:09,619
why why is failure not a bad thing

573
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:15,619
I prizes you do learn something

574
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:21,529
anyone else

575
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:36,319
30 and that my back's are this is as far
as I'm gonna walk so failure so

576
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,449
successful i was success a little bit

577
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,799
first there so it's a crucial part of a
research project it's great and you know

578
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:46,369
that you have hit success

579
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:50,779
you hit pay dirt if you created new
knowledge that was not it there before

580
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:57,109
someone has made a decision or policy or
something has happened as a direct

581
00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:00,949
result of your published research report
presentation

582
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:08,598
whatever infographic you know how i feel
that info graphics up and you know

583
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,579
sometimes you can mark success by saying
i don't have the data i needed to really

584
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:18,409
get my question answered that successful

585
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:21,409
you know you you came up with some
solutions it may have created new

586
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,469
knowledge that you didn't have before
but you can always go back and edit that

587
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,789
later or we run it

588
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:32,609
so in terms of failure not everything is
successful no matter what your mother

589
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:39,779
told you but never look at it as failure
a negative outcome just means that you

590
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:48,329
either didn't ask the right question or
that your hypothesis was flawed in some

591
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:49,380
way

592
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,099
so by saying that you know I believe
that clear text communication occurred

593
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:01,319
between Barbie and a particular cloud
provider if I went through with that

594
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,799
entire hypothesis and I came to the end
and said nope uses ssl

595
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:08,729
hi well so that's that's a negative

596
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,489
that's a failed research project but now
I know so i have created new knowledge

597
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:21,539
for myself that I can then in turn we
run through the research loop so some of

598
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,429
the negative outcomes

599
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:28,289
someone will make decisions that
disregard evidence

600
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:35,039
you can probably look at any Fox News
pie chart equivocal results that don't

601
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,609
shed light in one direction or the other
so you just you can't come to a final

602
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:39,630
conclusion

603
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,130
you know it's huge gray area uncertainty
prevents new knowledge

604
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,909
so you're not sure you don't want to go
on a limb and say you know conclusively

605
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:51,989
i have found that this is the results

606
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:58,499
maybe I think you know no one's going to
really believe you or trust you now

607
00:45:58,499 --> 00:46:00,479
presenting your research

608
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:12,390
this is a pipeline model that i
liberated from Roger ping at school yet

609
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,210
let's forget this John

610
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:22,780
options at Johns Hopkins so this is the
way he thinks of the research pipeline

611
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,790
so you have the data you created code
you've got the analytical data you have

612
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,700
some analytics code and you have the
results

613
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,000
now i need to present it in some way
shape or form

614
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,589
so now we're going to talk about is this
part of the presentation side of things

615
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:45,368
it will make you famous or infamous so
some of the ways that you can publish

616
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,180
research and don't think that everything
has to be an academic paper a lot of

617
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,098
academics that come out of school

618
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,790
they've had it drilled into them through
their masters or PhD program that

619
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,359
everything has to be a long boring paper
with all the facts figures

620
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:04,990
sometimes it can be just a short blog
post with you no more information to be

621
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,580
released at a later time

622
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,270
so blogs very effective way lot of bang
for the buck

623
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:15,160
a lot of people see those articles if
you're publishing your findings in a

624
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,040
journal of your peers

625
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:25,839
you're getting exclusive access to peers
who can validate your findings and

626
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,049
recreate your findings but you're really
limiting the scope

627
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:34,060
so you know the story that was for
papers

628
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,589
no articles when I talk about articles
i'm thinking of trade publications like

629
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:43,450
dark reading or some of the other trade
pubs out there that will publish a

630
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,500
lengthy article based on someone's
research you can get a lot of face time

631
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,230
and publication value by giving a a
reporter and exclusive on your research

632
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:58,660
they eat that up because they want to be
the first to really something i don't

633
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,868
send it to krebs because he gets these
all the time he's not going to have the

634
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:06,910
time to send it to you or to to dedicate
to take your research and publish it

635
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,509
so find some of the lesser known or
maybe not

636
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,369
some of the top tier reporters go there
is a hell give you an exclusive on this

637
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:19,450
if you want to cover it mentioned me
prominently they'll be like oh yeah yeah

638
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,529
I'll totally do that

639
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,680
so academic paper again

640
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,069
I'm not an academic there is there's a
lot of outlets

641
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:32,720
the challenge i see with academic papers
is generally if it's not part of the

642
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,169
pure community that has access to this
information already someone would have

643
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,560
to pay to get access and that for me
that's a deterrent

644
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,509
although there is a site in Russia that
publishes everyone's research papers i

645
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,830
always forget the name of it but you
didn't hear that from me

646
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:53,150
of course now it's on the internet so
white papers not very effective

647
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:59,000
marketing tool to take your information
and distill it so that executives or the

648
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,970
targeted purchaser of your
product/service information can consume

649
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,240
it and digested in a manner that they're
used to

650
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:14,900
I must get that got a non-academic so
visualizations

651
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:20,810
I'm a very visual person i love the
individualization I'm never good at

652
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,990
making them but there's a lot of tools
out there that can do it for you

653
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:31,640
so if you've never looked at raw if you
like d3 visualizations raw is awesome

654
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,560
because you can just upload a
spreadsheet or a CSE TSV file and then

655
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,230
do a lot of the data visualization that
you would probably have to go out of

656
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,820
your way to make in d3 they have a lot
of things that are above and beyond like

657
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:52,010
pie charts so there's alluvial diagrams
and heat maps and really great things

658
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,860
you can download it and include your
reports

659
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:00,530
tableau public is free and it also gives
you a way to publish your data very

660
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:06,590
easily with a couple clicks you can send
people to your your data open graffiti

661
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:12,950
so that's something that we built that
opendns which is a 3d how to explain it

662
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,118
it's a three dimensional immersive
network

663
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:24,499
semantic network graph that you can
actually hook up to oculus rift and the

664
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:25,788
leap motion

665
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:32,029
so now everyone can go back and justify
an expense for elite motion and Shey

666
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,450
oculus rift for research purposes

667
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,069
yeah you can fly through your date and
grab nodes and edges and everything is

668
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:44,240
really cool graphics so pictures

669
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,569
don't put pictures just for the sake of
pictures make sure they mean something

670
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:50,569
infographics they're good for big
picture items

671
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,759
I dealt with marketing people with their
every time I went to them with research

672
00:50:55,759 --> 00:51:00,289
for a story or anything like all we can
make a great infographic out of that

673
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,859
how about we make something more
substantial than an infographic that

674
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:04,910
everyone is going to say

675
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:10,249
yep that's an infographic next reporter
Tate infographics -

676
00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:15,859
by the way conference talks that uh you
could present a lot of your knowledge

677
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:22,189
it's stressful for some the advice if
anyone here not like talking in public

678
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:27,289
only two people

679
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:30,680
wow that's that's impressive so when
you're not like raising their hands to

680
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:37,279
questions from a podium and double that
so it's very stressful though the advice

681
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:42,019
I can give to you and this is what i
always give to my guys is people are

682
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:47,359
coming to see you talk if you present it
or if you think about it as

683
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,828
entertainment

684
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:53,509
it takes a lot of the shock out of it
and it takes a lot of the pressure off

685
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:54,589
of you

686
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:58,160
you can imagine people make it if you
want in the security community though

687
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,009
you probably don't want to imagine too
many of us naked

688
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:08,180
it's a lot of pasty whiteness that you
don't want to see you can see that but

689
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,950
if you're presenting and you have data
to back up your research always point to

690
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,890
the data press interviews

691
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:20,239
you know you need to really up level it
and make sure that they can understand

692
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,259
what you're communicating

693
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:25,860
another tip that if you're dealing with
press if you write for them

694
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,470
what you want to be written it's so much
easier for them to copy and paste that

695
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,549
you become an asset to them very quickly
because you've done a lot of the work

696
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:41,310
for them and always remember sound bites
and charts that's what reporters want

697
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:46,320
they want sound bites they want quips
and they want charts because they want

698
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,590
to beefs up their stories without having
to think too hard about it

699
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:55,710
if you're going to present your code
which I strongly encourage python are

700
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,770
Ruby use whatever you want it's your
code

701
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:05,130
pick a language that other people use so
don't use cobalt don't use fortran God

702
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,130
don't use fortran Jupiter notebook

703
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:13,530
if you want to present visual
step-by-step executions of your

704
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:18,270
information by all means use Jupiter
notebook it's great and you can release

705
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:24,390
the notebook so someone can go through
step by step and read create your your

706
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,279
research get hub

707
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,540
please upload your code somewhere i
don't care if you public publicly put it

708
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,020
on github or you put in a private repo
at some point you're going to want that

709
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,090
code to put it somewhere if you publish
code publicly if you're allowed to

710
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:45,300
publish your code it allows other people
to look at your research and potentially

711
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,860
recreated if you can publish your data
even better because of an argument comes

712
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,490
up and say oh your researches crap you
didn't do all this

713
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:57,689
I I did do that here's my code and
here's the data please

714
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:05,400
you don't prove me wrong usually the the
peanut gallery on Twitter will back off

715
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,560
at that point because I go

716
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,460
crap now i have to do work i'll move on
and yell at someone else and tell them

717
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,720
they're stupid

718
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,370
so this is a great quote that I i found
one time

719
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,819
so when you write code keep in mind that
you're collaborating with your future

720
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,510
self has anyone ever gone back and
looked at their code and thought what

721
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,100
the hell was I thinking

722
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,540
now who wrote this

723
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,540
what okay BMO I that was me huh

724
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,380
everything should have go to my opinion

725
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,200
so I know we're running out of time here
but defending your research is very

726
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,980
important and there are very good ways
to do it they're also very bad ways to

727
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,420
do it

728
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,520
so you will find your findings will be
challenged at some point

729
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,720
that's not a bad thing that means people
care if no one challenges your research

730
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,149
it probably wasn't that relevant in the
first place and it's probably arrogant

731
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,660
to think that every piece of research
you publish is actually absolutely

732
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,470
pristine and perfect because it probably
isn't

733
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:15,120
so your challengers you will have shit
disturber shitheads grand Stander's who

734
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,120
just wanna you know see the world burn

735
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,870
they may be friends colleagues peers
they could challenge it

736
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:27,930
so you have to defend accordingly

737
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,259
so always argue with your data and your
findings

738
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,350
this is why you publish your research
and you present it in a way that's

739
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:38,940
consumable if you can publish your code
great if you can publish the data along

740
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,630
with that code

741
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,110
even better so someone can go and
reproduce it or try and disprove your

742
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:48,090
findings and just ask them for
alternative findings based on what

743
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,400
you've given them if they come up with
something else

744
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,030
that's great that's not bad news that
just means that you can do some research

745
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,260
more and you may have found a friend or
a friend of me that you can help you

746
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,630
research stuff and some people will just
challenge your research because they're

747
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,430
jealous of what you do

748
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,710
how many people do you think were pissed
off when the car hacking research by

749
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:23,580
Chris and Chris and charlie miller and
yeah I'm sure there are a lot of people

750
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,000
that were upset not just the vendors but
other people that were dedicating a

751
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,720
whole bunch of time to researching that
kind of stuff and they may have lashed

752
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,129
out in appropriately to say you know
this is stupid why would you do this

753
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:39,368
you did it wrong you didn't take the
time to do this this and this

754
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:44,289
and they're just jealous they they want
some people just want to see the world

755
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:44,920
burn

756
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,980
and that happens don't think a personal
i skip that

757
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:56,769
so responsible disclosure please
disclose responsibly responsibly doesn't

758
00:56:56,769 --> 00:57:00,399
mean holding a vendor ransom or hostage

759
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,680
that's called extortion you could get
and very negative response from a vendor

760
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,109
so when we disclosed our stuff to toy
talk

761
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:13,450
who did the software for the hello
Barbie interaction they were really open

762
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,019
I got on we got on the phone with the
CTO he had his team there and they would

763
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:18,368
have constant update

764
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:24,339
calls with us to tell us how things were
progressing with the fixes that we had

765
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:29,470
reported and they kept asking us yet
when do you need to publish your

766
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,730
research by not don't publish your
research until we have it fixed

767
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,329
tell us when you need to have this
publish so we can prioritize how fast we

768
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,349
fix this thing

769
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:44,019
I thought that was great not only that
but they decided to give us 10 grand

770
00:57:44,019 --> 00:57:45,910
towards our research as a bug bounty

771
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,999
there was a bug bounty program at the
time they were starting one

772
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:52,419
the day after we reported it we didn't
know that and they're like you know what

773
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,150
these are significant finding will give
you guys 10 grand

774
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:59,259
cool like let Andrew take it all because
i'm canadian I didn't want the tax

775
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:01,450
headache but yeah they gave him ten
grand

776
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:06,700
that's pretty cool so just to summarize
a little bit here

777
00:58:07,299 --> 00:58:12,009
I hope that by looking at this you
realize that anyone can research

778
00:58:12,009 --> 00:58:15,880
something absolutely something anything

779
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,410
I just make sure that you have a
repeatable process that you can follow

780
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,129
and that if someone challenges you can .
the process you can point to the

781
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:28,329
analytics you can point to the data you
can point to the code that makes defend

782
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:33,640
your research that much easier and
disclose responsibly and understand that

783
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:41,210
people are going to hate you at some
point in your life just get past it

784
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,570
sometimes people like I said they just
want to see the world burn

785
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:49,400
so some further reading if you want to
get into the data science side of things

786
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:55,190
I strong I can't recommend enough the
executive data science and the data

787
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:00,590
science courses at Coursera fantastic
get you thinking even if you don't know

788
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:07,820
are so this is all done in our but it's
directly transferable over two pandas

789
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:13,400
and Python all the information very easy
to pick up if you don't want to sign up

790
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,050
for the course this link here is all of
the course materials but you do get a

791
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:21,380
lot from hearing full hearing them
present

792
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:28,040
I'm gonna sue codecademy if you like if
you want to learn a new language go

793
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,520
there

794
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,009
awesome these are all a bunch of books
that I actually own if you're doing any

795
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:38,570
sort of network inspection or traffic
analysis

796
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:44,240
this should be on your bookshelf this
will help you not try and memorize

797
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,979
offsets and different header information
and packets that you don't care about

798
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,000
until the time that you're trying to do
the research i've had that book on my

799
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,300
shelf for years and it is just as valid
then as it is now

800
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:05,450
yeah data-driven security shadow to j
and not so silent bob they wrote a great

801
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,529
book on how to visualize data and
present your findings

802
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,690
so yeah David security blog

803
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,550
Bob's blog myblog I post a lot of stuff
up there and opening a security live

804
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:25,610
they have a lot of great blogs on
presenting data and just how they take

805
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:28,610
their findings and the research and
communicated to the world

806
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:35,930
so with that does anyone have any
questions i have two more pairs of socks

807
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:45,830
no questions anyone actually question
has anyone gone to a conference and SAT

808
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,279
back and thought you know I should
really research something but I don't

809
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,730
know where to get started or yeah

810
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,970
do you know now yeah a little bit more

811
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,970
cool those are the two stock winners
right there

812
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:10,700
there you go or you're just trying to
not admit that you love watching you too

813
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:46,370
so I think think of your duty and this
guy's got a lot of slides and it didn't

814
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:50,089
and so what's your what's your specialty
right now

815
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:59,270
yes

816
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:02,270
yeah um crazy back there

817
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:07,370
yeah all right Bob

818
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:10,670
so ask yourself so what's the question
you're trying to answer how much spam

819
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,860
it--your why am I getting so much spam

820
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,010
it is really loose so you need to really
tighten that up

821
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:20,960
so pose a question or find a question so
I'm launching a website that's called

822
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,790
research something . com

823
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:25,880
and i'm going to start putting things up
there like you know here's a research

824
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,690
topic

825
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:32,390
someone go and do something but you need
to figure out a tight question with

826
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,589
constraints

827
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,620
that allow you to focus on just a small
piece

828
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,370
I OT devices it's great if you just want
to network side if you just run the

829
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,630
software side

830
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:45,680
it's or if you want to build tools you
know there's there's a lot of different

831
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,680
ways you can go

832
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:53,299
hi

833
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:59,030
start a blog honestly if you want to get
better writing start a blog you may not

834
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:02,780
think that you have anything to
contribute or to share but guarantee you

835
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,140
will publish something that not only
were you referencing like 2-3 years but

836
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,640
someone else for reference

837
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,810
I saw the blog post that gets hit all
the time on how to manually configure

838
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:17,990
interfaces on a bun - you know that
should be common knowledge now but

839
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:21,740
people still reference that when they're
searching for how the hell do i do this

840
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,569
you know that cut type of information
should be out there and you know why not

841
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:32,900
be the person to do it so I'm getting
kicked off here if you want to get a

842
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,580
hold of me find me on Twitter

843
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:38,569
Andrew SMA or send me an email and the
slides will be available

844
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:39,980
so yeah
