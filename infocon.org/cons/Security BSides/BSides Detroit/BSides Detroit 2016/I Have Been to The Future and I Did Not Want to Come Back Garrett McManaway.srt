1
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:39,660
just get here at the future and that
that I so my name is Darren command away

2
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,459
I've been in information security in
various shapes and forms now for about

3
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,930
15 years

4
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,320
I have done a lot of technical work done

5
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,399
leadership I've done consulting which
have a bunch of letters behind my name

6
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,460
that I don't usually use a master's
degree

7
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,450
I a father of twin girls who try to get
them dressed up like time travelers but

8
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,409
three year olds do not cooperate when
you wanted you so

9
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,780
ah but i want to give a a little bit of
background is how this talk to him about

10
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,619
was in when I started this my curb
position now previous position the

11
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,709
company I was working for was investing
in big d that as a solution for the

12
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:35,249
business which Eve security really a
chance to say hey here is a technology

13
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:36,630
that we have

14
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,499
how can we start to use this and this is
kind of some of the things that I

15
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:48,029
learned along the way our research into
the subject so I'm into it

16
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:51,450
I want to kind of start out talking
about some definitions in particular

17
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,429
those things that tend to be buzzwords
and used by vendors in making sure that

18
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,599
we're talking about the same thing in
particular and where we're going in to

19
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,669
this topic specifically i talked about a
little bit of history is what happened

20
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:10,348
to the pasta was gotten to this point in
really were some of the things i think

21
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:15,179
that we can apply this technology in the
future as well as what do we need to do

22
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,090
to prepare to take the next step into
big data as information security

23
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,960
professionals so I for

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,100
one threat intelligence you can use this
term in a lot of different ways

25
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
if you saw some of the topics that has
been giving over the last few days

26
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,369
she's talked about several different
ones i put for this talk specifically

27
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,860
we're taking about is taking information
in turning into data and more

28
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,400
specifically talking about data that can
be processed

29
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,180
so in this a lot of people think threat
intelligence right I'm going to go out

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,290
and I'm going to get this . feed and I'm
gonna pull it down and it's going to do

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,239
something magically for me and you
really isn't the case right

32
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,940
so when we take that information is
coming to us turning into data

33
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,930
so let's put it into our sim now start
running correlation rules around that

34
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,260
data we have something that's actionable
that we can use

35
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,060
and that's where i referred to as threat
intelligence here are in the actual

36
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,270
threat intelligence strategic threat
intelligence is something totally

37
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,600
different but we're talking about
actionable stuff here

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,140
so in indicators a compromise which is
kind of the byproducts the threat

39
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,100
intelligence

40
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:43,420
so these are this is data that becomes
acquired from previous compromise a

41
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,160
compromise attempts and we talked about
it a lot in the form of of static

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,990
indicators so IP addresses URLs hash
values things like that but there's new

43
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,400
the other side that you don't talk about
a lot or haven't really in recent years

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,920
and that's behavioral threat
intelligence

45
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,170
so think of this in a way where
potentially we can use static indicators

46
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:14,350
like you're up is a behavioral sort of
sort of Eden static indicators and say

47
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,790
if then touch tables or more so let's
see

48
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,380
execution of our from the recycle bin
right that's a behavior that's probably

49
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,800
not good right inside

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,699
that we would react to it we're gonna
sock and so from hunting

51
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,819
I think this is one where is the buzz
word is out there

52
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:45,159
the vendors pick up on it others have
picked up on it but it isn't one where

53
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,360
it's been really defined it can mean
really a lot of different things

54
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,669
realistically just having seen the work
pop up on us in could be a form of

55
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,500
rounding but to me when we talk about it
is really saying here now we have I Oh

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,889
Sees static behavioral whatever they
might be

57
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:11,440
let's use those to go see what has a is
sitting out there online environment or

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,919
you not just now but my what might have
happened in the past this is say the new

59
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,150
was being attacked that it comes out
that everyone's talking about in general

60
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,650
i like to think about this is seeing
this is proactive activity not

61
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,280
necessarily being that alert to pop up
but I'm taking this information

62
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,969
I'm going to and i'm searching my logs
you're looking you're using all the

63
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:36,039
tools that are already doing this one

64
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:47,560
so the hero analytics in this to me is a
use of algorithm that's looking for a

65
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,680
behavior of an energy so we use a lot
and user behavior analytics i think is

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,599
the biggest one that you'll hear prompt
but it's not just users you think about

67
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:05,830
it as saying and I can address hosting
it can be a person which is you can be

68
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,448
extremely useful but we're talking about
something that's really performed by a

69
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,449
machine here

70
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:24,430
in predictive analytics is releasing
okay if I know something and that

71
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,840
something changes

72
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,580
I can predict with some certainty that
something has happened when i do

73
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:40,150
settings change machine learning is my
favorite one from a buzzword term that a

74
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:47,560
really I think it's used quite often in
the way that I see it used is saying he

75
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,750
I've got a bunch of data I throw it up
into the cloud and I've got this agent

76
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,570
that sits out here and also does go look
up in the cloud and see that you five

77
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,210
stuff is there which is really just
comparing what you have here locally or

78
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,770
something it's in the cloud

79
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,310
that's not really machine learning
machine learning would say i have all

80
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,930
the spots up in the cloud

81
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,020
I have all this good stuff as well as we
create a mathematical model that can

82
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,409
start to find that bad stuff that's
sitting there and determine what the bad

83
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,170
stuff is my take new data in an
integrated into that cloud data platform

84
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,370
the machine learning algorithm is
predicting accurately that this is bad

85
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,040
data versus being good detail right

86
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:44,770
so any questions on those I so again to
some history and really i'll start

87
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:52,840
I think we're my information security
career started from a when I got into

88
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,500
things

89
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,740
releasing hear some of the things that
really existed right

90
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:05,560
antivirus firewalls industry and to some
extent was pretty readily available as a

91
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,270
a toolset it would say that there was a
lot of thinking the key this is enough

92
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,469
antivirus is going to check money 1 i'm
using a firewall

93
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm only allowing for de into my web
server

94
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,100
I'm good right so let's move along

95
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,849
on really kind of taking a look in
saying well and now in court 80 into my

96
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,130
firewall arm but there's some good stuff
flowing in there

97
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,539
that's some bad stuff flowing in there I
want to see the bad stuff so we started

98
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,030
Jewish things like intrusion detection

99
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,329
this is based on this signature in this
pattern of activity

100
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:58,470
something bad is happening for it so now
we get to a point where we say ok here's

101
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,000
some bad things happening

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,210
you know they're talking these
vulnerabilities

103
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,380
maybe I can proactively go out in pixels
vulnerabilities

104
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,490
so you come up with this thing called
vulnerability scanners that you just

105
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,870
that right

106
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,040
so take us

107
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,050
are we start to see things that were you
were Mike activity so they called Brad

108
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,029
Segall slammer in ids is really saying
hey this stuff is hitting the is coming

109
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,500
into my network

110
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,510
my idea is picking it up one we just
take this IDs and make it into a

111
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,480
protection mechanism so we move into
this mine thought that he we can take

112
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,070
all the stuff in our IDs

113
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,000
now we have prevention we're good
nothing bad is going to ever happen to

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,510
you

115
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:53,920
so ah then we get to the point where you
start to realize there are some other

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,599
things like say this acid form where it
was introduced into the internal network

117
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,670
take advantage of you

118
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,779
nivo abilities on the endpoint which is
where generally we weren't focusing on

119
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,660
vulnerability management and we were
watching

120
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,459
so we decided well you know what to fix
this we got stuck watching and we start

121
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,489
seeing things come out the tools that
come out to help us do this

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,370
eww sauce usse am NOT more current than
you from the window side that if we

123
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,220
actually start to touch the stuff we
don't have to worry about the worm

124
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,930
sitting our network right

125
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:32,979
as part of that we also kind of realized
that we really should be filtering these

126
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,220
ports like windows file sharing in
particular

127
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,320
smtp worms become popular on this time
RC and we start thinking about really

128
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,310
how do we filter this stuff thats
hanging out of our network

129
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,920
so the firewall now becomes this is
filtering just the traffic that's coming

130
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,670
into those web servers finances start
enforcing that filtering out bomb you

131
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,540
start also you know thinking like how do
we utilize the proxy server as well

132
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,620
right

133
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,680
totally up to this point it was seeing
from you being an admin no of practice

134
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,290
services at around this time

135
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,099
realistically they were being used as an
HR tool right

136
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,550
don't let the company go offices you see
porn

137
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,319
don't let him go see gunsights love
about right

138
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,130
we don't really start thinking about how
to utilize this technology to help

139
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,630
practice and how do we stop people from
potentially going to the more malicious

140
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,939
sites that might be out there

141
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:40,730
I talking to you know a little bit more
into the future to start to hit you hear

142
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,330
about a thing called Stuxnet right along
with that team a lot of a you talk about

143
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,840
20 days and virus is not effective

144
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,880
you know all these are the tools people
start talking about are really dad

145
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,650
technologies right

146
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,449
I think there's some truth to that they
say let's take the advance of our tools

147
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,190
we're going to take these executables
we're going to run them through a

148
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,200
virtual machine and see what happens
when that executable runs and based on

149
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,440
that we can determine if something is
good or bad right

150
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:26,510
so again going back 20 days and the
virus now very effective

151
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,710
advanced malware is doing some good
stuff

152
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,910
probably not is widely deployed it is it
could be and we start looking at other

153
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:41,600
solutions right so let's whitelist
executables what should only allow one

154
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,760
should be allowed to run in the flip
side of that seemed sort of Fury is

155
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,610
virtualization i'm going to let anything
run within the virtual machine for

156
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,780
saying my web browser but as soon as I
close my browser that virtual machine

157
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,990
months away and all the bad stuff has
gone with it

158
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,660
ok so we've got almost

159
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,890
in place realistically this point you
know we think we should good

160
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,000
there's a lot of stuff that's out there
attacking all this stuff or retiring to

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
protect us and we still have you just
the stuff for all its on top of it from

162
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,239
addie to the operational perspective
that we have to deal with right so

163
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,410
tuning all these tools making sure that
they're working so thinking about you

164
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,990
bring in my teens and things like that

165
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,840
third-party patch management how are we
watching flash and java you in

166
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,840
particular right these become really
huge problems

167
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,580
no spam through you know in fishing
intensely

168
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,160
this is just an ongoing problem and it
really becomes your bokmål type of

169
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,760
situation and I really saying hey you
know what our users are the cause of all

170
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,360
of this

171
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,870
we should start advocating them a little
bit don't click on the links that will

172
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,870
open up these crazy attachments

173
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,050
you know if you don't do business with
the bank he's asking for your

174
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,010
credentials

175
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:14,640
you probably shouldn't give them to you
do that Thank right so uh now where we

176
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,189
are realistically is there's been such a
change in the way that the network is

177
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,090
work

178
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,540
take all the most of that stuff and just
toss it out the window because we're

179
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,319
talking about

180
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,680
where before a large set of users your
data was sitting within the four walls

181
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,810
of a fitness center or something

182
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,770
that way we don't have that right you
have people who want to bring their own

183
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,819
devices

184
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,970
we have mobile computing and we have
cloud right

185
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,300
so think about it from the users where
you're odd here we have you know someone

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,000
using their personal cell phone to
access email and office 365

187
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,319
how can I protect myself from that right

188
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,180
I think there's some good solutions out
there they are really fully deployed the

189
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,620
containerization being one of them in
mobile particularly digital rights

190
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,520
management being some others but really
outside of the scope of what i want to

191
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,630
talk about just releasing a we've got

192
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,290
all the stuff that we thought was
protecting us the world has changed

193
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:30,500
we have to rethink what we're doing at
this point so the general theory has

194
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,700
become over time that protection

195
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,220
the static tape of devices like
antivirus like firewalls are going to

196
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,120
help us

197
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,110
they're still need it they're still
necessary but the only way that we're

198
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,300
really going to be able to stop the bad
guy he is going through the process of

199
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,910
detection and response right

200
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,300
so assuming the theory is that if we can
catch and respond quick enough that

201
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,500
we've stopped

202
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,680
whatever the breaches or whatever the
bad thing is going to happen

203
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
uh over the process of this what we've
done

204
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:14,689
he is taking a lot of those technologies
and came for this thing called sin right

205
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,450
so we're going to take all that data

206
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:26,060
we're going to toss it into a bunch of
storage and you turn on some correlation

207
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,569
rules in somatic is going to happen
right

208
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,730
ah how many people actually have us in
and has that actually helped you

209
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,670
and realistically think through all my
data and it's going to magically come

210
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,699
out and tell you everything has been the
world's been fixed alright so generally

211
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,640
sort of right so it's a a challenging
the pulling these devices that are

212
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,090
supposed to be helping us in taking in
you know kind of seeing you really think

213
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,800
the problems around sim in the problems
in developing sim the candy and husband

214
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:11,209
its own talk over time but just you even
saying taking the past practice of sim

215
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:16,490
today which is seeing take your use
cases develop them and utilize those use

216
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,920
cases to only bring in the data that you
want and create the alerts that you want

217
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,520
and be able to respond to those looks
you want

218
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,980
still creates this massive set of data
is he is we get into it we start seeing

219
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,550
only I have to respond so it really need
the dns logs to detection but i do need

220
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,760
them for response so they're going into
the sim because we don't really have any

221
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,980
place also stored right arm at least the
most companies

222
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,950
I in you know fast solution you have
some miller syslog repositories .

223
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,190
something else holding all this massive
deal step right

224
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,429
excuse me so over the course of this

225
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:09,640
we really just created ourselves this
giant problem right of having all this

226
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,750
deed up sitting there it's expensive to
store and sim

227
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,590
ah we have vulnerability information

228
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:23,500
it's difficult to get those things
really remediated right

229
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,190
anyone that's been availability
management program and also this is like

230
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,630
we have a ton of threat intelligence
data that's flowing on us so we have a

231
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,780
big problem

232
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:42,580
which is really to me a big solution
right so we talk about all this coming

233
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,379
in in taking some of the definitions
that we talked about predictive

234
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,270
analytics behavioral analysis and
machine learning with all the data that

235
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,460
we collected for ourselves over the
years we can start applying some of big

236
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,990
data analysis techniques to help us
solve the problem right

237
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,600
so as I mentioned it really when it
started this

238
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,899
our research into this it was to really
the business asking for big data to

239
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,400
support their problems

240
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,250
so the business is actually infinitely
how to security when we start talking

241
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,120
about these things because they come up
and said hey I think I've got all this

242
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,270
information they can help you make real
business decisions

243
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:43,929
oh so let's start applying that now to
information security specifically I so

244
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,920
these are some of the things are really
happening today and we talked about in

245
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,830
detection and threat hunting
specifically when we can just do simple

246
00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:01,720
relational ship connection of various
different pieces of data it can really

247
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,850
help us in turning into a visualized map
look something like that up there right

248
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,429
so this IP address is talking to this
you know other IP address you shares

249
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,680
this stone same domain name and this
user does this in as you can start to

250
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,330
see that in a visualized sheep you
circle realize how you

251
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,340
how can that did some of these events
that we have going on actually are right

252
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:33,040
so we can kind of see this as well the
visualization appearance and these are

253
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,470
kind of difficult between um is really
looking at a fence data from you read

254
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,870
our sin and seeing the heat

255
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,189
you want some of the factors are
actually connected together so as I'm an

256
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,870
analysis

257
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,889
analysts turn to look at this
information i can start to look at these

258
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:55,290
is one big thing is opposed to you
several little things that are happening

259
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,690
along the chain this attack that allows
them to say hey I got a big problem let

260
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,890
me respond to that appropriately worse
say oh wait

261
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,480
money malware no problem like in that
machine but we forgot

262
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,710
oh the laterally noob not for the domain
controller but hey that looks connected

263
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,820
so I holy crap call me and some of these
mascots right

264
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,210
the other part of this to you is really
just looking at those things that are

265
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,550
statistical outliers

266
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:33,690
so in giving an example user behavior
right

267
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,170
I think this is a perfect you way to
look at this

268
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,740
so I was a user normal user during the
course of business tends to do the same

269
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,290
things day in and day out right

270
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,440
you think about what you do are you in

271
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,210
apply it to you the business users as
well it's the same sort of thing right

272
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,070
come in and check my email ah you'll
probably spend some time doing that I go

273
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,059
to a meeting

274
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,840
check your email gotomeeting don't
really do any real work until you know

275
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,090
for clock but you know

276
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,520
hey that's generally the day at of what
actual real users are doing right

277
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,860
so we need to start to move away from
that pattern you can kind of think that

278
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:25,830
user usually is not traveling to France
and connecting to the VPN i have a

279
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,899
problem here i might want to go look at
right so just taking that that data

280
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,690
visualizing it using some of the tools
that big data use it i think is

281
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,690
extremely helpful for this use days

282
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,899
this up further isn't that long building
management right

283
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:52,649
it's very difficult thing to do and do
successfully you're fighting one and

284
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:55,168
ever-changing about the battle right

285
00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:00,119
vulnerabilities happened to come out
monthly microsoft tuesday which is

286
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,178
generally no releasing vulnerabilities
or break Thunder Thunder citizen . we

287
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,820
bottle with the network teens and server
teams to get time to actually fix a

288
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,090
meeting these things in which you

289
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,860
they come back and say why am I doing
this right and it's something we have to

290
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,168
explain to them and say well if you
don't fix us something might happen

291
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,369
right

292
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:31,379
so I think put yourself and not in that
role right

293
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,869
I'm spending a lot of time fixing
something that might happen instead of

294
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:42,570
you know he going out in helping say a
user address their problems help

295
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,779
stopping them from completing their
business right

296
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:52,499
ah let's see you can take you this
information we take information that we

297
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:55,440
have we've already collected right

298
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,070
we have attacked it from our IPS devices

299
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,220
whatever also my e comfort him we only
have a risk registry of things that are

300
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,029
happening from a risk perspective that
we have information about the

301
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:11,909
vulnerabilities themselves we have our
threat intelligence

302
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:18,360
hopefully we have information about that
assets themselves which is generally one

303
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,449
of the biggest challenges in
vulnerability management but he

304
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,759
hopefully we do at this point we have
good data classification of our logs all

305
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,720
other flows

306
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,710
let's take this and say realistically
here's this vulnerability

307
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,928
p I have risked records open because
there's other issues going on

308
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,559
systemically that aren't necessarily
related to the vulnerability may be

309
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,389
related to the fact that it's

310
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,190
in the wrong segment in our network for
example you know i will start to take

311
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,030
some of this

312
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,470
pull it all together and say you know
what this server is sitting in our core

313
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,560
which is a a violation of our policy is
vulnerable to these five critical things

314
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,620
that are actually being attacked in
being attacked it our organization right

315
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,000
so now my story going back to those
people that are supposed to be helping

316
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,460
us resolve these changes

317
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,970
it isn't just he you're fixing this
because something might happen

318
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,160
you're fixing this because it is
actually happening now and we have other

319
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,550
problems that could cause us to be much
greater

320
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:32,090
if this mobility was actually exported
so so protect

321
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,510
since anything that this is one where
it's here becomes are almost science

322
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:43,490
fiction right and we haven't really
thought about how to utilize this

323
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,490
information security

324
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,549
I'm thinking but the business house
right

325
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,860
so the inn in particular I think the
story general here is that we have all

326
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:00,649
this data if I changed my marketing
strategy can predict a lollipop it's

327
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,919
gonna be all right I think that's
something it that the business people

328
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,270
have solved using a big cup for those
that have invested in the type type of

329
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,740
technology so apply it to us right

330
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:17,840
uni now start using and protect our
mattress eating

331
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:30,409
if we you mean time for us to respond
and resolve the incident is apps if we

332
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:40,100
can say add an additional analysts that
picture does that become last you know

333
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,779
in theory it should but you know I
needed to prove that right

334
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:50,330
we also realistically probably say if we
don't add that analysts how much data

335
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,870
are we losing it that point because we
think we have an updated to show

336
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:01,250
ok we're this good we could be this
batter and that means that we are you

337
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,720
know providing this much of information
we write and going back to the other

338
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,240
side's knowing that we have things like
information about that data you can

339
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,929
probably take it a step further and say
not just are we losing data but we're

340
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,380
losing our critical data

341
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,180
so anything the other one that's been in
in my heart that I think he can probably

342
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,470
really be done today if we really put
our minds to it using the technologies

343
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,440
that are out there available to us is
predicting those users that are most

344
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,720
likely to fall for fishing or social
engineering talk right

345
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,380
so i take someone using comics and spawn
in purple

346
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,370
that's probably like right there my list
anyone in sales

347
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,360
one in the developers those type of
people we think are probably going to be

348
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,639
kind of vulnerable right to tend to have
you from a sales perspective they're

349
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
seeing here I just want to sell and get
something done

350
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,070
developers are constantly saying i need
administrative rights write a song all

351
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,060
kinds of crazy tools have code on the
machines generally that are running

352
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,970
through which is really think about it

353
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:19,970
IP of the company of you some future
product or service or something right

354
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:27,890
so so to you now

355
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:36,020
a step further putting into machine
learning and modeling you be the problem

356
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:41,660
that that happens and comes up as you
know anyone that's been in this industry

357
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,890
for a while is the budget for
information security generally is not

358
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,470
growing internally not growing for
information technology is journaling you

359
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:57,740
need a lot of cases not growing at all
across the board right so we get to a

360
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,940
point where it becomes time to see me
what I need to figure out how to reduce

361
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,470
my budget

362
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,340
if I can start creating models based on
all the data that we've been talking

363
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,600
about

364
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,969
I can start saying well what if i take
this out for this protection mechanism

365
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,680
out how does my wrist change right

366
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,710
so that becomes very valuable to really
you know help take to upper management

367
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,540
and see you want

368
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,120
arm I can't find anything that we can
really remove but maybe if we keep tweak

369
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,379
this a little bit

370
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,770
we're pretty good and we're going to
save about a hundred grand by doing that

371
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:44,450
um so that's that's think really helping
someone make a business decision

372
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,300
you know that business decision is based
around information technology right so

373
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,200
our thing about as well right

374
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,540
hey sales guys coming to sell you this
new box with all these NC you blinking

375
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,700
lights if i can put that in my network
is a POC and start gathering data up

376
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,170
I can probably use that same model to
predict do I knew that you can see you

377
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,830
blinking light box to help me out or not

378
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:25,159
right so I and this is kind of a one of
the things that that I came to the

379
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,480
conclusion of just looking at this and
saying he in theory i think a lot of

380
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,230
this stuff can be done if we took the
upper to utilize the technology

381
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,560
finding the right people that can and
know how to use the technology to create

382
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,860
these algorithms create the applications
and those things that you need to

383
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,820
basically apply all those use cases
right

384
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,929
I think they're completely doable but we
need smart people to do it

385
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:56,210
so on the flip side of this is being a
manager of the department that was to

386
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,680
take this over

387
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,710
I i have to go out and find someone who
knew how to use this technology are not

388
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,430
easy

389
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,830
there are not a lot of people that know
about the the big data type of

390
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:15,379
technologies in all about security in
the few that do want Silicon Valley

391
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,900
money right be in michigan

392
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:26,000
I didn't have a silicon valley budget
right so our string that anything would

393
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,010
think really happened is we kind of
realize that are you

394
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:38,210
this technology really is your future
need based on the fact that we need to

395
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,200
fix some

396
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,799
other systemic problems first so let's
put this on the back burner

397
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,409
I instead I think about it that really
what we need to do is find someone who

398
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:53,000
understood either security really well
and can be taught about Big Data if I

399
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,840
someone who understood big data really
well and we talked about security

400
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,699
so at this point I kind of started doing
some research into you know what's being

401
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,950
taught out there right

402
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:14,690
so if i'm not a study done by poem on
about the top five universities for info

403
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,909
SEC degrees so I know there are six on
the side which is because there are the

404
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:21,799
number four was tied

405
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:28,250
so are you hugging me want to meet you
over politics but really looking into

406
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,789
this

407
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:35,419
a you know some of these schools tend to
stand out as you would think that they

408
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:43,429
are you know technology university they
have good programs but you looking at

409
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:46,039
their academic courses that were offered

410
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:53,960
there are very few that offered anything
in the security programs around big data

411
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,130
right

412
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,399
no some things that are included in here
right

413
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,418
even the Stamford it's a research
university they're really doing stuff

414
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:06,860
and big data you could research the the
crap out of impulse second big data if

415
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,459
you wanted to and find people there
they're going to help you learn now

416
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,510
right

417
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,529
but for most of us we are going to a
university like this to say hey I want

418
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:22,070
to go into information security on you
know thinking about this realistically I

419
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,689
go into a program today in four years
from now we're going to be using big

420
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,120
data whether we really want to or not

421
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,010
right

422
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:35,080
these kids should be coming out of
school and four years and how some idea

423
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,490
of the big deal is

424
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:43,210
and promise we're just not really seeing
that so I the only one on this list that

425
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,710
really found that did have included in
the program was / you but it was in

426
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,930
their masters program and basically some
of the research deputy was doing you

427
00:33:52,930 --> 00:34:00,820
know outside of really the academic
programs themselves so arm

428
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,419
it took a little bit further and said
hey let's look locally

429
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:10,418
I'm so we went out and looked at the NSA
center of excellence and pulled up some

430
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,888
of the schools that were in Michigan
that have information security programs

431
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:22,540
one of these the news a school that I've
attended I in the you in another one

432
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,168
I think has a a very good information
security program

433
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,580
I personally hired several people out of
that school that had been printed task

434
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:40,540
right but there is like really nothing
in any of these schools Eastern has one

435
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,540
intro class is what I found

436
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,678
Paris has it in their masters program
but its base more around business

437
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,649
intelligence and not specific to
security

438
00:34:53,649 --> 00:35:05,440
ah so being in information security and
we tend to have to teach ourselves a lot

439
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,490
right IE here in in uh I'll see this a
lot right

440
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,370
I think the best permissions can be
people are those that have had

441
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,750
experience in other areas of the key
before they go into involved where I

442
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,710
know something about server in this
condition I know something about network

443
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,860
administration

444
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:30,350
I really know how Windows works when
something goes right because what we

445
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,350
look at is what happens when something
goes wrong

446
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:41,120
alright so because of that he he did you
kind of have to to have a wide body of

447
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,130
knowledge intend to cheat yourself

448
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,550
it was like he's on top of that
knowledge that we've been training for

449
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,830
so I want to throw out a few things that
i did find for kind of the continuing

450
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,759
education

451
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,720
if you want to go to learn more about
Big Data ain't cloudera and Hortonworks

452
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,859
are the two that to me I think big
players in this area

453
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:10,220
they both offer training um I can see if
it's for your nominated and the website

454
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,470
really didn't discover that as much but
I'm assuming not although cloudera

455
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,839
offers a image of their software the
evening download for free

456
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,100
good you know and certainly those
restrictions on what you can get away

457
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,299
with it you probably can't running
enterprise on there for you I so but it

458
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,950
is available right

459
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,529
the other option and one of the ways
that I kind of learned in started

460
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:42,470
teaching myself is there's a number of
processes on Coursera which is you can

461
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:50,089
have a free you sharing of information
written by universities

462
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:57,590
so you know it's out there if you want
to go find it and cold air is free but

463
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,590
um

464
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,510
and lastly what I wanted to kind of
share is just talking about

465
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,790
and by no way do i endorsed anybody on
this list but these are some of the

466
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,520
vendors that I had personally look that
you can say that they are investing in

467
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,970
doing things that I call Big Data
Solutions Inc used when you talk about

468
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,959
machine learning

469
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:30,500
they actually do it well so if you want
to or looking to you to check this out

470
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,980
in the industry and here's a few ways he
needs to start

471
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:42,320
ah i will say my my my opinion on this
is there are some people that are doing

472
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,410
some good work but there hasn't been a
solution that's close to being complete

473
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,870
right should I take some of this
somebody environment and and get some

474
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,740
really quick

475
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:05,750
good games absolutely but take a company
like ah topspin who is actually a I

476
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,200
forget the actual term are using but
really it's kind of like putting out of

477
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,109
money honey pots on your network of the
same time they're collecting information

478
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,830
about what's happening on the network
and putting it through algorithms in

479
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,690
machine learning and such right

480
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,230
so they've changed from what they were
originally doing - something entirely

481
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,070
different which you know keep that in
mind because we have young companies

482
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:30,860
that are you using the Boz works to sell
their product that you want to make sure

483
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,280
that you're looking it strategically
what are they doing in the future and

484
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:45,380
where that going with the technology so
I in with that as my Twitter and

485
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,760
LinkedIn

486
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,800
generally the best ways to get a whole
need uh I know there's quite a bit of

487
00:38:51,800 --> 00:39:08,859
time I don't have any questions but I

488
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:11,859
re you can get

489
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:28,960
I know you know I am NOT and I have not
on their words are probably people that

490
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,190
are a lot smarter than me

491
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,869
competing in those right there I have no
idea i can't tell you anything about the

492
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:40,269
the math behind any of this but that's
why I think the people that can are

493
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:43,450
demeaning in two hundred thousand
dollars a year right

494
00:39:43,450 --> 00:40:04,839
so on the low end else they think it's a
little bit of both

495
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,460
right think about it from sin

496
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:18,759
today when we have intake user this
thing down in front of that sin

497
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:23,650
responding to the alert so whatever they
may be doing in-house some knowledge of

498
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,950
how the mechanism that created that
alert works can make a lot better

499
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,308
decisions on how to handle that'll right

500
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:37,960
so I think there's at least some basic
knowledge of understanding what we mean

501
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,480
when we say a MapReduce job in blood
type of data we are collecting in how

502
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,779
the tools work from that perspective but
he went back and said you you have

503
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:52,130
vendors that are using this technology

504
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:59,810
are you uh II throne but again just my
opinion

505
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,779
what I found in a lot of cases of them
really have the map down great but the

506
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,180
visualization sucks right

507
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,290
so if i have great visualization I can
sit in front of an analyst and they're

508
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,700
going to be able to you

509
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:19,430
you pick that apart anything make peace
and decisions but until we get both of

510
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,200
those things working together

511
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,540
you need some sort of i think someone
with that data science background or at

512
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:33,290
least the basic understanding of so I'm
and keep in mind in some of the big

513
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,509
financial institutions are really doing
this

514
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,370
thank you more on the fraud side but if
you look at what they do you beat that

515
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,700
I don't think they're really using
off-the-shelf programs they're going out

516
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,730
and finding someone who is implementing
these sorts of things for them

517
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:51,350
alright so if you wanted to go implement
this today you're really you know stock

518
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,000
and sing he and i can use this
technology see where it's going or I'm

519
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,390
going out and find someone who can take
the technology and make the applications

520
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:12,799
on top of myself but I 18

521
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,090
so these are just want to come up to my
mind right I think that there are

522
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:24,740
infinite solutions out there to use the
technology and you really listen to this

523
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,899
thing is that i don't think we have
found the people with both skill sets to

524
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,740
come together and figure that out right
I mean these are things that you just I

525
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,729
guess that really popped into my mind
like he went as I'm learning about this

526
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:43,700
maybe I can do this right I the ink is
the vendors are selling it is they're

527
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:50,990
targeting more eyes user behavior
analytics and your threat hunting but

528
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,370
you

529
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:57,770
I don't think the thought has gone into
the predictive part to really take that

530
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,570
in turn it into something it becomes
useful in making your business decisions

531
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,259
just well 14 pretty bad at that

532
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,240
in information security 90 to begin with
so you got to figure out ways

533
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:28,710
get no problem so you just inherited all
the problems that i've been talking

534
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,900
about so by all means

535
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,560
haha so ah the you think of another way
one of them say you didn't notice them

536
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,070
looking at some of these universities
and programs at the offer anything

537
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,150
Kristen mentions it is you the offer a
ton of classes in forensics right now

538
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,930
which is great because it's something
it's a field where we really really need

539
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:49,830
people

540
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:55,470
but if we can start you capturing say
you a lot of participated that these in

541
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:01,140
certain spots people start to capture
after the fact before thousands on going

542
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:09,150
and store into your big data which is in
meant to be cheap in in storage in

543
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,360
compute the that forensic field of
looking at what happened in the past is

544
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,220
changes dramatically right because all
I'm doing is running according to data

545
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:26,549
already have collected or realistically
up . models that know how to do this and

546
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,970
it learned about the bad stuff are
running is just presented to be going

547
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:30,959
away right

548
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,960
so that's kinky a more realistic
probably application in the near future

549
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,360
I'm sorry you get up here and the
earlier you

550
00:46:49,390 --> 00:47:39,160
you

551
00:48:47,010 --> 00:50:26,840
ok

552
00:50:26,840 --> 00:51:00,290
Oh

553
00:51:33,700 --> 00:52:19,629
yeah but I me me

554
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:34,149
yes yeah

555
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,740
in Delta are in this situation as
students or instructors that are sitting

556
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,330
in the room he from a student
perspective need to go back to your

557
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:48,460
administration in your instructors and
see what i see this is a problem

558
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,690
why am I not being taught about this
right in the same with you

559
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,710
those people that are instructing let's
start pulling us into you

560
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:13,720
the process that you're building create
right it's it's important that said that

561
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,720
up

562
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,810
so when that same person but it

563
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:37,149
so how's that your administration come
talk to me or are right

564
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:43,240
come yeah so come talk to me or Chris or
other people like us that our managers

565
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,200
of information security programs because
we're going to tell that same person

566
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,000
you're creating a bunch of people that
are on hireable right so that person is

567
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,020
also going to quickly find that out when
they're going to be going back to the

568
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,130
four-year degree in some place where
they can really get real skill set

569
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,290
all right so I know it's not seeing it's
an instructor problem the fix

570
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:11,080
it's an administration problem the pics
and you have you really the I think the

571
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,799
inroads to start having those
conversations with the business people

572
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,800
that can help you out

573
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:36,170
all right
