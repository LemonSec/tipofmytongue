1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,290
hello guys we're going to start right
now

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,189
so here I am Dave Shafer and basically
i'm gonna talk about privacy white

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,510
matters and i think i have to have this
conversation mainly because i was a

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,029
faculty member at a couple institutions
and every time every semester began what

5
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,050
i did was i we create the students and
this is in cyber security

6
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,280
by the way I taught offensive defensive
security heard this guy is talking about

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,170
- play it was just before me

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,300
yeah we we've done that stuff to a lot
of stuff is high hands-on labs and I

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,949
give them scenarios really big long
scenarios about 15 pages long and make

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,559
them really critically think but armed
with it said these people I thought

11
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,879
would be more in tune and more sensitive
to actually publish and stop out to the

12
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,018
web and you know through facebook
twitter and all those other different

13
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,780
social media avenues and what I found
out was like between about sixty to

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,740
eighty percent eighty-five percent at
one point other people that I query

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,548
didn't care about what they posted in
media and this kind of astounded me

16
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,689
because i read this i read a couple
books now I don't know if you ever heard

17
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,100
about edwin black

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,589
well there's a couple books here i mean
if you guys want to pass them around you

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,460
can check them out on but I read these
books in the kind of started with this

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,179
one IBM in the Holocaust i'm going to
talk about this here today

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,829
so um and I always wanted to do a
presentation on this because of it

22
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,759
because it really did shift my paradigm
and it's not the history that you would

23
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,119
see that is published in your tax box
that's first and foremost

24
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,450
this is the history they actually happen
this is the history that they're trying

25
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,430
to hide from the nation in a way arm
course it's out there

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,930
obviously the facts are there and
everything but if you have to dig for it

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,229
on Edwin black did that very thing

28
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,060
so

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,090
with that said I have to say there's a
warning

30
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,560
ok this is not for the squeamish the
following content contains mature

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,590
subject matter their pencils I'll its
audiences

32
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,299
I usually like to try to make jokes
during presentations and stuff like that

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,980
just because i do have somewhat of a
sense of humor but with in regards to

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,399
this

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,660
it's a very subject it's very sensitive
matter and it really does

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,620
it's kind of disturbance what has
happened and it does deal with deaths of

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,620
babies and a whole bunch of other stuff
along the way

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,910
so if your idea of a conversation is
very technical or if you have arm

39
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,950
if you have any kind of problem with
stomach and different types of faxes

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,950
as far as how people are treated in a
dark past

41
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,910
then you might want to kind of remove
yourself at this point

42
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:02,630
so why do why do we do this so because
those who do not remember the past are

43
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,840
condemned to repeat it so not a
conspiracy theory it's very important to

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,600
point out that i spent quite a number of
hours and days actually researching to

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,160
give you this presentation

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,620
so this is not me with my tinfoil hat
like put on and make it up soft here on

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,109
it's based off of fact if you look at
the back of those books and that's one

48
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,329
of the reasons why I'm having you guys
pass around look at him

49
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:30,950
you'll see that there's a lot of
research that Edwin black did himself

50
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,819
that is actually documented in that in
the back of every one of those books so

51
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,560
eugenics movement is based on the fact
it can be researched proven historically

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,310
the items presented here are from
various publications it's not just that

53
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,319
one black but you know we have we have
Bruce we have the eff we have American

54
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,540
Civil light Civil Liberties Union to
mention a few and stay at this are

55
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,700
provided via the pew research

56
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,720
so I'm merely connecting the dots for
you ok i'm not trying to make up any of

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,389
this stuff along the way about me

58
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:07,069
well I was a full-time instructor I
stepped down from that and I i have been

59
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,730
attending conferences like a kind last
year and stuff like that that's my van

60
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,179
down by the river with it

61
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,340
but um i guess if you take Craig Smith
and and I you put them together you

62
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,668
might have this little guy but on

63
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,698
that's kind of where I was before

64
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,360
and where i am now is I'm kind of
seeking other opportunities but

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,180
observations just the overview

66
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,840
we're going to provide privacy versus
security we're talking about that we're

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,830
going to give you some statistical
observations of the here and now we're

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,430
also going to talk about governments and
corporations along the way and where

69
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,020
they felt ethically ok or failed
ethically we're also going to talk about

70
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,870
the current privacy issues and then
hopefully give you some what of a

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,960
conclusion now I state title this talk
the cheap in the Shepherd and i found

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,630
this picture and I thought this was
probably good picture okay so we have

73
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,199
somebody up here on a wall he's he's
representing the government and then

74
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,449
basically TV set which is actually come
into play later in this presentation on

75
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,020
you know they reaching out and they're
shaving the sheet so who are the Sheep

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,900
the people the people they shape is
pretty much people that are

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,739
automatically like given the right away
and they really don't care about the

78
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,490
rights to privacy and they're just
posting whatever they want about them

79
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,599
and their family

80
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,479
now this is a good picture I mean how
many people to help saw this picture

81
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,880
before it's about trade-offs right
everybody wants to think that these are

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,699
trade-offs for privacy versus security

83
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,360
well actually this is a live this is a
trade-off vs liberty and controls what

84
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,620
we're talking about here

85
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,780
it's about our freedoms and the ability
to actually give up those freedoms so

86
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,750
that we can be controlled even more from
the government

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,349
so when we think about privacy we think
about keeping our data safe from people

88
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:55,090
that are not authorized to do that type
of data but we also think about privacy

89
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,789
itself it is a concept entirely separate
from security however it can be private

90
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,800
if we can use certain countermeasures
like encryption to secure data

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,560
encryption is definitely one of the
solutions long way

92
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,910
the Tor network

93
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,830
and that that type of her in transit a
traffic

94
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,159
if you have something that's highly
sensitive and or you don't want people's

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,740
pride on your vpns that helps out arm
and i can give you a little bit of

96
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,530
background but sometimes like when we're
talking about privacy versus security

97
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,739
though there is a can mean a lot of
things and there's sometimes there is

98
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,070
things that makes a lot of sense

99
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,640
as far as a security trade-off arm or
you know

100
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,390
your privacy trade-off for security I
say like your credit card information

101
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,320
like you get free credit card monitoring
services from the companies like

102
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,370
American Express is something that but
if a transaction occurs in another state

103
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,850
you gave a privacy for them to actually
monitor her what's being purchased on

104
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,390
your card and where for them to call you
up and say hey wait a minute something's

105
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,120
being purchased down in taxes

106
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,150
ok did you make this transaction you get
a phone call

107
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,659
well you're giving up their privacy ok
and that's something that we actually

108
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,010
probably like to have in a way because
we don't want to have somebody

109
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,800
fraudulent Lee purchasing stuff on our
credit card

110
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,300
so there are some times when that the
security of the overall makes sense

111
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,090
however sometimes it doesn't make sense
uh let's think about when we actually

112
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,270
metadata and and in general we've talked
about geocaching and stuff like that and

113
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,120
geocaching of information and I'm a
father for girls

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,270
you want to make much sense from a
security standpoint to actually post my

115
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,680
private information

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,640
uh I the picture I take have taken my
four little girls beautiful girls in my

117
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,320
house with geodata geocache data located
on the information so that people can

118
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,090
just figure out exactly where I live

119
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,659
it's basically given a pedophile the
information that he needs to go ahead

120
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,350
and try to target my family and that's
that type of trade off

121
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,350
it doesn't really make much sense I
think we can all probably pretty much

122
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,340
agree on that

123
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,460
now Bruce is my hero

124
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,979
ok he's like the chuck norris right of
of security arm and basically he's got a

125
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,620
couple different quotes here I wanted to
talk about

126
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,890
he says if i'm doing anything wrong

127
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,510
this is this is the general quote that I
I've heard from other students and he

128
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,460
brings up and one of his articles and
here's the argument if I'm doing

129
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,589
if I'm not doing anything wrong then you
have no cause to watch me

130
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,339
the problem with this is that Bruce
brings up is that governments to find

131
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,870
what's wrong and they keep on changing
that definition and that's something we

132
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,640
have to be mindful of privacy is not
about hiding a wrong

133
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,740
privacy is about in an inherit human
right and a requirement for maintain and

134
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,670
the human condition with dignity and
respect and that's what we're going to

135
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,819
talk about a little bit about eugenics
today because it had a lot to do with

136
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,350
dignity and respect and a lot to do with
privacy and a lot to do with security

137
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,319
so Americans hold strong views about
privacy in everyday life

138
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,180
so can we say that privacy matters but
then why is social media so big you know

139
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,750
because a lot of people think and say
that that privacy matters we got like

140
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,650
seventy four percent of the people here
in this poll from Pew Research and

141
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,329
they're saying it matters but yet i'll
show you another sentence the stat later

142
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,320
that kind of contradicts that

143
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,500
so perhaps we've given up on the the the
fact that we actually do have anything

144
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,810
private today's information age

145
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,680
so they're saying if you express
confidence that their records will

146
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,609
remain private and secure so there's
some more stats up there and perhaps

147
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,260
this is why as you say they have little
they have a locking a lot of control

148
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,959
over the information and there's 30
april seven people say that they have

149
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,349
some control 37c not much control and
nine percent say they have a lot of

150
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,850
control so somehow they're like either
like not living on the grid

151
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,400
maybe in the backwoods le summers I
don't know

152
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,000
but eugenics itself when we talk about
eugenics

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,420
how many people have heard about
eugenics cool

154
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:37,099
this is abnormal totally abnormal Peppa
which is great because I'm abnormal - I

155
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,200
want to be up here talking about it but
eugenics itself is the self direction of

156
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,550
human evolution

157
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:51,800
so the idea is basically founded that
it's its meaning itself is comes from

158
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,150
the greek words

159
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,040
well and born and it's about create a
superior race by weeding out the weak or

160
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,730
either limits in the productive organs
or eliminating them completely

161
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,090
here is a timeline a research when we
talk about eugenics and it all started

162
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:14,990
in 1863 when Sir Francis Galton term
eugenics and he's the one that actually

163
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,950
created the work

164
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,900
ok you know using those those German
words well and born and he's the cousin

165
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,860
to Darwin

166
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,880
ok and that was in Europe when he did
that but 1911 Carnegie's supported a

167
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,590
study that recommended gas chambers for
people that are actually in car negated

168
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,240
by the way is in the United States

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,410
ok arm they recommend a gas chambers for
people that are not well fit for society

170
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,390
arm

171
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,000
this was led by the research by blacker
than wag magnin who declared that

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,940
effective inherence interior 10 should
be limited eliminated from the human

173
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,460
stock in 1912 we came out with a
publication and it was too surprised it

174
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,750
was well received by quite a few
scientists and what we're talking about

175
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,610
here is at this point

176
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,990
this critical point in time means in
1911 in 1912 and the acceptance of these

177
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,730
ideas in America

178
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,000
by the way in the United States as you
say i don't know if we want to include

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,820
everybody in America like canadians I
don't know if they want to be included

180
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,560
in this but

181
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,819
at this point we have a failure we have
a failure couple things we have a

182
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,750
failure

183
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,170
ethics we have a failure it in in at
least fight this day and age by our

184
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,360
terminology but by their terminology and
when we talked about ethics itself from

185
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,880
their standpoint they thought it was
ethical

186
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,620
ok so ethics sometimes is what people
make of it

187
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,790
ok but we also have scientists that are
actually getting paid and bankrolled and

188
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,910
they're making crap off that didn't make
any sense

189
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:03,920
ok and this is what spewed all on in
1915 the Chicago native call called

190
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,589
Harry the black stork was going around
making movies and touring the country

191
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:16,339
talking about how he kills babies that
were genetically defective and this all

192
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,200
happened in America in 1918 California

193
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,320
Paul open home a US army of venereal
disease specialist who was part of the

194
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,100
eugenics movement and helped to spur
along in california which is actually by

195
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,070
the way was lead-in most offensive state
in the Union arm went down is saying

196
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:44,450
that uh the first record of met the
first method of of recommendations that

197
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,500
he can make his executors that that we
should follow is execution

198
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,670
ok so we're not even talking about
fixing people like so that they can't

199
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,959
have babies

200
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,500
we're talking about right there from the
Army in California

201
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,670
he's talking about exterminating people
okay in the united states by the way

202
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,099
world war two didn't happen at this
point

203
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,410
ok and that's the most important thing
to remember in 1933 at least twelve

204
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,800
hundred and seventy-eight coriko um
chorus of sterilizations were being

205
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,000
performed each year in California seven
hundred and women alone

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,660
women were by far the most the the the
population that was most affected by

207
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,930
sterilizations at this point so

208
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,209
who were the targets eugenics I think we
have to talk about this a little bit

209
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,550
the targets include the people minded
some of those people were called you

210
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,839
know people minded

211
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,680
just because they were introverts and we
as a cybersecurity this is kind of like

212
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,709
concerns me because i know that i work
with a whole bunch of entry bar for its

213
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,430
ok

214
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,790
from seibert security perspective and
those people are very intelligent

215
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,870
usually they're taking a lot more in
than I am because I'm an extrovert it

216
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,840
and they're a lot smarter than I am at
least I put them up there so it's kind

217
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,280
of interesting that they actually
classified introverts as being people

218
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,329
minded many were left to die in
hospitals being neglected but that's

219
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,610
another story in US history alone

220
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,830
ok the you get put into a hospital
because your people minded and then all

221
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,920
the Sun what happens is they just the
stop feeding you taking care of you and

222
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,050
pretty much you for it you fade away in
lincoln illinois is hospitals fed

223
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,969
incoming patients built from
tuberculosis cows or towels house with

224
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,140
tuberculosis believing that if there
were genetically superior they would

225
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,370
have been immune to it

226
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,850
so this is what they were doing in the
United States the poor by by passing

227
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,090
laws in the united states allowed for
the for sterilization of certain

228
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,110
citizens deemed harmful to society
remember in the twenties we have a stark

229
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,240
maze as stock market crash

230
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
they put a lot of people out of you know
out of work that probably wasn't a good

231
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,069
thing you know for a lot of people that
could work

232
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:07,630
and just because they're poor on they
probably were sterilized are the

233
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,810
criminals they said that criminals
should be sterilized

234
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,660
this is the Roosevelt the way he
supported the movements or the test

235
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,100
Tesla forward and a few other people but
arm

236
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,240
well actually a lot of Notables and this
is another failure in history it's like

237
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,460
all these who's who's at the time

238
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,070
supported this in the United States
Armed basically criminals should be

239
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,330
sterilized and people minded piece will
should be forbidden to leave offspring

240
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,390
behind them and that was the president
the united states at the time that was

241
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,189
his belief

242
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,660
minority races the superior race in the
united states by the way before world

243
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,850
war two before the Nazi regime was
blond-haired and blue-eyed Nordic types

244
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,819
by the way I don't have blonde hair blue
I saw probably targeted to write this

245
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,860
white cap right hits home with me

246
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,690
united states eugenics intended to
subtract the blacks Indians Hispanics

247
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,240
Eastern European Jews and our killer
hair

248
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,599
hillbillies excited so how would the
United States and ports the eugenics

249
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,929
step one was the identified the
so-called effective family trees and

250
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:18,209
subtract them to life-long segregation
and sterilization programs to kill off

251
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,780
bloodlines seen stop was the step one
for the Nazi regime in World War two

252
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,940
ok so how do they do it we'll talk about
that a little bit but there's public

253
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,730
displays in contests that were out there

254
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,870
basically there was a bitter family
contest that was given out there and

255
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,500
basically what you're supposed to do is
prove that your bloodlines

256
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,500
we're actually not contaminated by any
means in order to win this contest and

257
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,240
contamination could mean a one blood
drop roll like that happen in Virginia

258
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,679
ok one of the one of the heads of
Virginia basically said that if there's

259
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,990
one blood drop that was african-american
or any one of those other races that are

260
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,950
not in order

261
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,680
you know and their ideals then you
basically classified as one of those

262
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,280
people that would be qualified for this
for termination

263
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,560
this included people that also and this
is this happened in Germany as well and

264
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,330
we're over to as he found out is when
they did their analysis on the on the

265
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,540
data if say your grandparents were
Jewish

266
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,520
but then your faith their faith change
to catholicism and christianity or

267
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,300
something like that then basically you
were classified for extermination

268
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,990
okay you don't have to be Jewish
yourself in fact there could have been

269
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,160
generations before you but again because
there's a one-block one blood drop rule

270
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,510
this stuff could happen so the term or
on itself was born out of the genex

271
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,220
movement and there's actually pamphlets
given a long it's almost like a medic

272
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,490
it's kind of like you can you think of
this . but it almost looks like a

273
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,580
schoolchild of a pamphlet arm and that
arise from another great word being an

274
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,510
idiot

275
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,050
ok eugenics in virginia on

276
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,510
we're talking a little bit about this
we're talking a little bit about

277
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,510
eugenics and stuff but believe me this
relates to technology

278
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,800
so just follow with me a little bit here
but eugenics in Virginia

279
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,429
there was a there's a big case it's out
there and you can research it yourself

280
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,490
but for spell and Oliver Wendell Holmes
went down to saying it's better for all

281
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,240
the world if instead of weight to
execute a generation of offspring

282
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:38,000
offspring for crying or to let some star
/ you know for in but what is it and

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,080
obviously I can't be an imbecile like I
am because i can't pronounce that

284
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:50,360
but on society can prevent those who are
manifested unfit from continuing their

285
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,199
kind

286
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,010
now what this did was basically this
ruling by oliver wendell holmes targeted

287
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,550
uh miss Belle and her pictures up there

288
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,620
she was she was 18 years old at the time
she had a child a couple years before

289
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,510
that and she was she was adopted by a
foster family and what happened was she

290
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,010
was raped by that one of the one of the
members of the possible family and they

291
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,940
said Walsh

292
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,740
here she is she has the mentality of a
nine-year-old and it was recommended by

293
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,810
the doctor that she gets sterilized she
was sterilized by oliver wendell holmes

294
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,310
decision and you can see the plaque
right there actually confirms that arm

295
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:38,929
and basically what happened was in
between 7208 thousand three hundred

296
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:46,430
people were sterilized virginia alone
between 1927 and 1979

297
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,290
Carrie buck

298
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,560
it was the person that's that's right up
there arm

299
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,629
she went down it is saying you did me
wrong you did this all wrong and I have

300
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,310
to I have to agree with her

301
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,429
they did wrong arm

302
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:06,800
this goes against the 14th amendment
basically when we talk about rights

303
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,680
the state does not have a right
according to 14-member a amendment to

304
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,760
enforce any law that she'll be a bridge
the privileges or immunities of the

305
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,840
city's citizens united states nor shall
any state deprive any person like

306
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,179
liberty or property without due process
of law nor deny to any person within its

307
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,540
jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws

308
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,310
so basically have a george carlin quote
right here is saying like rights you

309
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,179
know what are they

310
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,510
we only have privileges we end those
privileges

311
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,410
they're made up by the government they
change constantly and as we can see it's

312
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,890
changed and the good thing is i think
it's changed for the better

313
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:52,250
ok many states supported eugenics 1907
Indiana was the first one but they are

314
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,990
not the most offensive one even enacted
this plaque to try to you know kind of

315
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,270
come clean on it and basically the most
the most offensive was California

316
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,680
it was the third state that can enact
sterilization laws out there and

317
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,920
accounted for eighty percent of the
sterilizations nationwide

318
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,130
that's huge ok numbers declined of the
first sterilizations after World War two

319
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,390
but it continued

320
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,140
ok into the seventies and I have
evidence that actually continued into

321
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,670
the - 20 times

322
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:32,390
ok 20,000 forced sterilizations between
1909 and 1963 were conducted there were

323
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,070
people that supported this people that
were local to this region for himself

324
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,360
there's a whole study in and those books
before it for himself

325
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,750
I

326
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,030
help to supply the German army with the
fourth of their vehicles by the way GM

327
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,389
and mooney those guys were actually in
on it too

328
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:57,030
on Souls IBM they all received grand
cross the German eagle from Adolf Hitler

329
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,050
for the third right for supporting them
it off

330
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:07,379
Adolf Hitler of light one of Ford's
right into the most is called the

331
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,720
International jus circa of early
nineteen twenties and here's what the

332
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,550
head of Hitler's youth later had to say
about this and he was is actually later

333
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,940
the anti-jewish governor of Vienna as
well

334
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,680
the decisive anti-semantic book which i
read at the time and the book which

335
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,050
influenced my comrades was Henry Ford's
block the International jus overall

336
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,580
several many Americans receive the
Hitler's German Grand Cross

337
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,090
what did it do for immigration

338
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,480
well we kind of see if it's right now
we're trying to limit and integration a

339
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,720
little bit but it's a little bit
different on what they use statistics

340
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,920
and that scientists arrived to talk
about the different types of people and

341
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,440
their genetic defects

342
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,180
there is apple beta and beta test and
out ellis island that they perform there

343
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,320
were designed to confuse and basically
what they would do is give a task like

344
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,860
and they will give you pictures and say
okay what's missing out of this picture

345
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,979
and they will have like a bowling alley
and all they won't have a bowling ball

346
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,290
in it and i'll just have the pins and
everything

347
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,990
once the people going through Ellis
Island may never even seen a bowling

348
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,460
alley at that point in time you might
give a picture of a postcard and see

349
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,110
what's missing off this postcard

350
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,709
well most people at that time may not
have ever given it written on a post

351
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,740
parry or try to put a stamp on it and
that's what was missing

352
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,640
so based off of this

353
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,120
what they determine was 44 seven forty
seven percent of whites and and I don't

354
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,989
understand this either

355
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,030
like seven percentage use because I know
a lot of Jewish white people but that's

356
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,690
that's my ignorance I guess arm and
eighty-nine percent of Negroes

357
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,860
I deserved extermination so this is very
racially motivated

358
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:58,430
ok and it was like very it's almost like
the KKK like this movement to me in a

359
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,470
way i'm sure they had their their hand
in it

360
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,100
arm how does the defect there

361
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,540
detective defects the US Census the use
examinations

362
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,720
they use the contest like we talked
about the other side of curious baby

363
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,590
contest

364
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:17,389
ok who secures baby who gets the win IBM
actually had the whole earth machine

365
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,490
I and that that was basically right here
we can see that

366
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,970
devonport was a person that worked with
Carnegie it for four county with with

367
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,460
Carnegie money and he was performing at
jamaica and cross study and this is

368
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,300
probably the first evidence right here
of them actually coding out like how to

369
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:44,389
go ahead and calculate arm the the
percentage of people that actually had a

370
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,250
Jamaican mixture in them

371
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,750
ok so they use that they use business
machines

372
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,860
ok they requested records from
infirmary's and prisons and then trace

373
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,240
the back to the families

374
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,320
IBM the solutions company had a solution
for everything

375
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,030
the still to this day are considered the
solutions company they have never shake

376
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,970
that that impression because they
provide solutions

377
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,070
ok they also provide a solution to get
off Hitler and this is where we start to

378
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,570
get into the technical

379
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,429
ok so we can see Adolf Hitler here with
Thomas J Watson and everybody probably

380
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,600
heard about Watson computer how smart it
is face up there they're sold the so

381
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,230
proud of

382
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,050
Watson and his history and the company
and moving it forward because he was a

383
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,550
very aggressive leader

384
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,850
and he got involved in a lot of
different countries it wasn't just

385
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,830
Germany but arm and he made sure that
there is a difference in cities and

386
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,970
everything else out there but 1932 they
began their tops

387
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:48,350
basically in 1932 what they are talking
about at these medians was like the

388
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:53,300
first thing that Adolf Hitler said is
how to identify the Jews get a month

389
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,560
multi prong solutions that had to that
had to be followed and he had a process

390
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,580
that he wanted

391
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,220
I p.m. to integrate with and every step
of that process including until the

392
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,210
final solution

393
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,330
does anybody know what the final
solution was yes

394
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:18,800
execution exactly so first first product
was find on the second the second part

395
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,710
of the process was to all stem from
their jobs

396
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:27,440
ok and from every segment of society and
this included again this wasn't just the

397
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,300
people that are currently Jewish this is
like anybody had a Jewish bloodline arm

398
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,600
IBM work to identify where they worked
ok

399
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,520
our to pulverize the Jews IBM work to
with the banks to identify their

400
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,100
accounts to speed up the process and
organization basically IBM work to

401
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,740
identify and the to and from addresses
that they would move juice from there

402
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,390
look they're nice houses to the low and
very low and rent districts

403
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,820
then they worked on the deportation of
Jews the camp so I being work to

404
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:09,080
identify the exact number of trains the
box cars etc so brings us to another

405
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,010
timeline

406
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,210
ok in 1910 there is a

407
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,180
german subsidiary setup of IBM and it
was established in 1928 the IBM

408
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,510
Hollerith punch cards were used for the
jamaican race study

409
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:28,730
you've seen the program that was listed
out in the other slide 1932 IBM

410
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,130
partnered with Hitler Usher and in the
information age in 1933 IBM in New York

411
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,870
instructed german subsidiary is to
design a massive German census

412
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,320
- identified use origin location and
professions

413
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,720
at that point there and throughout the
whole war the the German regime rented

414
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,570
the machines from IBM through a cemetery

415
00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:01,310
ok in 1939 the war broke out in
September of 27 and IBM quickly rushed

416
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:06,919
to combine the German Australian and arm
and Russian firms

417
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,160
LOL russian armed and then in 1942 the
u.s. entered the war at that time Watson

418
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,140
ordered the check machines to be put on
the put on the tags for the Nazi

419
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,830
tabulators and so did they stop

420
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:27,590
no they kept on going even after the
United States entered the war even the

421
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,030
tattoos and I'm sure as people probably
have seen the tattoos of the people that

422
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,500
were unfortunate enough to be put into
camps over in Nazi Germany but even the

423
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,670
tattoo started out its data found punch
card machines and tracking those their

424
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,320
professions etc

425
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,970
ok and that's how they knew what they
can do

426
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,720
ok this is usually a code or something
that's put on their arms they knew what

427
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,290
profession they were so if i had a coded
private cybersecurity computers and I

428
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,600
probably do something analytical on this
is the picture of the machines and this

429
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,899
was actually at the Smithsonian and this
is what started

430
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,880
mr. black on his research for trying to
find out what this machine was used for

431
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,540
ok and on this

432
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,159
so what they would do is they had their
subsidiaries and IBM would go over and

433
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,330
services machines and they would fix
them they would program them and do

434
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,889
whatever they were told to do

435
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,149
ok by the german government

436
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:30,129
however let's flash forward to here and
now we have a social media who were out

437
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,139
there sucking information

438
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:37,059
ok we have facebook we have twitter we
have everything you think about anything

439
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:40,330
that you put in out there there's big
data that's going to take that

440
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,580
information and go ahead and they're
trying to figure out right now

441
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,859
how to correlate that information ok now
is the government and honest now are

442
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:53,139
they going to try to do something like
this get

443
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:56,498
I hope the guy they don't ok that was
history then

444
00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:00,070
and the whole point of going about
eugenics and talking about the eugenics

445
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,330
process and all the stuff that had
happened back then is the let you guys

446
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,789
know that this stuff that occur and yes
it actually did they did use IBM

447
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:14,049
Business Machines they did use computers
and what we're doing right now here now

448
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:16,869
is we're giving everybody all the data
they need

449
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:20,619
ok not only that they're getting more
data ok

450
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,709
they don't have to worry about the
one-drop blood drop roll now they can

451
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,159
get inside your minds because now they
know your likes your dislikes everything

452
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,759
else so I think it's all over

453
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:36,099
no there's still people out there and
subsets and this is like kind of

454
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:40,239
concerning to me from 2006 - 2010 at
least a hundred forty eight female

455
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:46,779
inmates at to California facilities head
tubular legation surgeries which is you

456
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,889
know they were fixed

457
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:52,899
if you want to call it fixed without
consent and there's a whole process on

458
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,629
this that they did not follow at these
two prisons

459
00:31:55,629 --> 00:32:00,908
the process involves people actually
going out to the courts the the prison's

460
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,729
of cells going out to the courts to
prove that these women wanted to be

461
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:09,249
actually sterilized and they never
followed the process he just did the

462
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:14,889
sterilizations and these women and this
happen in this in the last but you know

463
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:17,750
decade so

464
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,830
breezes current issues it's like you
know there's a lot of ethics problems

465
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,689
with this with this whole scenario right
here and on current issues right now

466
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,030
that i see in the government

467
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,910
it's really F concerns on Electronic
Frontier Foundation which I support and

468
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:40,160
I the united states federal court any in
Virginia rules that they don't need a

469
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,870
warrant to hack into your computer

470
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,129
well this is even more information and
more eyes into what we're doing

471
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:51,800
so this is why it's a current concern
arm the criminal defendant who has a

472
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,090
reasonable expectation of privacy in his
own does not have a reasonable

473
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,449
expectation of privacy and their
computers basically what they're saying

474
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,950
and this is at anybody hear about FBI
playpen

475
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,330
I don't know why they give these like
terms this so here's the thing is like

476
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,139
the government and I see this time and
time again the government uses a motion

477
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,480
to try to go ahead and facilitate change
and we've seen it before with the FBI

478
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,120
and the and the phone the iphone

479
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,520
I you know it what the what was it
called the terrorists and and San

480
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,570
Bernardino case

481
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,830
ok but we've seen it before and they're
trying to play off of motion it's like

482
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,879
okay we hate terrorists here like all
most Americans don't like terrorists ok

483
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,200
we can probably agree on that

484
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,290
so what they're going to try to do is
like bring up a situation like that to

485
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,970
try to go ahead and sway public opinion
to get them more control again you know

486
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,000
this is not about privacy and security
this is about control

487
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:54,200
ok and liberties and the same things
happening here with play pan as far as

488
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,520
my home opinions

489
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,450
nobody's going to go out there and say
okay I want somebody especially father

490
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,440
like myself

491
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm not sand that I would want somebody
that is actually going to one of these

492
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,470
child pornography sites to be out there
and amongst my children but what I'm

493
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,969
saying is they're using this type of
stop to try to sway public opinion so

494
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:22,189
that they can go ahead and create laws
that say we have no reasonable

495
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,470
expectation of having any kind of
privacy in any of our devices Senate

496
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,730
still considered a given FBI

497
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,649
more power to spy on browsing history
for the other data this is a separate

498
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,629
issue but this would give the FBI the
ability to serve companies with the

499
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,389
National Security Letter to obtain
browsing histories

500
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:45,510
so we're talking about ISPs so what are
you doing at home

501
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,080
we'll find out if you want more and more
data they're trying for that more and

502
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,310
more data and this is a simple
relationship between governments and us

503
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,720
in general is they got to prove that
their sovereignty and they could protect

504
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,290
us

505
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,160
ok and for their minds this is what
they're trying to do but if you look at

506
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,690
the history of FBI

507
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,170
by the way does anybody know whoever
does anybody really know that a history

508
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,090
of over and all the stuff that he used
to do you don't want mover to be

509
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,940
President and he wasn't a really nice
guy

510
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,090
as far as that's concerned he had a lot
of dirt on a lot of people and he was

511
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,660
able to manipulate those people to do
things they wouldn't normally two faced

512
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,549
off of the data he obtained from mom

513
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,560
ok so we have a big failure of people
and ethics in this whole nation in

514
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,460
general

515
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,790
so that's really concerning to me when I
see that like the FBI sex you're trying

516
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,859
to push through yet another bill

517
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:39,180
this would give the FBI the ability to
serve companies we talked about that and

518
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,319
there's more information here at the eff
you can follow the eff you find more

519
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,000
information with that in general

520
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,100
so how we sold our souls and this is
something that Bruce did a good article

521
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,680
on is how we sold our souls to the
Internet giants and he's talking about

522
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,669
basically the Samsung television in that
article and I did some research outside

523
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,540
of his article and basically i found
this article from CNN money

524
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,020
it says many samsung tvs smart tvs are
come equipped with voice recognition

525
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,630
which allows you to park commands at UTV
since the television is always listening

526
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,100
for your voice

527
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,140
samsung has a worn-in to its customers
and every word is being captured and

528
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,640
sent over the internet

529
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,299
this is like really messed up to me
without dropping the f-bomb on the

530
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,680
reason why is i remember this one little
book that really I picked up and kind of

531
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,270
put down and read within a day

532
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,050
does anybody know what that is and it
started out with a TV with a camera and

533
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:43,830
was it 1984 by george orwell and boy did
he ever predict the future

534
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,580
busy you know and this was written what
back in what this is like forties or

535
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,840
early

536
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,230
yep 1940 ok 48

537
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,530
late late ok late forties ok

538
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,950
and the reason why I think he had a
perfect road map

539
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,540
he's seen all this other stuff we talked
about that we might have forgotten every

540
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,450
woman's hold through our own educational
systems

541
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,460
uh about how the government actually did
manipulate data now again they a lot of

542
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,120
eugenics

543
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,009
genex was first born in the UK but even
after those studies from Carnegie came

544
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,910
out the UK actually said ok we're not
going to even give any attention this is

545
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,470
like racial bowl

546
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,730
bullshit and I kind of just like
discounted it and it made me the

547
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,070
American eugenic scientists look really
bad

548
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,420
by the way it wasn't just like something
forward and stuff like a Rockefeller

549
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,220
actually supported Germans by sending
over money overseas to actually go ahead

550
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,049
and help their scientists

551
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,660
go ahead and do more studies on and
eugenics themselves to actually get it

552
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,140
I guess down to some kind of
pseudoscience which is like really

553
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,190
messed up

554
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,240
another thing we got we're not only
happy with going ahead and buying

555
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,740
devices that may have cameras and we got
Barbies now that will record the child

556
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,020
responses and so on to third parties

557
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,170
this is something that Bruce to put out
there you know as well and that and that

558
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,220
other things so we may also share it
goes this article that was reading

559
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,660
we may also share feature extracted data
and transcripts that are created from

560
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,339
such recordings but from which any
personal information has been removed

561
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,230
with the service providers or other
third parties for their use and develop

562
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,540
intestine and improving speech recognize
him but you know this is all kind of

563
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,350
strange

564
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,980
you get the video cameras we all know
about that on the street we see video

565
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,290
cameras all time I grew up in a world

566
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,500
look you up in a world I can tell by its
hair color that

567
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,940
but we grew up in a world some of us
where we don't have cameras anywhere

568
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,080
and this is like really strange to me I
don't like it ok I'm cyber security

569
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,700
expert but I don't like all these
cameras i don't like all these devices

570
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,399
out there and it really concerns me when
they can actually go ahead and track

571
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,000
different on different license plate
numbers as it moves through

572
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,900
intersections different cities and told
me where i'm actually at by the way

573
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,270
don't you need that because I got
stingrays

574
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,910
ok hail storm and stuff like that and
everybody knows about stingrays and

575
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,730
hailstorms basically the United you

576
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,650
United States law enforcement's ok not
ever raise your hand so basically I the

577
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,340
FBI told law enforcement agencies based
off the research that I've actually

578
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,700
discovered like months months maybe
years ago when i first heard about it

579
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,879
but I told that they told him not to let
let people know what these devices are

580
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,200
really truly capable of and basically
they can go ahead and track different

581
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,919
people but when they turn them on and
they actually start to collect the

582
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,690
information for where somebody's phone
maybe they're actually going ahead and

583
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,870
click again gather data from like
everyone in the vicinity

584
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:52,620
ok so that raises some privacy concerns
in general and there's also different

585
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,950
types of plugins you can use those
devices to extend those pictures that's

586
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,660
way beyond their so the whole point of
this though is just to bring out that

587
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,040
oakland county has one

588
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,230
ok and when i did some research and it
said like the FBI was and I don't have

589
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,660
the document here but it was posted
online

590
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,980
it was basically the transcripts of the
approval of hail storm which is a

591
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,870
stingray device armed

592
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:21,870
I think it's by is it a hopper and
technologies ok and then basically arm

593
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,089
what what happened was they want before
the Oakland board that they said we need

594
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,270
this to go ahead and and track bad
people

595
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,750
that's all they said they did not say
exactly what the device could do the

596
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,710
full capabilities or nothing like that
and they got to push their approved and

597
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,770
they got and they in the purchase the
hailstorm device

598
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,450
so here's the thing out of this article
it says open counties

599
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,609
uh

600
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:51,799
as letting the basically the publicist
publication

601
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:56,299
public public sighs information that's
been out there saying that they have

602
00:40:56,299 --> 00:41:01,279
hail storm has basically led to exactly
what it was hoping to a boy

603
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:05,480
public knowledge and debate about the
existence of the proprietary of the base

604
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,450
of halestorm technology in the hands of
law enforcement

605
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,019
so I want to highlight that they didn't
want us to know about this

606
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:16,789
ok they were instructed by the FBI to
not let us know about it

607
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,599
they pushed it through the board didn't
question it because why why would the

608
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,900
board question it a lot of boards don't
even know much about technology we know

609
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,710
that

610
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,130
ok they rely on us they rely on down

611
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,119
okay to tell them what this device does
and when they don't tell them everything

612
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:32,989
about it

613
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:37,819
they just go ahead and prove it so we
got a little pretty apps on our phones

614
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:43,339
and stuff like that well some of those
apps like angry birds heavily II phones

615
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:48,650
and apps that actually go ahead and give
you details including age location and

616
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,269
sexual orientation

617
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:54,799
ok and we saw this stuff on our poem
because it's like a good thing to do it

618
00:41:54,799 --> 00:42:01,038
right because it's fun it's not limited
to the angry birds but its study by

619
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,089
carnegie mellon institute says that
about every three minutes on average

620
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,598
there's different apps that are going
out there is saying where your location

621
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:14,150
as so they're tracking yeah and we
elected to do it because we carry these

622
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,269
ok I'm no better than you

623
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,299
machine that couple

624
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,900
um good luck on that though because that
is gold

625
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,900
I'll just add more storage because most
people expect to limit on how long your

626
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,050
records of their activity are actually
stored

627
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,610
even now as we speak united states
government is actually build the

628
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,440
facility with like multi path of lights
that I think it's not Utah or something

629
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,220
like that

630
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,899
Brian you have to get forward and
something to me and that he's mine

631
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,170
it's been a while it's like a year or
two ago but it out you thought they

632
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,660
might even have a built by now

633
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,109
yeah twenty six petabytes add Hoover

634
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,670
ok they're collecting our data on
current issues again

635
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:07,430
FBI is pushing for more power and
control via magistrates to allow them to

636
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,950
issue warrants outside of their
jurisdiction

637
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,870
this is a change to rule 41 of the
federal rules of Criminal Procedure this

638
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,490
rule change could in this is what the
senator said is this rule change could

639
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,569
potentially allow federal investigators
to use one more into access millions of

640
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:29,960
computers and it would treat the victims
of the half the same as the heck as the

641
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,310
hacker games themselves so basically
you're saying by going ahead and doing

642
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,150
this

643
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,770
I want you but I'm going together all
their stuff too and how well we got all

644
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,240
the data same thing it

645
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,419
why would it be any different than how
slow they are collecting everybody's

646
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,320
data anyway when they open it up so I
like this

647
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,590
this quote from George Carlin I did edit
it a little bit cause I don't want to

648
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:55,490
like put too many f-bombs my
presentation on that way but on

649
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,000
sooner or later the people united states
or this country are going to find out

650
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,260
that the government doesn't give a blank
about the government doesn't care about

651
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,090
you all the air interested in is keeping
and expanding their own power and -

652
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,590
case in point I'm not trying to say like
I'm anti-government i love our

653
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,420
government but i'm very concerned with
it I'm also concerned with the people

654
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,890
that are given our current on Election
choices but arm

655
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:29,529
anyway what I am saying is that the
government it stopped again to prove its

656
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:38,950
own worth self-worth has to go ahead and
keep its power and expand their power to

657
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,379
try to go ahead and prove itself

658
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,440
internet surveillance we are under mass
surveillance

659
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,609
you are being tracked everywhere you go
by companies and data brokers it can

660
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:52,359
have 10 or more companies attached to
one website and how many people run no

661
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,140
scripts

662
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,170
ok we're not scripts or anything like
that

663
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,829
well you know this ok you hit one
website you have all these other scripts

664
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:03,039
and sometimes you allow one and then
another 20 pop up

665
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,309
it's like we're gonna hold this all come
from I never even seen it that's looking

666
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,920
if you're not running that you should
run that and try to figure out how to

667
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,729
use it

668
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:14,410
okay because that's a great way to
really look at all this data gathering

669
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,700
that is being done to you

670
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,910
that's what you're browsing the web big
data can be used for the good and bad

671
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:23,859
so there's so much data already
collected about us the big issue is how

672
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,779
do you get any value out of it

673
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:29,200
big data is the solution to that and
this is the current here now

674
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,629
ok just like that just like the Nazi
regime had regime had a sense that they

675
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,410
had a compile and try to figure out
where everybody was a big data is that

676
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,890
solution out there to convert higher
levels of volumes of data and a low

677
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,479
density data that's valuable information
and it can take tens of territory tera

678
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:51,460
bytes into you know and in it can
process tens of terabytes into the

679
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,509
petabytes worth of data and that's what
we're talking about is processing that

680
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:56,380
much haha

681
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,340
by the way

682
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,120
as we're actually and this is what i'm
seeing out there as we're actually

683
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:07,700
losing it seems like the battle more
rights or at least it seems like it

684
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:13,040
because FBI NSA and all these people are
out there trying to buy for more power

685
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,810
we're having different corporations
we're losing on another side is like

686
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:22,190
Apple is working on ways to shut down
cameras and movie theaters this is all

687
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,840
like okay wait a minute

688
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,560
how does this benefit and Hutch you know
maybe want to take a picture of our

689
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,290
friends like sitting in front of that
cool movie poster to show that we're

690
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,750
actually there but now they're gonna
shut it down

691
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,590
why because corporations have the power
in America you don't we know that

692
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,650
ok and I it's time to wake up

693
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,980
we know if you if you don't I mean I
think a lot of people through probably

694
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,510
aware that at least more generous was
Apple is working on ways to turn off the

695
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,250
iphone cameras in certain locations this
all stems from like concerts taking

696
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,740
pictures and concerts and stuff like
that again

697
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,129
corporate money ok corporate tots

698
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:01,310
by the way it's a corporate and
government atlantis and the freaking

699
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,410
mess with you Janet's ok

700
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,799
and they try to bury that craft back in
World War two

701
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,830
after it happened after they liberated
the camp and they see how many people

702
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,880
are dead

703
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,420
they tried to bury it all and they
didn't what

704
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,260
your online image projected about you
well even though we're so concerned

705
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,040
important as other few research things I
come across stuff like this

706
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,470
fifty-six percent of adults surveyed
don't actively think about the

707
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,290
consequences of your online activities
these are thoughts

708
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,620
these are you think it's okay kids you
can just like it's right through the

709
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,160
three through the ground is probably one
percent probably thinks about what they

710
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,330
pose no it's probably about twenty
percent but anyway you know you get the

711
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,720
picture and there's consequences to this
and this is from Microsoft was worried

712
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,520
so this leads me to the conclusion that
since most people don't really give a

713
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,190
crap that was all going to repeat itself
again

714
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:59,560
ok arm George Carlin I usually try to
end on a positive from the hope with

715
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,810
george carlin's once said that you're
all screwed up and I like to turn it

716
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:09,070
like think of it from that standpoint
because unless people really start

717
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,630
caring about it and unless we're ready
to give up her conveniences arm

718
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,840
we're going to still continue to be
trapped track by the way what's the

719
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,320
biggest rage that I heard about and I do
realize this before it came to converge

720
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,360
yesterday and I spoke for the first time

721
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,090
what's the biggest thing out there
that's being talked about right now the

722
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,050
app

723
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,750
what the hell is it doing this is
geocaching it's tracking

724
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,990
it's like you it's like we're frickin
sheep

725
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,279
we're just going around like little
people doing things and have fun

726
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,700
and by the way it was every where we're
going and where you feel comfortable

727
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,680
going all these locations

728
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,980
by the way I'm saying this kind of
tongue and cheek it away because you

729
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,320
know what I was an ingress player

730
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,910
yeah i got to level eight I had all the
cool weapons and shit but you know what

731
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,319
I gave it all up like you know it's like
it a lot of this stuff is it's pretty

732
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,180
messed up so we have to question the
trade when people think there's a

733
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,970
trade-off via privacy versus security

734
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,839
we have to realize that's not really the
question it's a buttercream zones

735
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:17,410
ok versus control I when it comes to
encryption is your friend but is only as

736
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,350
good as the device and the key that
you're actually use and so if your

737
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,430
device stinks

738
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,089
ok and they could break into another way
and circumvent that encryption

739
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,930
well obviously that encryption doesn't
really do you any good

740
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,899
and if you lose a key because you told
your friend like I told brian over there

741
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,290
my password or something like that and
he blasted out of the world

742
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,650
then it's done you know you break great
into my stuff

743
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:45,069
so follow support the eff ACLU they seem
to be pretty good people for the three

744
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:49,450
most recent coverage others also website
out there how to disappear online if

745
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,790
you're really worried about the data
that's out there there's ways

746
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:55,089
you don't need to buy services there's
ways that you can actually research and

747
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:59,529
try to figure out how to cover your own
tracks to try to cover its a 2 to do

748
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,559
things like that one of my big favorite
things that I like to do is start this

749
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,950
this information out there and the
reason why i like to do that is because

750
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,220
maybe i'll pull something like I love
hope your mom go

751
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,990
ok so that somebody comes up to me says
hey I love pokemon going to try to

752
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:16,720
social engineer me it's not going to
work and I know I want to kind of know

753
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,009
where it came from

754
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:23,230
you know because I don't love pokemon go
but now people know that so screwed

755
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:28,720
so here's the observations we made so
its privacy versus security we gave some

756
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,470
statistical observations governments and
corporations you've seen how they failed

757
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:37,839
the best way that we can actually and I
think I actually you know what screw it

758
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,140
i'm going to end on a positive no you
know why cause I think there's a

759
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,200
positive note here and just really just
occurred to me

760
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,069
arm governments and corporations ethical
failure

761
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:53,410
the biggest thing that I seen when i was
teaching at colleges and universities is

762
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:57,910
this and i'm not saying this it's not
bullshit and i truly believe it is this

763
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:02,140
new generation rocks in the way that
they questioned every fucking thing and

764
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:07,598
thank God for them because you know what
youre sheeple if you're not okay and

765
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,510
that's cool because i'm open the guy
that they're going to question

766
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,750
everything and that's one of the ways
that you can do it

767
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,980
question authority ok because authority
has failed us

768
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:23,230
traditionally they try to cover it up
but that's it that's the end thank you

769
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,360
for attending my talk I hope that it was
like worthwhile

770
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,360
so

771
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,200
huh any questions

772
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,320
ok I don't know how much time I have
pokemon go

773
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,000
do you think it's got it so it's a fad
you know but there's going to be people

774
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
are three point four years you know that
someone

775
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,570
yeah what yes sir

776
00:51:53,320 --> 00:52:10,360
interesting

777
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,050
it was what

778
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,549
it's only that one district it's usually
the case yeah

779
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,760
the district they don't need to say I
don't know

780
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,790
that's news to me that's called a no go
ahead

781
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:55,870
both mhm no I don't think it's going to
stop

782
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:59,740
I think people are going to continue to
use it i mean we we have on her tana on

783
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,839
windows we have a whole bunch of
different

784
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,750
that's it seems to be the movement is
people want to make voice commands that

785
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,190
you like the star track

786
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:11,470
like like like the TV show i used to
watch right where you can just say

787
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,859
computer on and the computer just power
on and stuff like that

788
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,820
they like that idea and it's through our
own laziness is that will be our own

789
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,630
demise

790
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,630
okay anybody else yeah

791
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:28,870
any first steps

792
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,839
let's get some it

793
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,220
first step is I think to research the
issues that are out there are trying to

794
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:40,770
get more in tune with again the eff the
ACLU see where the failures were see

795
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,190
where they can where they could lead to
our do

796
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,490
history is a big friend of mine is a big
part of years but to do due diligence

797
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,300
you may have to go outside and what
you're going to have to go outside the

798
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,100
united states history books are you know
everything in this country isn't all

799
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,830
that is like potpourri smells great

800
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,730
you know although i think the american
history books that we were all raised to

801
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:09,690
read along the way kind of course that
arm you know I i always use this quote

802
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,500
look what I have for girls and I try to
I try to bring them up on history and

803
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,010
the reason why is because i don't want
us to repeat ourselves but I use this

804
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,450
quote that arm

805
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,890
I remember I was talking to my daughter
she's 11 years old now no working and

806
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:30,720
our basic that the other ones 11 but arm
and I basically what you said to me was

807
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,299
like I said well what did you learn
today in history

808
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,210
she said she was learning history is
halfway i want to learn that what you

809
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,380
learned in history

810
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,100
she says I'm learning to remember the
Alamo I said I'm sure that I'm sure the

811
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,110
Mexicans well you know think about it
from the other sides of things you know

812
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:51,930
in question everything but arm is far as
security and privacy itself

813
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:56,700
there's there's there's a mixture of
information out there i would say get

814
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,859
involved with different communities like
myself

815
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,100
I support myself myself that's why I'm
here

816
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,240
but get involved like minded individuals
like that and they will help the guide

817
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,029
you along the way there's different
settings in your phones by the way I

818
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,630
phones actually walk in a way that they
come with a lot more settings for

819
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:16,680
privacy then the androids do right out
of the box and I've actually used ball

820
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,600
so I know but you know so you will find
out the little different things like

821
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,350
that and be curious you know go up I
devices go play with them

822
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,740
you know yourself and try to figure out
like how to limit geocache and data and

823
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,819
all that other stuff

824
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,180
no long way anybody else

825
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,190
I think we're getting pushed out

826
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,390
ok better thanks
