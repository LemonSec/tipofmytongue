1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
I there's about yourself i got up i want
to say this is my first talk ever again

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,360
so I'm pretty excited about it and
nervous at the same time

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,139
uh it's going to be great I'm doing
learning security the hard way

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,619
going from student professional student
to professional it's kind of hard

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,090
especially in fact i'm going to tell you
why and what you can do to fix up this

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,019
is intended for college students
especially you know people coming right

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:25,889
out of college

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,179
however i do any input from industry are
you know anything you can share with me

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,149
i would love to hear and i can add the
future or questions any time you can

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,340
stop me

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,230
so um as I said my name is Benjamin
Carol this is this is a college specific

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,099
talk

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,850
I recently graduated last month with my
degree in cyber defense from Baker

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,610
College Jackson in my time there

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,870
aye captain a successful CDC team we
competed for times you know we won a lot

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,489
so it

17
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,989
I have that background on me which is
really great now i'm going to talk about

18
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,099
the CDC later

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,099
it's something i think that should be
addressed at the college level

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,600
I while I went to college I also work
there

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,679
I work in IT at the college so I had the
administrative perspective and i also

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,189
talked a few times while they're so I
had the experience of being a student

23
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,789
and instructor and working with
administration at the college level

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,490
that's very unique and a lot of people
don't get that so you see the full

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,850
spectrum of what college actually is now
I work at a large utility our consumers

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,479
energy

27
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,030
I in turn there in the sock which is a
great experience

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,390
i recently moved to the critical
infrastructure side so I have a lot of

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,020
exposure to skate a system and you know
the energy side of the business as well

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,179
so what i'll be going over today is i'll
be going over the temple second life as

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,170
a college soon

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,189
what it's like as a professional it's
very different and I and how to bridge

33
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,750
the gap between the two as well as tips
from industry and for industry night I

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,750
think the floor industry the very is a
very good thing to add

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,600
so this is you're going to have a
starting point everyone security has a

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,690
starting point and I know for me and I'm
assuming a lot of other people

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,970
this will be your starting point you
know it's it's kind of what it is you

38
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,140
can be an IT security is way different
idea that's going to hurt you and and

39
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,420
everyone is going to look like that when
he gets very spot yet

40
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,690
yeah he loves what he's doing I i love
in for a second i hope i hope all you do

41
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,890
- so you're having a starting point and
i can tell you right now

42
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:39,619
colleges advertise in full sexy when I
went into the college

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,290
they're like yeah learn how to be a
hacker learn how to read team that

44
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,850
indicates that most colleges you use
they advertise hacking and being a red

45
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,120
team and stuff like that but then you
get there and what is it blue team and

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,420
you know looting matters in it and
that's what

47
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,540
for the most part you're gonna be one of
doing but they're blending the two

48
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,200
together right now in industry but
they're not in college you know they

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,140
advertise red team when you get there is
blue team

50
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,730
so there's there's confusion that happen
when you start school and I know that

51
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,160
because while I worked there at the
college

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,730
they had me advertise that specifically
to high schoolers you know

53
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,970
advertise the whole hacker thing get
people interested by doing hacking you

54
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,390
know I got people in my CDC team by like
a learn how to hack and then I switched

55
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,440
it on now if I hate not his routine you
know someone hated it hated me for it

56
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,290
but it was kind of the way colleges do
it which is unfortunate that I think so

57
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,940
get over that confusion and you'll be
set home and then as you keep going

58
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,160
you'll realize everything Theory that's
the same for all degrees there when you

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,239
when you do theory

60
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,450
even if you're doing hands-on work
nothing's gonna nothing can prepare you

61
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,929
for a ransomware attack nothing in the
colleges and be like hey you know you're

62
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,900
sitting in a sock ransom or just hits
you you can't prepare for that in

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,120
college so that is a huge gap that you
know theory are in in in college

64
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,550
you don't really want learning what you
can be applied in the real world and

65
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,989
then also I see a lot of students that
I've been or from Eastern i know from

66
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,160
Baker

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,420
there's some from JCC you're going to
Jackson college you're gonna you gonna

68
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:17,149
realize it's very competitive and i'm
going to say that's because of the CCDC

69
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:22,159
we will be created this culture that I
think it's inappropriate and needs to be

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,150
addressed and i will trust that later
but that's that's also another confusion

71
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,150
thing when you get into college

72
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,669
so as to keep going you're going you're
going to hit two points

73
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm sorry not gonna hit you . you
realize two things you start talking to

74
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,900
these other schools I made an effort to
to discuss things with other school and

75
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,138
that was those kind of a new things
people in school don't talk to each

76
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,460
other at the school so I talked to my
peers that I have now I realize there's

77
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,630
a business degree and security and
there's also a science degree

78
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,880
are there they both are advertised as
security degrees but they have two very

79
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,460
different focuses i took a more business
related degree so I learned policy and

80
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,299
procedure and I learned how to apply
security two things whereas some of my

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,450
peers have the more science related
security degree and they know how to

82
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,460
actually do that on a computer side

83
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,580
I don't know how to cope very well you
know I wish I did

84
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,880
I wish I took a science degree by the
same time I talk to people who did take

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,130
the Science degree and they're like man
i wish i had a business degree and then

86
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,919
I make it a policy and then i can apply
security

87
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,969
you know not just typing stuff is like
an engineer or something so you're going

88
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,820
to see that when you get out there and
if you realize that now if you realize

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,539
the spring of your degree if it's a
science degree or business degree pick

90
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,139
up what is lacking on your own but
that's going to help you in the long run

91
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,639
extremely and as you keep going strange
things are going to happen it's gonna be

92
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,889
wild and crazy and they're gonna
graduate

93
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,249
you're looking for a job and this is
going to be you know

94
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:58,309
that was me at least it's it's rock and
i would like to say that in my I want to

95
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,549
say my experiences this is related to
undergrads i just applied for my

96
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:05,628
Master's I i know and i will maybe add
to this the master's degrees in the

97
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:06,349
future

98
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,589
I'm sorry to keep going you're gonna
find a job going to get your job and

99
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,039
you're gonna realize there's a rapid
change the infosec community changes

100
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,099
every single day which is awesome

101
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:20,599
it's a challenge it's amazing it evolved
the nature of the beast it's it's great

102
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,169
but at the same time with that rapid
change what you have to deal with other

103
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,308
things you have to deal with maturity
that students you guys ever development

104
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,209
mature yet

105
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:36,019
yes interact you yes no yes you have a
fabulous dancer - 700

106
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,649
if you haven't dealt with that you're
gonna get in there you go , yeah

107
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,069
what is maturity you know you're going
to hear us say it you know people energy

108
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,889
say it but you're not going to know what
it is until you actually in it

109
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:53,089
so another thing with that is I I think
that's an issue across the industry as

110
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,319
far as you know I walked into an
enterprise which which was fairly mature

111
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,389
and you know we're working really hard
at it

112
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,709
so my challenge was learning the
maturity and learning how that apply to

113
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,219
us

114
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:07,699
I know people that have walked into
smaller smaller shops and ask them

115
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,360
actually you know build that maturity up
so we have is we have two separate

116
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,809
challenges on separate sides of the
scale but they're both equally as hard

117
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,409
so if you realize that in college and
it's going to hit you when you get to

118
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,188
your career it's that it's going to help
you

119
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:29,360
next you need to learn how to learn and
I i think this is very very important

120
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,860
for anything in life there's a lot of
people that don't know how to do that

121
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,949
you need to leverage what you know you
leverage the people around you and if

122
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,469
you learn that way use that I that CDC
team i created a very vocal about this

123
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:45,529
we did a student-centered learning
environment

124
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,360
our instructors were not involved at all
who competes in CCDC you raise your hand

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,959
please

126
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,580
ok this year's service your instructors
I'm help you every time you need

127
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,688
did they show you how to do things this
not

128
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,939
I know you guys Eastern I mistake
doesn't know

129
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,099
ok so arm I i know some colleges i know
some of the colleges they there they

130
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,900
have a crutch this instructor

131
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,620
so what happens is they get into this
this competition room and they don't

132
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,870
know what to do is instructor is not
there

133
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,750
whereas we what we did is we we learned
how we learned we learned it with each

134
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,069
other so we can apply it rapidly we are
presented with a challenge and we could

135
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,020
we can do it as quickly as we could

136
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,078
if you can apply that to your career
that's amazing i'm a great thing about

137
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:36,679
security and i hope you guys have been
here all we are all weekend

138
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,109
thursday is very cultured rhythm
security security is not a product and I

139
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,060
and in college

140
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,339
the advertised security product if not
is it's about the people and you asked

141
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,760
me and i think a lot of people in
industry will tell you that security is

142
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,140
about the people than the process and
then the product you need the people to

143
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,380
apply it on earth you the people to
build a process to apply to the product

144
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,329
they don't teach you that in college I
from the people I've discussed with in

145
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:08,719
college they don't show you that they
don't demonstrate that it

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,350
you're not in your head yeah yeah yeahs
it and then you get then you're like oh

147
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,529
wow I can't just buy something and throw
it in and everything is fixed

148
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,449
by the way this is it's about people in
the process and product is the lasting

149
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:29,839
so you can go into your career going to
hit realistic expectations are

150
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,009
I know a lot of people and I think I
think this is a issue on colleges in the

151
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,699
way they advertise and like I said I i
did all the tools for the high schoolers

152
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,269
in that you know the people from other
colleges and show them stuff and I was I

153
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,309
was specifically instructed to you know
a make it look sexy but be inflate

154
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,189
inflate the numbers you know when i was
in college i thought it was great and

155
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:53,509
now i'm out of college I think that was
a mistake there there's no starting

156
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,029
point at a hundred thousand dollars
unless you're a genius

157
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,050
you know you you need you need to
understand that even at 75,000 yet you

158
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,490
need to be looking towards like a 40 to
60 range which which is great by the way

159
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,259
don't be upset by that

160
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,230
well there's just a lot of people that
I've talked to that are expecting the

161
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,800
hundred-thousand-dollar range are
expected to fail fail utterly fail often

162
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,748
if you have a good manager

163
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:20,809
they're not love that you're going to
love that you know I I like being called

164
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,040
break fix

165
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,480
I know if you are Bray chris's if you
break something and learn from it and

166
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,529
then fix it and you you're not gonna get
in trouble yeah everyone going to fail

167
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,709
and you're afraid of failure because
your managers or your your team leads

168
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,050
and be like oh my god you failed you get
out of here

169
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,189
it's not the case and industry it
shouldn't be the case anywhere if you if

170
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,480
you fail and you learn from it

171
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,199
it's a great great thing and I know a
lot of people that expect to be mr.

172
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:52,910
robot when they walk in and watch mr.
robot great show great show i binge

173
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,939
watched it last week for the first time
and how it was great season too just so

174
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:05,420
don't you're not mr. robot that's
obviously television but industry is not

175
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,860
like movie hackers or black hat or
anything like that you know

176
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,819
normal is but

177
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,080
you can just click a button and things
happen but however i will give props to

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,310
to mr. robot and one great-great great
thing that they portray that no one else

179
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,569
is portrayed in the in the past and
that's research they actually showed him

180
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,710
researching people anyone in red team
will tell you that you know you spend

181
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,810
way more time researching your target
then you do actually doing things you

182
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,369
know it's like thirty percent doing
things and seven percent research and

183
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,750
documentation again another thing they
do not tell you in college they just say

184
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,910
hey go out and have fun attack us target

185
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,579
you know learn how to do that it's not
the case but while you what all the time

186
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,390
you spend in college and you're focusing
on your career and now you're in your

187
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,390
career you need a reason you need to
spend that time that you studying to

188
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,650
research new things

189
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,850
someone else in the sock our co-worker
mind to this malware analysis

190
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,910
I'm green as grass with our analysis

191
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,949
I love watching him to our analysis it
was interesting i was psyched about it

192
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,370
had no idea what I'm doing my research
in it in my spare time

193
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,790
yes I hope to apply that in the future
arm packet analysis again I did it more

194
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,050
business related degree

195
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,740
we're never going to packet analysis
yeah I know how networks but I track

196
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,310
down

197
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,569
you know i'll roll back or anything like
that now am i researching that my spare

198
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,140
time

199
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,240
yes you know so it's it's it's going to
help you in the future is going to help

200
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,540
your team you're going to benefit from
that a lot

201
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,060
and now and if your student you're going
to hate this next one when you're in the

202
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,859
industry you need to document everything

203
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,950
documentation is a scary scary word for
a student for me it was documentation

204
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:59,460
means extra work when i was in school i
had a by my junior year I had a motto

205
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,940
and my model with myrrh and still for
minimal effort required

206
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,510
- start to be like hey write a 7 to 10
page paper that's what he was getting

207
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,819
seven pages exactly

208
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,190
so when your industry that doesn't cut
it you you need to put in a lot of work

209
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,170
to that you know and again your future
self will thank you way more than you

210
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,740
know your current cell your team again
will thank you

211
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,020
your

212
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,230
your leaders will thank you because hey
now you documented this now you have a

213
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:32,770
process now we can apply to the rest of
the rest of the organization and we keep

214
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,290
moving anything through all those and
you know if you bridge the gap you do

215
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,680
all those you have success however i
define success

216
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,609
past that once you bridge that gap

217
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,330
what I think real successes I think real
success is creating new knowledge and

218
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,920
then giving that back to the community

219
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,670
so once you've done all those in your in
your in your job and you love it

220
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,209
please get a job you love by the way and
and if if you're doing all that

221
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,810
take the time to give back to the
community and to create new things

222
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,449
if you can do that you get out of it
what you put into it I hope you guys

223
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,630
have met my sick people and you know
anyone wearing red sure talk to them

224
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,860
that they're here to get back to the
community and I think that's a

225
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,250
successful thing to do

226
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,250
so I talked to two of my peers

227
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,319
the first person i talked to go back to
that so what I asked was uh what would

228
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,050
be what do people new to the industry
struggle with which is basically that

229
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,829
gap and what what is that gap and what
would you recommend security and focus

230
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,680
on before moving in history which is how
to bridge that gap

231
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,280
so the first person i asked was
generated torque she's a liaison to the

232
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,380
CBI academies are going to see the
Academy is

233
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,050
yeah okay they're here great people um
she's liaison so she's at the very very

234
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,640
low level they taken armed people are
they graduate and they do learning

235
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,230
program and they said you know they put
them in positions is awesome but she's

236
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,710
at this

237
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,890
the starting point so she gets the
students that are right out of college

238
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,680
sorry full exposure to the students are
right out of college and I I think she

239
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
gave me the best answer ever ask her

240
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,150
and that's that graduate struggle with
an entry point into info set

241
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,270
what is the entry point

242
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:15,270
I mean I don't really know you guys know
now I mean regular IT you started

243
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:31,740
you kept me go no kept putting it is on
the right menu

244
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:42,420
yes exactly and and to add to that out

245
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,839
avoid being an SME can you get
pigeonholed anything that's so fantastic

246
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,430
that do the jack of all trade trade up
but again with that entry point everyone

247
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,219
knows regular I to work on your
graduation i.t i.t degree you're gonna

248
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,970
start the help desk

249
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,480
it's the traditional route I started
helped us when you work up there is no

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,210
real IT security help help desk

251
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:05,580
I mean I'm sure they exist but that's
not a proper entry point into what it

252
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,810
should be , and then at the same time
you go looking for degree or you're

253
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,810
looking for jobs and what do they want
they want this much experience and this

254
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,189
much education for an entry-level
position that is bad

255
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,970
shame on those businesses but for the
record still apply to those jobs please

256
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,930
apply those jobs those those are HR
requirements you can get past those but

257
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,949
its cues your perspective of the entry
point they say all your energy .

258
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,070
requires five years of experience just
graduated college

259
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,910
about five years of experience you know
and the they advertise them as entry

260
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,400
points another struggle is information
overload and I think this is a big one

261
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,590
this this affected me a lot I walked
into again and enterprise

262
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,220
I had a lot to learn how to work
processes I don't wear their tools

263
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,380
they'll teach you specific tools and in
in college they're like hey here's what

264
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,500
a sim is can't tell you how to use a
specific soon

265
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,859
you know you have to learn that while
you're there so you get you get flooded

266
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,879
with all this information and it hurts
I'm are I got home before my wife is

267
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,550
sitting right there and she knows that
I've gone home before

268
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,909
but my brain feels like mush I couldn't
do anything because I take it in

269
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,430
I i took in so much information that day
and it hurt but it helped me in the long

270
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,430
run

271
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,890
yeah yeah i yeah

272
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,570
oh and then and then to bridge to help
bridge that gap

273
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,409
she told me get comfortable being
uncomfortable you're going to be putting

274
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,760
on compositions

275
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,470
it's gonna suck get through it I i think
i'm almost at the point of being

276
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,960
comfortable with it I'm not really i'm
uncomfortable right now and I think I'm

277
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,090
doing pretty good but uh it's please
please just get uncomfortable being

278
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,639
uncomfortable it you're going to get
through things

279
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,520
the there are challenges and it looks
like they're going to hurt you get for

280
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,240
them and then I also definitely have all
the basics down

281
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,370
that would include like networking
coding map please have Matthew please

282
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,169
understand how math works so people the
last thing i want to do I don't work for

283
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,860
cbi

284
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,540
however as an advocate of learning I
really like what they do and I want to

285
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,360
plug them real quick if if you're
looking for an entry point

286
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,600
you know one of my best friends with
them right now loves it the people there

287
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,889
are great talk to CBI talk to walk back
in a great people are the second person

288
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,420
asked was a gym beachy

289
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,910
he's the executive director of
information security of consumers energy

290
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,450
so we talked to JT was you know talking
to the people in college while they're

291
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,990
there now we have a high level overview
of what gym you know of a director what

292
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,040
a director whipping our students
struggle with

293
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,270
so he told me one of the gases is
realizing how much you don't really

294
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,200
don't know and I extremely appreciate
this response to the gym because that

295
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,650
was me I have to do not know I die I
thought I knew a lot and I walked into

296
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,610
that and I and a kid and obviously hurt
obviously I got hit with that

297
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,689
information overload

298
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,840
I was uncomfortable for a little while
have a great team there's some of the

299
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,030
back there there you know they helped me
through it but I I thought any more than

300
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,620
I did and it hurt

301
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,979
and another thing he said was you
understand that you don't know jack and

302
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,180
it's actually quote from him

303
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,570
however

304
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,750
that's ok that's a good thing that you
don't know anything

305
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,550
you know basics if you walk into a
business thinking you know everything

306
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,100
and then you go to a different business
and business is going to operate

307
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,120
differently

308
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,870
you need to have a basic sound and not
think that you know everything because i

309
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,750
did that and I start over good and you
know as you got to get you got to get

310
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,110
past that you got to understand that and
you if you do it's going to help you

311
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:50,500
and then lastly to bridge the gap work
work hard learn hard play hard

312
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,610
just dedicate yourself to becoming
better at what your job is

313
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,100
then it is it's great again your team
will thank you if you do that your

314
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,159
managers will the business will thank
you if you do that one last thing Jim

315
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,720
told me that I did not put on here

316
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,760
was he also added I'm not just colleges
but people moving from MIT

317
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,750
is anyone here working in IT and not
information security you're okay so one

318
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,640
of the struggles that he mentioned with
people in i.t i.t is focused on

319
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,600
availability

320
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,530
you know i'm working in SCADA systems
right now you know that they have to

321
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,350
stay up if they stay up if they go down
people's power

322
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,459
you know I'm still doing security but
way more availability focus where when

323
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,080
you move to information security

324
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,080
it's it's all about confidentiality and
that kind of thing that system single

325
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
gal you know we don't like that but it's
not the end of the world

326
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,570
you know so it's you have to realize
it's not availability

327
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,040
it's confidentiality and did that they
have the same focus priorities are

328
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,290
shifted any managers or any bosses in
hearing on

329
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,870
no that's okay hi one of things I want
to say to to them and I hope they watch

330
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,679
this is that you need to get used to the
Millennials you look around the room

331
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,730
there's a lot of us are we operate
differently

332
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,990
we grew up in the cloud we had the
Internet forever

333
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,480
are we were just different or digital
natives and I think walking into a

334
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,320
business

335
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,658
we have people that are older and and
and they aren't that

336
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:25,639
you you hit you hit a rock and they're
just like no no your Millennium I'm not

337
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:26,359
gonna help you

338
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,129
I just leverage what we have and and
we're good we're good we're good at

339
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:34,279
things and people don't realize that
they just want to put us in a hole and

340
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,940
just like hey you know it hasn't
happened to me but I've talked to people

341
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,769
that it has happened - so leverage our
skills and teaches the things we don't

342
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,940
know unless you need to support colleges
and and events

343
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,749
so you being here supporting this event
is amazing look I mean there's a lot of

344
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:51,950
students right here right now

345
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,859
so you're gonna be hiring them in the
future so and on other events that i can

346
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,478
three all if your student looking to my
second great community and i'm sure

347
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:05,989
you've met a lot of them and i know i
plug them already but that's that's

348
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:09,259
awesome support the CCDC we want to help
make that better

349
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,999
this National Cyber League you know that
starts with a high school team

350
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,539
can you imagine you know helping someone
in high school and through college doing

351
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,889
Cyber League and then you have them
trained what you want them and then now

352
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:22,969
they're working for you

353
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,749
so that's that's a cool thing to do and
there's a there's other events and stuff

354
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,700
my best advice however it would be
patience I know a lot of people that are

355
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,479
our nomination

356
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:39,950
our vision I was really impatient with
all these while you're in school finding

357
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,429
finding the right about end of the
tunnel this hurts it really hurts

358
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:48,139
just be patient with it again you'll get
out of it what you put into it when

359
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,158
you're looking for a job

360
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,190
you're gonna start to find the entry
point be patient with that as well

361
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,729
I know a few people that are struggling
with that right now and while you're in

362
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:56,359
your job

363
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,599
those processes that you're not exposed
to in college this way the ways

364
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,389
businesses work you have to be patient
with that and all of them are gonna be

365
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:03,109
different

366
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:09,830
the last thing I wanted to focus on what
the CCDC I i love the ccc

367
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,840
however on I i like to give constructive
criticism to it

368
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:20,239
I like what they do there's some ways
that there is supplied and I say CCDC

369
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,749
however i'm gonna stay the entire
collegiate landscape because it's not

370
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:28,789
just them it's the way colleges helped
build this is the way their culture is

371
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,049
done and i think it's i think it's not
watching the ccd

372
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:36,658
the CDC as it is the culture of the
colleges that are at NBC which is all of

373
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,559
you

374
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,039
first thing schools need to work
together

375
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,169
I mean yeah we mentioned playbooks if I
had friends playbook work so I want a

376
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,779
bigger college Jackson if I had bigger
college of friends playbook little

377
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:49,649
freaked out

378
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:52,889
they would they would absolutely hate us
they would do it be the worst thing ever

379
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:57,449
know make a playbook and share with them
what are you doing so what do you do

380
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,299
what are you doing an industry with
teams you know how many times you hear

381
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,690
Microsoft and Google working together to
fix an issue

382
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,299
you know you're going to be working
together in the future and what happens

383
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:09,570
is they don't inspire the right culture
while you're in college so you get you

384
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,899
get into your career and it's like oh my
god I don't want to work with them

385
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:15,299
they're an enemy you know

386
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,519
no that's not the issue so that's
another thing you'll be working with

387
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,970
your enemies again i'm from Baker
College Jackson

388
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,539
i'm working with someone from Jackson
college I love the guy he's great

389
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:29,279
and when I was in college he was an
enemy he's not anymore and and if you

390
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:36,059
guys it's if you guys learned that now
you're going to succeed quicker when you

391
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,470
get there and then you need

392
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,909
and again I i'm gonna i'm gonna switch
the side to collegiate landscape because

393
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,950
it's not the CCDC the business but we
need to focus on security as a whole at

394
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,330
the college level and again I say CC
because that's the people I'm exposed to

395
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,178
is in that in that realm but so when
target happened everyone boo target like

396
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,159
oh my god target you suck

397
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,049
no absolutely not what they did was they
put in place act as an industry the

398
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,149
industry failed not target

399
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:10,229
um you know and people people that
college at the college level you know

400
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,859
they would do another team or they would
do something like that I i I'm guilty of

401
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:14,279
it

402
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,520
you know are so

403
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,180
partly happened I wasn't you know as
well said I'm i'm young i was around my

404
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:27,000
heart what happened but that everyone
drop openssl know again corporate rivals

405
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,250
and enemies rally

406
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,380
i use enemies were lightly but they
rallied together to help build open

407
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,610
source security projects together you
know so so colleges can understand that

408
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,240
that would be a great thing and another
thing i want to add to this so i

409
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,490
competed for three years in the CC i
think i was unhelpfully driven to win

410
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,350
I wanted a trophy that's all I wanted
that's not the case anymore

411
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,170
i buy time I competed for my fourth time
I i think i do really good naturally

412
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,040
leading I didn't actually manage and i
was fortunate to have people helped me

413
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,780
learn that

414
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,720
so by time my fourth competition my
fourth and last competition came around

415
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,080
I got second place was I upset

416
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,470
absolutely not because the next week
everyone on my team came to me and they

417
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,720
said then I work for you in a heartbeat

418
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,270
you did you did this wonderfully we all
learn from the experience of ccd so I

419
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,870
again

420
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,919
I'm throwing a set at colleges because
everyone goes there to win a damn trophy

421
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,879
that's not what it's for you need to
learn what you're doing that that's

422
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,630
that's the most realistic experience
you're going to get outside of how are

423
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,330
you outside college that's what Kate you
right

424
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:45,840
you know so like the closest that's the
closest arm but you know they they have

425
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,090
their circles as well but if we work to
help them

426
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,240
it's going to be great and i would like
to help them in the future

427
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,840
you know - to further align that with
industry

428
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:01,230
so what I went over today is infosec
what what it's like as a college student

429
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,160
once like as a professional and then

tips for ministry and for industry and I

oh yeah yeah yeah

440
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:10,640
yep yeah absolutely

441
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,110
because they all operate the plane is
great yeah yeah go ahead

442
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,680
did i do an internship before any of
that I i did my internship the last two

443
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,660
semesters of my college degree so that
would then that was that was with

444
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,860
consumers energy

445
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,120
yep I worked I worked as an actual
faculty member for the IT department

446
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,560
when i was there for the college so but
yeah I did the industry

447
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm sorry I defended the internship
through Parkinson's

448
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:52,200
ok how r

449
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,570
they actually do tomorrow so ice

450
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,649
I do not have an answer to that yet yet
I want to throw that out there

451
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:07,408
I i think i think it's just as much a
struggle for millennia for people to

452
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:11,039
deal with Millennials as Millennials
idea what the older generations would

453
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,220
you do that

454
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,980
yeah sure sure but I

455
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,980
I don't have an answer for every know
and I I that's a very good question

456
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,070
tolerance that's a good one yes and
again I think every business is

457
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:34,168
different and it is way related to the
person and how they view them

458
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,760
yeah you have to find a balance yeah
yeah because again there's a very I i

459
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,230
think the biggest part of the millennium
system of communication gap and and and

460
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,639
i think it takes both sides of the
generations to work to fix that triggers

461
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:53,428
when someone prolly college oh yeah

462
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,940

463
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:15,000

interact a little sauce work with people

464
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,740
