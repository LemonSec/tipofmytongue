1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
all right hi everyone so this is a how
to build a home lab and quick

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,670
introduction and a couple of points
before we proceed

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,230
so this was originally conceived as a
four hour workshop for circle city con

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,960
and I was asked to bring it here as well
so but we don't have four hours so i can

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,080
sense a lot of material into a one-hour
talk

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,630
so what we cut out the demos and I and
cut back on some of the really

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,439
nitty-gritty technical details i'll be
happy to answer questions afterwards or

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,940
at the end if we have time

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,500
I cover a lot of the stuff we need to
get started and that you'll need to to

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,530
get up and running but if you do have
any questions feel free to come up to me

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,640
afterwards or again if we have questions
at the end

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,800
happy to answer any of them this was a
originally a partnership with myself and

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,968
Timothy to block

14
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,629
unfortunately Tim couldn't be here this
weekend he just started a new job which

15
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,230
is awesome for him but it also means
that uh you know they don't often want

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,489
you leaving the state and taking a week
off right after you start a new job so

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,840
you could make it out to converge this
year now but for I know he would want me

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,290
to point out that you can find him at at
Tim the block on Twitter and he is our

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,780
executive producer for PVC sec which I'm
also one of the co-host for and he used

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,850
to be he helped start up before he moved
to South Carolina I Cola Cola sex so if

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,850
you know someone out that way out
columbia south carolina

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,869
there's a great group out there and Tim
also does the exploring information

23
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,159
security podcast or he'll he's taking a
break right now he starts his new job

24
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,299
but if you go back and look at the fee
there's lots of great interviews and

25
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,970
discussions with various people from the
community

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,149
we did a really great I can historical
look back with move Ock's and ms 867

27
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,380
which is pretty cool and then for myself
my name is chris Molina

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,880
tim was a blue team side of this talk
I'm the red team side

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,140
so a lot of my example would be red team
focused but this is totally applicable

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,200
whether your blue team or red team we're
going to talk about how you can use your

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,460
lab for

32
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,310
learning all kinds of things even if
it's not something you do in your day to

33
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,410
day

34
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,770
so this is like I said for everyone

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,800
you don't have to be a a pro

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,010
you don't have to already be up and
running with virtualization software you

37
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,850
don't even have to know what a BM is I
will cover all of that and it's pretty

38
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,400
easy to get started from the ground up

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,780
it's easy to add stuff to your lab so it
doesn't matter what your what your level

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,540
of activity is if your student if you're
just getting started searching for

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,620
another industry

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,160
I their stuff in here and stuff you can
do with the home lab that will be really

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:49,590
beneficial to you again for red and blue
and the key thing here to the key thing

44
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,060
I want you to take away is kind of this
sweet i wind up from Dave Kennedy is

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,790
that everyone is new to something

46
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,709
the home lab will help you experience
new things things that you can't see in

47
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,370
your environment they might not normally
see things you only hear about you can

48
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,670
set up a windows machine that's packed
with a certain level and play around

49
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,540
with some new exploit if you're curious
how will affect machines back in your

50
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,320
environment or how you can a kak it
using that new vulnerability

51
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,519
I just about anything you can do I at
work

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,610
if you can't do it at work you can you
can do it at home and we'll talk more

53
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,230
about that a bit later but the key thing
is you don't need this

54
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,480
when I first got started I you did kind
of need that when i was getting started

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,260
with networking

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,730
you know the idea of setting up a home
lab did sort of require me to go out and

57
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,140
have like some spare desktop or an old
laptop or something and I was a poor

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,920
student I couldn't really afford and all
that extra hardware and I didn't really

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,540
have the space for its our the time to
set everything up but what's great now

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,760
is really just need one of these

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,709
whether you have a macbook windows
laptop even if it's kinda clunky you can

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:04,050
set up a really great home lab and do
stuff at home without having a lot of

63
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,660
powerful hardware and just taking up in
a quick snapshot of some of the hardware

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,600
that i use so I person i have a macbook
pro from 2015 with like five min giggs

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,190
the story it's a you

66
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,310
it's a core i7 16 gigabytes of RAM it's
fantastic for running VMS on the other

67
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,560
side of things tends satellites

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,760
I get the windows laptop toshiba
satellite more storage and I 7 as well

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,440
only eight gigabytes of RAM

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,460
I and when it comes down to it the
hardware you don't really need anything

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,239
all that beefy you're going to be
limited in some way but only eventually

72
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,050
so every time you send up the animal
talk about allocating resources in a

73
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,010
little bit for your bm's but really as
long as you have a spare core on the

74
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,000
processor and need one for your actual
host operating system and then probably

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,350
at least one for each your bm's if you
have enough kors that's really the only

76
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,490
limit on how many bm's you can have
running is just how much you want to

77
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,700
deal with it if you don't have enough
memory and you're not giving enough kors

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,409
it might be pretty slow but you can make
it work if that's what you have

79
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,270
available

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,000
so taking a look at the virtualization
software so on one side you have the the

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,690
free

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,760
Oracle VirtualBox it's not my favorite I
it is tim's / preferred one

83
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,710
I it but it is totally free that's where
it really has going for it

84
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,750
I my preferred one is being where fusion
which is the mac version those being

85
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,550
more work station for windows

86
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,850
I you can get up and running with these
pretty cheaply

87
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,330
I you know if this is something you're
really serious about i do even recommend

88
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,599
looking at like being more food and pro
because it does offer some nice features

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,860
that you can't get with the normal
version is a bit more expensive but you

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,830
don't really have to upgrade every year
it's just kind of like buying you know

91
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,250
you buy windows you don't have to
upgrade every time the new one comes out

92
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,660
to eat if you're happy with what you
have and you can stick with it then when

93
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,560
you start when you first get started you
kind of want to think about what is the

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,440
first thing you want to do and you'll
set up your first virtual machine to

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,040
help you achieve that more in the blue
seam side you might want to set up

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,990
something like security onion if you're
interested in you know defense IDs

97
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,430
firewalls

98
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,020
we'll set up something like that if
you're interested in forensics the sands

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,479
City workstation is really great

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,050
you can download their BMI get started
with that malware analysis there is coo

101
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,800
coo

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,430
oh and you can start moving more towards
kind of the offensive side with like

103
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,169
samurai WTF that's focused on web and I
like web hacking kali linux of course

104
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,039
but even then you don't have to go with
one of these

105
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,300
you know there's people who don't use
cali at all they set up their own a boon

106
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,020
to and they just installed the tools
they want and you can do whatever you

107
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,560
want but you know these are really great
starting solutions and what I really

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,410
like about for example like you know

109
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,180
sans you sift and Callie is you can go
to the website and you can download

110
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,620
pre-made virtualbox and vmware images
and you just import them but they're up

111
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,860
and running ready to go with the
universalization tools already installed

112
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,419
and it's all set you open it up and
everything is configured for you and

113
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:20,609
there's a couple of specialized IBM's
and uh and lab you can go and get I one

114
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,810
of them if you're interested in ICS and
scada is called side body works and

115
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,580
actually i'll plug it quickly on my sex
talk that Kate vitae gave at myself

116
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,010
Jackson a couple of months ago

117
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,539
it's up on our youtube channel you can
find it at youtube.com slash my said

118
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,930
group and she walks through my body
works

119
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,280
you know how to get up and running is
what they use last year at the defcon

120
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,479
ICS village for their IP ICS skate setf
educate actually one

121
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,190
so she walks through you know how she
wanted what you know what happened and

122
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,729
all the tools she used and you know how
to get up and running with my body

123
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,419
so that's really cool if you're
interested in that kind of thing point

124
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,229
being that if you're interested in even
if it is something like skate ICS it's

125
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,219
possible to set up at home to get a lab
environment you can mess around with

126
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,370
even when it is something that you kind
of imagined you would need hardware or

127
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,970
special equipment for only like skata
you have resources out there

128
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:25,110
so to get started building your kind of
your base image i'll call it and I'm

129
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:31,710
gonna use cali as an example you want to
set up everything that's you know you're

130
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,659
going to want that BM to have and so you
can create backups and you have

131
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,828
everything up and running kind of begin
to your your your fresh him

132
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:48,089
perfect pristine state and one thing I
recommend is combining cali with the

133
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,920
valley beyond me download and combine it
with a script from a guy named got milk

134
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
and if you're in my talk yesterday at
also here at three o'clock

135
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:03,209
I talked about got milk it's g0t and I
one number 1 k

136
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,339
I find his get hub it's under the same
name you just look for the cow and you

137
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,630
know you got the right guy

138
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,970
he has a repository that he calls Oh s -
scripts and in there he has written

139
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,880
personalized for him bash scripts that I
go through and set up cali exactly how

140
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,230
he likes it when you install things
forum configure the apache web server

141
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,880
all the way to installing you know
Firefox extensions that he likes and

142
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,089
from you know some pressure from people
that saw that and really liked what he

143
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,320
was doing he is generalized them added
some flags and options if you don't want

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,010
you can have it set up for sweet for you
and do all kinds of cool stuff and he

145
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,410
makes available for free on github

146
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,680
you can run one of those it will go
through it takes like an hour so for to

147
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,219
run through on cali but you'll come back
alley with a completely different and

148
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,940
we'll have a bunch of new tools and and
configuration changes that we might find

149
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,420
beneficial but if you are still learning

150
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,650
you know i also recommend as i mentioned
i talked yesterday go through his bash

151
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,130
script doesn't take that long to look
through it and see what it does

152
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,730
because you might find things after you
run it i feel kind of broken or that are

153
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,760
unfamiliar to you can go back into that
bad script and figure out what happened

154
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,240
but it does create a really nice

155
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,939
Callie instance for you to get started

156
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:23,098
then you need to think about allocating
resources and we talked we touched on

157
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:24,539
this a little bit earlier

158
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,848
you have a lot of options when you start
looking through your your vm resources

159
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,739
and an additional settings

160
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:35,909
the key ones are going to be processor
cores and memory I for your base image

161
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:39,749
the thing you're you might actually be
using to attack other VMS or that you're

162
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:43,349
actually gonna be kind of living in and
using i would recommend probably going

163
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:46,319
at least for like 2 processor cores and
two gigs of memory

164
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,289
you know if that's what if you're able
to us to spare that on your your host

165
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,699
system because that will give you an OP
words it snappy enough that he doesn't

166
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,258
feel really sluggish

167
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,939
I if you start cutting back too much you
might not enjoy your time using the

168
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:00,748
system

169
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:03,539
a lot of your attacking you know the
machines here is going to be attacking

170
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,779
or that just sit up and you're going to
do nothing but be a target for you to

171
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,609
look for something to look at

172
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:12,509
you can get those like 256 megs of
memory and one processor core and

173
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:15,839
they'll sit there and be happy unless
the Creator tells you it is going to

174
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,099
need more

175
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:20,999
there's a couple of other settings -
it's worth being aware of i 1 being

176
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,169
isolation

177
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:27,119
so for your base image you might want to
have isolation turned off its off by

178
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:33,269
default but what isolation does is it
makes it so that you can't like drag and

179
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,179
drop or your clipboard won't follow

180
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,819
so if you have isolation I turned off as
it is by default like I said you'll be

181
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,358
able to do things like switch over to
Chrome on your host operating system

182
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:50,819
google something find a command copy and
you know copy it moved back to your vm

183
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:51,809
and paste it

184
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:57,389
I you'll be able to just drag a file off
of the vm and dropped on your desktop if

185
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,579
you don't want that to happen for some
reason

186
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,029
how you can turn on isolation encryption

187
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,319
it's worth considering it depending on
how you use that vm it was just going to

188
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:12,149
be a vamp vm you're screwing around on
and it's living in your computer it is

189
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,359
probably not necessary but if it's going
to be something you put on a thumb drive

190
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,859
that might have you signed the google on
it might have your accounts

191
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:24,569
I you know where you might end up having
information on it that you wouldn't want

192
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,949
someone seeing or screwing around with

193
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,510
turn on encryption so that if someone
gets a hold of that vm they can't get

194
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,520
around it and then sharing sharing is
really cool because it makes it a little

195
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,600
bit different from ice of the isolation
setting and I what you can do by default

196
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,940
you can set up sharing wear it

197
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,190
there's a file on your host system that
is shared and mounted on the vm

198
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,780
so you can drag files in there if you
are for example I use this a lot when I

199
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,699
was doing the osep so i was living in a
vm working in the lab network

200
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,780
I you know doing the exercises and
things like that I would keep notes and

201
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,890
drop them into a folder that i had
shared with my macbook that if I ever

202
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,830
want to reference one of those notes and
my BM wasn't running

203
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,920
I didn't have to spin up the BM get in
there and get it or if I want to copy

204
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,360
something back and forth

205
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,270
I would just drop it into that folder
and instantly it's available to both

206
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,790
machines

207
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,110
networking is something that's worth
paying attention to

208
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,819
and that because we're a little bit
green shifted on the screen that the

209
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,920
bottom arrow is supposed to be bright
green

210
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,180
you can't really see it here but what I
want to point out here is you need to be

211
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,430
careful about how you set up these
machines

212
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,290
so with like your say your cali box that
you might want an internet connection

213
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,959
for you might want you wanna be able to
use google you wanna be able to download

214
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,880
updates things like that

215
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,730
you can turn on you know share with my
laptop and and get you have its share of

216
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,660
the inner connection of the host
operating system that's fine but when

217
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,589
you start downloading vulnerable
machines which we'll look at in a minute

218
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,980
that's are made to be attacks that are
made to have a vulnerability

219
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,900
you don't really want to share that with
the internet or you know or whatever

220
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,280
Network you're on

221
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,370
you might not want that showing up you
know it's available

222
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,920
so make that private you know to your
laptop and you can add to networking

223
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,120
interfaces to your vm which is what
makes the m's really cool because then

224
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,300
you don't have to go up by another
network card and and put it into a slot

225
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,240
you just open up settings and say our
another network card

226
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,130
it's got one and you can make one for
your base image to be shared with your

227
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,689
host operating system in one that's host
only and then every other machine you

228
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,160
spit up on your computer

229
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,910
you just give it the one Nick make it
hosts only it will get an IP address for

230
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,069
the host only network and then you're
like your cali image you can see it and

231
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:52,000
you can play with it you can attack it
you can talk to it do whatever you want

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
and no one else could see it

233
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,410
and this is a one example of something
that gets added with a got milk script

234
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,689
to cali but you know it whether you're
using that script and cali or you're

235
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:11,079
going to set up a boon to and create
your own custom image i do recommend

236
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:14,560
that if you're doing any kind of red
team you know playing with pen testing

237
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,459
kind of stuff

238
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,550
I look into foxy proxy because this is
really fantastic

239
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,739
and as you'll see in a minute might want
to install it on your on your host as

240
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,329
well like you know in firefox web proxy
proxy does it lets you set up and as you

241
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:34,388
can see here he's got the 144 burp and
left one for ssh tunneling and what you

242
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,870
can do is that will tell firefox

243
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,899
hey I use this proxy for bird and then
when you don't want to use burp anymore

244
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,649
you just click this little box icon next
to the address bar and turn it off and

245
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,079
then if you want to go back to using
burp or you want to switch over to an

246
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,599
ssh tunnel or something use check you
know

247
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,360
click on the little box icon again
select the proxy you want you're off and

248
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,990
running

249
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,380
you have to keep going into settings and
changing the proxy settings

250
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,800
this is really really handy that's why I
want to make sure i called it out

251
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,849
because sometimes I'd I talk to people
about burp and this is really irritating

252
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,790
i forget to turn the proxy off and then
I think my internet connection is down

253
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,500
and etc etc its value you can solve
proxy proxy makes it really easy

254
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:21,099
now once you have everything setup you
got foxy proxy install the run got milk

255
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,860
script you installed some stuff you

256
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,860
you're ready to go you're happy with
what you have take a snapshot

257
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,550
because if you don't take a snapshot and
then later you screw something up

258
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,420
you're gonna have to go through the
whole thing over again or figure out how

259
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,889
to reverse that change you make a
snapshot you can just at any point go

260
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,240
back click the restore button and your
back up and running to how it was when

261
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,500
you took that snapshot

262
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,720
it's awesome this is a really really
powerful tool

263
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,160
a so so use it and use it even you can
make as many snapshots as you want as

264
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,920
long as you have a hard drive space for
it you can keep making snapshots you're

265
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,680
about to make a change to something you

266
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,670
you know you've been working on some
projects and all right before i make

267
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,569
this final change i'm unsure about
snapshot make that change see what

268
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,379
happens

269
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,699
so this is a really great way if you're
curious especially you know blue - blue

270
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:13,850
team example you have a pass or
something or some change

271
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,089
you want to make your environment at
work or in your home and your not sure

272
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,500
how to interact with things you can set
up a BM make that change and see what

273
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,449
breaks if it breaks

274
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,679
roll it back make a different change
rinse and repeat until you're happy with

275
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,679
what you know what you learned another
option you have you have to make that

276
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,260
snapshot is you can create a clone of a
vm and what a clone will do is you know

277
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,720
i mean it just close it by copying it

278
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,500
I but we can be kind of neat is you
create linked clones so you can set up

279
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,049
an image that then if you need to for
whatever reason you want for windows 7

280
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:56,090
machine set up in your in your home lab
and you want them to all be the same but

281
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,500
now you have to go make the change and
each and every single one of them

282
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,210
you don't have to do that you can create
linked clones where one clone are three

283
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,260
go three clones will all be linked back
to one like master clone you make a

284
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,710
change that master clone it propagates
out and you're good to go

285
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:19,970
so then once you are happy you know you
have your snapshot

286
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,630
you created some clones maybe you're
good to go and you're ready to actually

287
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,840
start adding stuff to your lab actually
start doing something

288
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,120
it's actually is easy sometimes this is
double clicking you download a file you

289
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,840
double-click it and vmware it's already
been associated with vmware it launches

290
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,639
its important you're good to go

291
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,780
sometimes you just right click open with
vmware open with virtualbox and you're

292
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,559
good

293
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,250
not always though at you guys with some
of the sites will talk about where you

294
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,390
can get the m's you might end up with
one of a couple of different files

295
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,309
I you don't have to memorize this but it
does help to be somewhat familiar with

296
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,678
what these files are so vdi is the
virtualbox virtual disk image and I put

297
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,570
that first because this is Oracle's
proprietary format so vmware will not

298
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:12,029
open that only oracle on the Oracle
VirtualBox can and some people will put

299
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:17,519
out a CTF images or something like that
in vdi format p.m. decays

300
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,320
isn't it the open which virtual machine
disk this is an open format so anyone

301
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,490
can use it

302
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:29,249
virtualbox and vmware both understand it
and then if you're using vmware you have

303
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:32,190
a couple of files that you might just
start seeing like what it was this file

304
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,389
this directory

305
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:38,129
luvm accident being were configuration
files you have snapshot files and start

306
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:43,559
making snapshots obf files you'll see
sometimes and that's another open format

307
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,970
the open open virtualization format and
then just I through this and the bottom

308
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,189
it's unlikely if you're following along
with me that you'll use it but Microsoft

309
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,679
doesn't have their own my PhD

310
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,169
microsoft virtual hard disk that you
might see sometimes if you do end up

311
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:08,249
with the vdi image and you are would
rather be using vmware like I do not all

312
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:08,909
is lost

313
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,889
I have virtual box installed just
because this is included with it and

314
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:18,809
utility called vbox manage and what we
must manage lets you do is easily clone

315
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:24,029
a drive a virtual disk but it also has
an option then lets you change the

316
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,980
format of that disk and like I said
virtualbox understands vmdk so you can

317
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,330
say please take this me DI image clone
it and I want the target to be called

318
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,428
you know whatever . vmdk and then -
format vmdk take a few seconds it will

319
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:42,269
spit out of the NDK file they become and
we can then open up in a vmware

320
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,810
once you have all that setup and i have
a new lab machine is important to vmware

321
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,409
you have to actually find it and if
you're new to this sort of thing that

322
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,550
can be somewhat intimidating because you
aren't sure where to start looking

323
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,720
not one of my favorite ones to use as
net discover

324
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,250
I which isn't a tool like you're talking
about too often you say you load up your

325
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:13,720
cali BM or going to or whatever it is
and you fire up your other BMG is added

326
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,680
they're both you both you look at your
host only network and you see that it's

327
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,470
192 168 . 110

328
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,860
so you can spiral net discoveries they
did not discover

329
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:30,310
- are arranged 192 168 1 10 . 0 / 24
couple seconds later was like here's

330
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,820
everything we see in that range and
it'll it'll probably will be you and

331
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,389
it'll be one other thing was likely and
there's your you know there's other

332
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,500
Vietnamese found it because many of the
bm's you might be firing apartment for

333
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,420
you not to touch

334
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,840
they want me to show you a login screen
and they're like a CTF kind of thing

335
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,510
where you're not supposed to know
anything about it

336
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,510
so this is a great way to learn
information about it that you wouldn't

337
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,310
otherwise have

338
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,909
and if you're interested in the
offensive side of things

339
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,990
there's a website called bold hub that I
love love love

340
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,280
I and just recently bring up got milk
again

341
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,560
he's one of the one of the people that
maintain that site along with Rastamouse

342
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,030
and no mode a couple of other people and
just recently actually was funny enough

343
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,060
it was like the day before the circle
city kind of workshop where I first gave

344
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,409
this talk

345
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,240
they relate he did a talk with a couple
of other people where they released what

346
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,210
he called stapler which is a vm that
they say a beginner difficulty but as

347
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,540
you can see he marked it as like ? ?
little winky face

348
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,470
I can supposedly and here's a little
challenge for you even if you are a more

349
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,680
experienced with the offensive side of
things

350
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,700
there's a very easy way to get root and
get the flag on this etf box to help you

351
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,480
learn

352
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,929
but according to got milk there's a much
more difficult

353
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,360
hidden way that he won't tell anyone
about to get rid on this box so that as

354
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,030
i know a couple people that are that
have still been working on it trying to

355
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,860
find the hidden way I and you have to do
to get a shell on this on this pm

356
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,460
but what's cool about this the reason I
want to call it out is because he gave

357
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,840
this as a presentation

358
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,299
he did his own kind of build a lab
workshop that was very offensive focused

359
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:20,918
I like I said like a week before we did
we did ours and the day before our to

360
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,360
release this and there's a link to a PDF
version of their presentation where he

361
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,149
walks through what is volt hub

362
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,970
how to get started coming some of the
things that we've already talked about

363
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,450
today and then also goes into exactly
step-by-step how-to on this machine

364
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:46,540
so if you're totally new to things that
can help yes pornhub

365
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:55,270
yep yep like vulnerable like vulnerable
hub episode it's so there's a couple of

366
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,809
others

367
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:01,030
yes vote on hub calm and there's a
couple of others that i would recommend

368
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,080
checking out especially if you're if
you're a beginner and what's really

369
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,129
great about this is there something
there for for everything that you might

370
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,960
be interested in this ones that are just
funny that are just like fun CTF they

371
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,590
use riddles or there's puggles not even
really they don't rely on you really

372
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,770
having technical knowledge if you can
connect to a port you can find the

373
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,000
machine it will give you a puzzle you
answer a question it gives you a flag

374
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,360
and you move you know you move on deeper
into the dough into the machine

375
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,040
some of them like brain pan will are
really awesome for exploit development

376
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,040
if you're interested in that you liked
the first one I think start off with a

377
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,190
simple buffer overflow and you can work
your way up from there

378
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:47,169
there's there's a series called pono s
that I up the whole array basically kind

379
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:51,280
of a more standard vulnerable image here
hey we have a vulnerable version of the

380
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,010
operating system you figure out how to
attack it as well as como les cayes

381
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,610
optics has a bunch of different
interesting challenges d Isis grades

382
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,508
some of the dev random ones are

383
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:08,239
honey there's one called sleepy that's
like seven words seemed a little bit so

384
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,099
you can have a lot of fun with these

385
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:16,999
now let's say you are in a situation
where you don't really have the hardware

386
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:23,389
to run a bunch of pm's or you just you
don't know you don't you're really kind

387
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,939
of intimidated by vmware what have you

388
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,239
there's other things you can do or maybe
you're just not interested you know

389
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:32,719
because there is a lot of I realize a
lot of the more interesting stuff that I

390
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:37,249
got no I get excited about our offensive
focus but there's other things you can

391
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,929
do at home

392
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,409
that's lab you know that's in a lab
doesn't require a bunch of hardware that

393
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:43,549
you can play with

394
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:49,399
I we're just using Hardware you already
have I begin with there's a wasp makes a

395
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:53,988
project called bricks and bricks is
really cool because they do make a vm

396
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:58,339
for this and i'll call it out if you
look for the OWASP broken web app

397
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:03,889
project be web and they make a vm that
has bricks and a whole bunch of other

398
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:09,529
stuff that they've put out over the
years in a vm with ton dozens and dozens

399
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:13,729
of web apps i will teach you here's this
is the command injection section here is

400
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:16,879
a bunch of web apps your career that
have command injection go find it

401
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:21,228
this is sequel injection this is this
this is that so if you're interested in

402
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:23,179
web app or app sec

403
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,329
awesome that's an awesome tool but
bricks let's say you don't you don't

404
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:30,049
want to set up a BM or you're just in a
situation you're at work you want to you

405
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:33,769
know you want to do this for training at
work we don't you know you can set up a

406
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:40,039
BM bricks you can download and it just
is just a directory on your computer

407
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,219
it starts up its own you start below its
own little web server

408
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:46,459
it uses your host OS it's not going to
do anything to you

409
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:50,509
I you know you can sit there and own all
these web applications and it's not

410
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:55,309
going to hurt your host OS and all you
have to do is you can just use burp in a

411
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:56,359
web browser

412
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,260
all you know all free stuff download the
free version of burp on your computer

413
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,330
and fire up your own web browser on that
host operating system with bricks

414
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,270
running and you can attack the web
applications

415
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,520
no you know virtualization required I
even take a further step away from using

416
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,960
anything you know I'm your computer then
burp is over the wire over the wire is

417
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,300
really cool because all of their
challenges are ssh and web-based so you

418
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,570
go there arm yourself with a terminal
with ssh and I either you know whatever

419
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,710
your favorite proximo you want to use a
loss a poor burp suite you go to over

420
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,430
the wire and they have all these
challenges me to work on from like the

421
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,300
base level one is called bandit and
you'll ssh into a server they gave you

422
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,480
the username and password and there's a
challenge there you will have to use

423
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,810
grab to find the password you'll have to
use find if you use different linux

424
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,110
commands so if you're new to linux is a
great way to learn that will challenge

425
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,100
you in interesting ways to find stuff on
their on their server and you'll

426
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,879
graduate to the next one and the next
one they have a i gave a list they give

427
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,660
you do as a suggested a way to work
through all their challenges and

428
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:08,450
eventually you'll get to one that is a
all web based where you use burp and

429
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,420
some of those get really really tricky
but it's also really great walkthrough

430
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,890
is available online and I got asked at
Circle City khan and measure the

431
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,520
walkthroughs is do I think walkers are
cheating actually write some of the

432
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,260
walkers to look for a bow hub

433
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,879
I think it's a lot of fun and I write
them because I want people to read them

434
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,050
not really to check their answers so to
speak but because that's how I learned a

435
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,669
lot to get started on the offensive side
of things was because if I got stuck

436
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,700
some on something if there's a tool i
don't know about or an exploit I don't

437
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,700
know about or some service that I don't
realize is vulnerable

438
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,890
I'm not going to suddenly understand
that information by staring at it for

439
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,580
weeks and depriving myself of
information already available to me

440
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,610
because there is a thing on your web
browser when you look at those

441
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,909
walkthrough is called the scroll bar and
you don't you can go down just far

442
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,350
enough to get a hint to move forward and
then step away you don't have to read

443
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,580
the whole thing and I would keep those
open a browser would have and work on it

444
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,080
work on and if a couple hours have gone
by like I've been made

445
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,350
progress I'd go and look at it and
usually be something like I haven't had

446
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,539
no idea that was something available to
me and then your your spew sprint for a

447
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,390
couple hours and then you're back to
maybe where you hit a wall

448
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,130
so definitely use those and there's a
bunch of them available for over the

449
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,330
wire and and bricks as well as google it
with like what you're stuck on you'll

450
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,559
find a bunch of blog posts and things
like that but then even stepping further

451
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,908
back from there

452
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:36,840
there's pfsense and like openwork if
you're interested in networking &

453
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,668
firewalls and you do have some old
hardware or you know a router that you

454
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:45,299
wouldn't necessarily mind breaking if
you make a mistake you can even play

455
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:51,210
around with some young openwork you know
I tomato play around with and enhancing

456
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,340
your router play around with pfsense set
pfsense up in a virtual machine and

457
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,199
route stuff through it

458
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,080
you know putting a play with the
firewall there's stuff you can do at

459
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,590
home

460
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,389
I you know it personally when I I i was
in a situation where i just bought a

461
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:10,139
house several years ago and I was still
doing a lot of networking at the time

462
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:15,299
and I was interested in wiring in my
house and that became kind of a lab in

463
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,149
itself a figure out how do I want how do
i run

464
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,809
cat5e through this house how do i wire
it up

465
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:26,429
how do i do everything and then how do I
organized this network afterwards it

466
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:31,679
became its own kind of awesome projects
and you know that was just a physical

467
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,380
thing that I could do at home that if
you don't if you're interested in that

468
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,039
sort of thing and you don't get to run
cable or it's not something heinous they

469
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,450
want to do with a job

470
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,929
you can do it once and even if it's just
running cat5 look around your apartment

471
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,100
I you know setting up your own like
wired network and you can be pretty

472
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:54,029
beneficial thing depending on where you
are in your career and that's we

473
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:57,630
actually finished really quickly so I'm
gonna open this up to questions

474
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,640
yes

475
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:21,479
mmm yeah so a lot of people do still set
up like physical networks up and play I

476
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,570
mean and you can look at you can do a
lot of cool things that right like just

477
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,330
look at the CTF across the hall

478
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:32,550
so what you can do is is really a lot of
the same stuff we talked about here you

479
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,260
could set up a network and with that
sort of situation you can even set up

480
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,070
things like being able to pivot and
often the offensive side of things you

481
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:47,490
can you know what you attack one machine
and then that machine is scale back of

482
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,760
it you can set up like kind of nested
networks right so where you could almost

483
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,200
set up like a dmz that you can attack
with then you know through your switches

484
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,940
in a traditional switches and routers
have been machines behind that DMZ is

485
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,680
over you have to attack the the first of
the machines in that TMZ and then pivot

486
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,420
through them to attack the other
machines setting up different you know

487
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,750
like all except one of the web server
one of something else

488
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,140
see I mean really all the same
opportunity is there for you with maybe

489
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,700
a couple of of additional opportunities
because its physical but i would say get

490
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,020
started with whatever you're interested
in you can use those machines to spin up

491
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,230
that web server whatever it is it that
catches your eye

492
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,230
thanks for the question

493
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:51,810
I'm sure yeah i mean it it

494
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,710
unfortunately I was my cancer it's
really depend on what you're interested

495
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,810
in but yeah like you go ahead

496
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:03,389
you know you can simulate a tax simulate
different types of web traffic and yet

497
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,060
sniff that traffic and then go through
the peak apps afterwards and see what

498
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,090
you can see it's really there there's
endless opportunity of hair so it would

499
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,990
depend on exactly like what you're
interested in at the time and then send

500
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:21,870
us your lab you could make changes to it
at any moment and scrap it and start

501
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,370
over with something new

502
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,370
yes

503
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:51,120
well yeah

504
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,400
so odd that's a fair question and worth
pointing out and it's actually something

505
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,210
I even said that boom hub is aware of
because if someone is creating a new

506
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,120
vulnerable vm and it's pretty easy to
i'll create a bond of a web app and

507
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,229
that's the way in

508
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,520
I'm all set up a wordpress site that's
really old and and that's the way in

509
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,300
I and they're aware of that and there
they are EXO that community is making a

510
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,300
pretty concerted effort right now to try
to get out more

511
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,520
different types you know exploit
development and more like basic stuff

512
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:27,870
ah so that people can learn more greater
variety of things but yeah it's far but

513
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,379
obviously none of them a lot of those
are CTF based on so they don't really

514
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,960
mimic an enterprise network

515
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,699
so you can definitely absolutely set up
you know exchange or you know mail

516
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,029
servers what have you if you want to
make this a no specific network

517
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,250
I the one difficulty that you might run
into there is just getting it's not

518
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,940
entirely it's super easy to get windows
and all that set up unless you have

519
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,918
access to be like a nemesis msdn
subscription or something like that but

520
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,009
it's it's something i played around with
it and you can use a virtual lab for

521
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,940
that as well as long as you can run you
know multiple machines on your laptop

522
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,660
your desktop you can absolutely spin up
you know here's an exchange server

523
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,500
here's a couple of windows boxes and
that's where like a lot of times like

524
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,130
linked clones and making clones machines
can help because okay i want to set up

525
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:19,590
several windows boxes and going to set
up yet windows server

526
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,460
you know what whatever i have on six
machines and then i'll make one exchange

527
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,000
server one this one that and and play
with right play around with them there

528
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:42,780
yeah sure i'm as far as if you're
looking for anything physical

529
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,490
I'm often told and this is something
that I really take advantage of because

530
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,129
i live in a college town and so do you

531
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:55,380
I is is university reclamation will get
rid of switches and old desktops and

532
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,840
servers a lot that you can pick up for
basically pennies compared to like what

533
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,590
you're getting you know even as far as
things like actually full blown like

534
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,940
Cisco switches

535
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,930
you know I i I've seen people for sale i
call really want to get into networking

536
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,040
or what I'm trying to get my CCNA I
really want some way I can play with a

537
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,300
cisco switch but there

538
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,680
I don't have thousands of dollars to buy
this which I want to put

539
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,890
sometimes the universities are literally
throwing them away you pay them fifty

540
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,549
bucks and you get a really expensive
piece of hardware that you can play

541
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,420
around with

542
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,450
ah but that's at yeah I remember when I
especially if you're a student

543
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,520
I remember being classes with professors
coming in saying I have literally like a

544
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,700
barn full of old servers but i'm trying
to get rid of

545
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,700
also you will keep a lookout for
situations like that and know that maybe

546
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,759
you'll have to fix it up a little bit
depending on

547
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,420
maybe something's broken or it's you
know doesn't have any video out or

548
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,770
something about that a video card or
something something like that but I i

549
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,400
would say I'm definitely looking for
like a university reclamation and where

550
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,370
you were just school districts the
school district near you

551
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,370
you know that might be getting rid of
all desktops

552
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,850
they probably be the best the probably
some beers you know more more outdated

553
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:15,350
but they'll be really cheap and you're
setting up the mic up like a you have

554
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:19,220
the room for a physical network they
have to get the job done my building on

555
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,220
a couple of virtual machines for you

556
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,430
never

557
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,430
options yeah

558
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:50,649
do you happen to have I see SMG and have
it with you it's probably cause probably

559
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:59,590
ran q is not that's not a problem I've
had but don't say you have you had it

560
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,590
with you can take a look at it and it's
not a problem i run into myself

561
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:16,810
yes I'm bill

562
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:22,000
i typically i mean if you set him up to
grab a dhcp address and they have you

563
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,510
don't see your host only network go grab
it from from the pool of items available

564
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:33,670
vmware will assign them one now
shouldn't I mean you can you can even go

565
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,170
in just as a thrown out that you can
actually even go in and change the mac

566
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,150
address for virtual machine which can be
kind of fun you can make it look like

567
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:49,240
it's an essay on by the NSA or something
like that and and make up a lot of

568
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,720
changes like that - to the bmv people
start digging into some of the the

569
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,919
hardware changes you can make but no as
in general you can spin up as many as

570
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,470
you want and it will keep handing out

571
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,060
vmware will keep handing out vmware mac
addresses and IP addresses no problem

572
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,140
any other questions or comments

573
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:18,330
yes I

574
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,990
these are just easier solutions to get a
hold of and there's a lot of

575
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,399
walkthroughs out there

576
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,790
personally I prefer vmware like I said
Tim preferred virtualbox but I maybe

577
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,240
there's yet there's lots of options like
that available there's no real you know

578
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,529
I wouldn't tell you not to use it is
just what what I got started with what i

579
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,950
really like and like virtualbox
especially the minutes

580
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,830
it's a free download so it's something
that can a lot building just get up and

581
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,470
up and running with really easily lead
to get started

582
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,430
anything else

583
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,950
alright thanks everyone
