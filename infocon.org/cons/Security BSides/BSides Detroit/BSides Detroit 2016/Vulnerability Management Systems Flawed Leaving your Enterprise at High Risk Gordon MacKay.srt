1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,900
ok there but oh great great

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,820
so my name is Gordon and i'm gonna be
talking about vulnerability management

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,600
and a flaw that i guess i've been
working on this for many many years and

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,900
that I guess you can say the limitation
but first who has worked with

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,890
vulnerability management systems anyone
or knows about them

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,000
that's okay because what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go through the slide

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,930
deck and I'm not going to tell you what
the flaws right away but what I like to

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,700
do is play a little game and if you can
guess this limitation

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,980
just raise your hand and all prompt you
and if you get it right you don't get a

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,419
prize but you get recognition

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,210
so that's pretty good right so I'm
Gordon I actually work for digital

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,430
defense on their CTO

13
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,150
it's located in san antonio texas

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,460
so it's my first time to Detroit I
actually i was born in Montreal Canada

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,009
so just up the road and you know

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,850
great white north i guess so I'm
familiar with snow and I thought hey

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,408
it's a little too cold

18
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,070
I got to get the get down south they
still got that the a accident

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,798
anyway I started off my career in
montreal canada started working for bail

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,560
northern research has a software
developer in telecom and spent maybe

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
five years there and then I thought if
I'm in telecom

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
where's all the action and I realized
that that's in dallas texas

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,299
so that's what i did i moved my family
to dallas texas actually got a

24
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,970
competitive offer so i started working
for a competitor

25
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,970
nevertheless it was in telecom and I
spent many years in telecom writing

26
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,179
telecom switching call processing

27
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,669
you know those kinds of things many
different languages etc

28
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,659
and then around so loved Alice many
years there around the year 2000 to

29
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,700
actually prior to that telecom started
going downhill and so I looked around I

30
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,060
was actually being laid off so it's
proactive I knew and I knew was coming

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,060
our whole project was being laid off and
i found a digital defense and I went

32
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,290
down for an interview

33
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,190
they wanted to bring me on board to work
on that they had a vulnerability

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,640
management system so that's part of what
we do we do vulnerability management we

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,319
have our own system

36
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:36,040
there's quite a few patents that we have
for this system and so I I came on board

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,250
and worked with for people to redesign
the system that was sort of very archaic

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,370
porny architected two-tier so for
example if we needed to choose database

39
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,519
structure we have to change code in many
different locations

40
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,000
so I came on board and we redesigned it
and as I was doing this

41
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:02,380
I realized a certain challenge and
that's what this talks about

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,549
so let's move forward so what I'm going
to do is going to give you an overview

43
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,090
i'm going to talk i'm going to open up
the discussion with an information use

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,600
case to set the stage give you an idea
of what we can use the vulnerability

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,350
management for i'll talk a little bit
about vulnerability management

46
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,380
technology background to set the stage

47
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,760
i did a study related to this but a year
and a half ago and I call it the

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,530
prevalence of network churn

49
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,489
I'm going to actually cover a little bit
about that and then I'm going to reveal

50
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,420
the flaw

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,420
maybe by that time you already know what
it is please raise your hand as we go

52
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,640
i'm going to talk about this consequence
consequences of the flaw and then wrap

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,958
up with a conclusion

54
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,370
so here is a use case

55
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,950
so let's assume that a new zero-day just
came out

56
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,790
this is not real a hypothetical don't go
to this talking Gordon just you know

57
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,429
revealed a zero-day or an Apache that's
not what's happening

58
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,840
so assume that a recently announced a
zero-day came on a patchy but for an and

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,120
impacts to point 4.0 up to the

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,150
the the release prior to the most recent
one right

61
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,480
so the two point four point two three is
not impacted your safe but prior

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,250
releases are vulnerable

63
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,779
what would you do if you are a
vulnerability management person and I

64
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,039
see some of you are

65
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,240
what would you do to find your risk you
would likely run a vulnerability

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,970
you probably have been running
vulnerability management scans for quite

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,320
some time but you'd likely want to find
out and baseline where am I at with this

68
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,400
problem right so you could run a recent
vulnerability management assessment

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,460
across your network to find the issue

70
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,229
that's good but and and most people will
stop there

71
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,909
but there's another thing that you
should do and that is you you realize

72
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,810
that your endpoints may not have this
issue today but in the past they may

73
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,229
have had it for example maybe you

74
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,669
d install the patch at some point right
so it was there at one point and a

75
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,870
vulnerable version was present in the
past but you won't see that today if you

76
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,639
just want a recent skin

77
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,660
why is it that important it's important
because these are candidates where an

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,130
attacker may have already compromised
your end . maybe you didn't see it maybe

79
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,780
didn't have you know very in-depth
incident response and so this

80
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,080
information would give you some
intelligence in terms of where could i

81
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,430
look to see potentially i might be that
this is extra intelligence in other

82
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,750
words that make sense

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:43,849
so on this hypothetical use case I I
this is a diagram that showing where I

84
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,229
was vulnerable in the past and where my
vulnerable now

85
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,210
so this is basically just a small
network diagram basically to the red

86
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,280
dots show where the vulnerability
existed in the past so this is where

87
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,760
Apache for those vulnerable versions

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,789
what's present in the past and the the
vulnerable now is showing us instances

89
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,590
and there's only three dots there are
three red dots instances where on today

90
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,669
vulnerable so again if I just looked at
that vulnerable now which many many

91
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:17,549
folks would do

92
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,060
so they're missing a lot of intelligence
if that makes sense

93
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:29,310
this is just the diagram to drive home
the case that that end . that you see

94
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,000
right there where the blue lines kind of
like drawing across their reading the

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
same endpoint

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,990
ok I like these little diagrams

97
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,020
I kind of you know want to sort of
fantasize that I mean you know back to

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,229
the future with doc he's on the board
and he's drawing and all these

99
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,160
futuristic diagrams but anyway so the
these are these this is a different type

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,320
of timing diagram and i'm sharing it now
just because i'm going to be using this

101
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,930
kind of diagram as we move forward in
this presentation so the bottom part of

102
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,700
the diagram represents the real world
assets the true assets as an example

103
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,320
that laptop that's on the desk is real i
can go touch it

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:18,030
I know where it is because I can see it
and 11 of the I guess jobs of a good

105
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,219
vulnerability management system isn't
just to scan one point in time but the

106
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,780
scan that end . multiple times across
time to read

107
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,260
basically you want to understand all
that i patch this problem yes or no

108
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,520
in order to do that you rescan right so
vulnerability management or and scanning

109
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,390
isn't like what used to be in the olden
days where he'd pay someone and you do a

110
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,500
scan one year and then you let it go for
when you come back the next year and do

111
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,070
another scan you you're probably going
to scan more frequent right so one of

112
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,200
the problems or challenges i guess that
vulnerability management systems have is

113
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,700
to relate those two different endpoints
as their scanned across two different

114
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,150
points in time to the real world asset
this diagram showing that that's

115
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,590
actually working fine

116
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,349
um this is this is just a point in time
Richards and stuff up there

117
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,280
I mean for this kind of stuff and I'll
prompt you to you

118
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,219
you know what i'm talking about as far
as this lock you do raise your hand if

119
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,000
not that's okay moving on

120
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,890
so let's talk a little bit about
vulnerability management technology

121
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,090
scanning technology

122
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:34,169
so there's different technologies to
scan right there is credential base

123
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,809
there's a remote unauthenticated and
then there's agent-based i'm going to

124
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,229
start off with agent base there aren't
that many solutions out there

125
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,970
they're coming back i guess but many
solutions in the past you use what's

126
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,690
called agent-based and then people
worried about em I got this

127
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,110
you know piece of software on my end .
is it a rootkit or not

128
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,070
so they were sort of worried about that
but essentially what agent-based is is

129
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,040
it's a program that's running on your
end . that scanning that same endpoint

130
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,780
right so there's a presence on the end .
that's why they call it an agent agent

131
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,569
basically any very accurate because it's
right on the am . vs remote on

132
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,450
authenticated which is scanning
technology where the engine scanning

133
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,400
engine is remote

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,819
so I'm just pointing out that projector
and pretending that it's a scanner we

135
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,360
have some scanners that actually kind of
look like that and what it will do is it

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,590
will send messages to the various
computers at its scanning and based upon

137
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,310
the different tests that it's doing in
the responses from the end . it will

138
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,839
draw conclusions in terms of what
vulnerabilities exist on those endpoints

139
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,470
that's remote unauthenticated credential
base scanning is sort of a mix between

140
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,840
the two and that is where the engine the
scanning engine is actually located on a

141
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,010
remote device and it authenticates to
the end points in some form or fashion

142
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,849
and once it's authenticated to that end
. you could ask questions at all you

143
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,370
know it could pull the registry keys

144
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,630
it could look at the files etc so it's
very close to agent base as far as how

145
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:18,380
much it can detect but it still remote
so it's kind of a mixture between the

146
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,180
two pros and cons of these different
solutions essentially and I know it's

147
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,099
the end of b-sides and you probably want
to get going so i'll i'll skip over this

148
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,370
quickly but agent based technology is
going to have a little bit of an

149
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,360
overhead as far as administrative right
so if you have to go put an agent on

150
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,649
every single end . if it's windows-based
maybe it's not that difficult because

151
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,529
maybe they're already joined to the
domain but if it's linux-based might be

152
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,910
a little more challenging

153
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,550
so key messages it's a challenge to do
it takes a little bit more work than

154
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,510
fast compared to say if you didn't have
to use agent base and you refusing an

155
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,510
unauthenticated scanner for example
right

156
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,490
prudential base is a little easier but
you're still going to have to set up for

157
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,180
potential 'he's and you're going to have
to set those credentials up and join you

158
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,120
know your computer to the domain and
those kind of things and if it's a

159
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,120
linux-based systems and you may have to
install agents like SH or enable ssh in

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,589
order for the the scanner to actually
authenticate to that node so

161
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,380
prudential based very accurate finding
just as agent basis but still a little

162
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,670
more challenging to deploy as compared
to the next one that we're talking about

163
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:41,300
which is remote unauthenticated remote
authenticated typically organizations

164
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,819
will use and in all vendors most vendors
will offer a solution that covers

165
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,029
definitely remote an authenticated

166
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:54,589
most of them prudential some of them now
have agents and so there's a mixture of

167
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,630
the different three and organizations

168
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,339
what they'll do as they're scanning is
they'll get the system going quickly the

169
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,820
vulnerability management system will
scan across the boarding and cast a wide

170
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,980
net

171
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,660
and perform remote an authenticated
scanning that you know to enumerate

172
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,280
their devices find open ports there are
etc and i'll do that on a recurring

173
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,850
basis and they'll use credential based
or agent based in cases where they know

174
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,530
where they're

175
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,620
you know where their critical assets are
and they want to put a little more

176
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,650
resources they want to get more
information more information more

177
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,590
insight and through the problems and
vulnerabilities there so that's where

178
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,620
they would use that

179
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,010
so basically just talk about this
takeaways most vulnerability management

180
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,580
vendors actually offer multiple
different ways of scanning

181
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,580
unauthenticated scanning is definitely
part of that solution

182
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,990
prudential base scanning from what i can
tell most vendors have that as well and

183
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,440
some vendors have agent-based there are
a few other techniques such as passive

184
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,920
scanning and if you want we can talk
about that but we're going to leave that

185
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,479
off to the side right now

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,900
again most organizations employee remote
unauthenticated scanning to cast a wide

187
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,420
net catch you know the issues and then
typically will use credential be

188
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,280
scanning for high risk assets

189
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,660
no hands yet as far as insight on the
flaw

190
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:24,460
remember that diagram that i showed you
before at the very beginning where I was

191
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,420
talking about the challenge of under
like it fine if I'm using if I'm let's

192
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,680
say I'm an organization and i'm running
vulnerability scans and I'm doing them

193
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,729
every week

194
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,990
the the system the vulnerability
management system has to relate that

195
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:50,950
endpoint to multiple points in x week 1
week 2 week 3 week or so so the question

196
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:56,200
is how does it know that that laptop is
the same laptop from one scan to the

197
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,930
next and it's important to know because
if you discover vulnerabilities on it

198
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,420
and in the next week

199
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,420
you miss and you miss map it

200
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,599
you're going to conclude

201
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,839
that those vulnerabilities have been
fixed

202
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,990
if that makes sense but that's assuming
that those two endpoints have nothing in

203
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,560
common as far as vulnerability just make
that has stated simple

204
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,160
so how do these technologies actually
solve that problem

205
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:33,269
and so what I did is I I i did some
research because we had this challenge

206
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:35,370
as well and I want to understand

207
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,550
well well first of all we came up with a
solution

208
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,109
so we already invested money in the end
a solution and then we wondered did we

209
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,430
just waste time because it looks like
the competitors aren't really worried

210
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,769
about this too much and I looked out
into the world and one of the largest

211
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,839
vendors actually tells you how they do
it

212
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,910
you can go on their website you know
Google find it and they'll tell you this

213
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,490
is how we do it and so I put this up on
the screen so they use and i called it

214
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,290
i called this right okay so
organizations use one or more network

215
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,980
detectable characteristics to match keep
what i was talking about what will get

216
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,319
on an exhale yes you've got a point

217
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:21,689
yeah I'm sorry actually was talking with
the next slide

218
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:27,000
so we'll get to it but what is that
meander already shouldn't say backpack

219
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,850
it's call us

220
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,149
yeah that and and and we'll get to it

221
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:43,290
but anyway what they use is you know IP
address for example if you have a server

222
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,250
that typically won't change its IP
address that often right

223
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,329
if you have a laptop that's sort of
moving around a lot it may especially if

224
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:56,579
it's in a dhcp environment so IP address
is a very good trackable

225
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,319
I guess characteristic that you can use
to relate to different endpoints across

226
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,969
time but it's not the only
characteristic especially when you're

227
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,920
looking at device types like laptops
desktops the type of things right but

228
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,050
there are other characteristics that
technologies can use

229
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,640
so this is what i was getting on the
kind of miss the slide here

230
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:25,329
so right Wallace this is how they do it
and it's it's not bad

231
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,430
because what happens is it's simple they
tell you you have one of three different

232
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,439
characteristics

233
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,050
ok - to be able to solve this problem
and they call this host tracking

234
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,019
that's what they call this problem host
tracking so if you want to google host

235
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:46,300
tracking quality blindness and as an
administrator of the vulnerability

236
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,329
management system once you purchase
their solution

237
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,149
you would then go into the portal and
you would indicate what tracking

238
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,740
mechanism so you

239
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,220
I call this algorithm single host
tracking heat

240
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:06,429
admin user specifies one of IP address
in this hostname or net by association

241
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,300
so you have three different
characteristics to choose from if you

242
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,780
don't do anything than the default is IP
address

243
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,520
so if you purchase that solution and you
just want to start scanning you can do

244
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,250
that but what happens is after weeks and
weeks of scanning you're going to start

245
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,429
seeing mismatches and you might not even
know what's happening

246
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,600
and the reason is because you're
matching on IP address

247
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,129
by default and maybe you have laptops
that are in dhcp and you know they

248
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,300
switch their IP one day you go home come
you come back you get a different IP you

249
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,470
don't really care

250
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,120
this system that scanning it mismatches
it because it's using IP address so this

251
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,760
is analogous to like if you look at your
fingerprint you can select like if you

252
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,290
want to do fingerprint matching you can
select this is quality you can select

253
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,350
one of three different areas on your
finger

254
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,809
you have to tell me which one and then
i'll use that to track it is that makes

255
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,210
its question

256
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:23,860
right so you can only select one but
basically you

257
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,459
you could you could you give it so you
basically say I want to use this

258
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,779
technique between this range in this
range so IP address a to be

259
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:37,659
I want to use IP address tracking be to
see I want to use DNS hosting tracking

260
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,230
etc

261
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,320
that makes it so typically if you're
going out you know if you're worried

262
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,299
about tracking laptops you're probably
going to use netbios name

263
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:53,049
if otherwise use IPS or sorry I IP
address matching or DNS hosting if that

264
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:53,830
makes sense

265
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:00,070
and so I did this study this is what i
was referring to i did this study i

266
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,360
wanted to understand

267
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,340
well how often do these endpoints change
these characteristics

268
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,689
the reason that it's important is
because for agent-based scanning

269
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,750
technology you have a program that's on
the computer so you can give it a unique

270
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,830
identifier and you don't have this
problem so if you're using agent-based

271
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,250
only as part of your scanning solution

272
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:30,789
this is not a problem prudential based
when you authenticate to an end . you

273
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,789
can actually drop an ID on that end . a
unique identifier and then the next time

274
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,890
you come back and scan another week

275
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,059
you come back and use and you look to
see well do I have to die already scan

276
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,649
this in the past if I did I should have
an identifier there so you don't really

277
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:53,350
have this issue with credential base
scanning and agent basically whereas

278
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:01,570
with an authenticated based scanning the
scanning engine can only solve this

279
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,129
problem and match end points across time
based upon what it sees from these

280
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,540
characteristics

281
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,500
ok so the question is how often do these
characteristics change

282
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:26,330
yes ok god yes

283
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:34,070
you got it yes so what basically he was
saying what was your name Brandon ok

284
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,590
what Brandon you just said and that's
good

285
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,919
he be solved the puzzle ok and we're
going over we're almost there

286
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,660
and the the issue that he just described
is because these characteristics change

287
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,950
more often reading than what we believe
they changed and because unauthenticated

288
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,200
scanner uses these characteristics to
actually match these hosts across time

289
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,360
you're going to be incorrect

290
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,330
they're not always going to be incorrect
but they're going to be incorrect to a

291
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:13,580
certain level and that level is far more
than what we originally believed in fact

292
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,770
when I look at this

293
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,100
what what I worried was that we were
just wasting our money because it

294
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,350
actually takes time to write in to write
software that actually does this kind of

295
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,750
almost an analogous to a fingerprint
matching pattern matching when i was in

296
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,260
school i did one of my final projects
was pattern matching algorithms and so I

297
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,460
did some research on it

298
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,610
so when I got the digital defense and i
look at this on the cool this is cool

299
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,480
this is an area where i can use my
mathematics skills and i can put this

300
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,780
intelligence into software and so I did

301
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,490
the problem is its complex it takes time
and with complex software you're going

302
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,390
to get bucks

303
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,110
so there's ongoing maintenance and
there's like me you know the comic con

304
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,070
comes back and says and and we knew
about this problem so as we're working

305
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,290
with clients we hone this algorithm and
this time went on and it got better and

306
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,580
better and better but nevertheless it
does take money and if competitors are

307
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,470
not worried about it as much

308
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,650
and no clients are complaining about it

309
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,790
then there's economy that you have to
kind of look at your solution so as a

310
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,300
software developer in the beginning time
you don't really care about economics

311
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,800
you just want to write some cool stuff
but then as time goes on in your life

312
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,700
you start you start understanding that
there's economics that plays into it

313
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,500
so this is the reason that I wanted to
do this study and so I did and I found

314
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,850
so what I did is I actually subdivided i
did a study that looked at data to

315
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,290
understand how often just do these
endpoints changed their characteristics

316
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,490
across time and I looked at different
types of endpoints server endpoints

317
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,580
client machines like laptops firewalls
on a second

318
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,500
you know different device types etc
printers etc and so I'm listening only

319
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,200
to different types of devices up here
but i found that even if you're a server

320
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,880
type and . those devices change their IP
address even you wouldn't think they

321
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,440
would but they do four percent of the
time across so this analysis basically i

322
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,970
did as i looked at assets for internal
networks not external I did look at

323
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,420
external as well but that's not what
this is showing and I looked across

324
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,260
three months and I declared if the end .
changes a characteristic at least once

325
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:38,290
across that through three months time .
that's a hit and so IP address i found

326
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,210
that IP addresses first servers change
approximately four percent and then

327
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,230
there's other characteristics that i
listed their dns host name changes a

328
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,710
whopping 46-percent night it was
confused about that and then ran it

329
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,700
again and then I went and I talked to
some clients in their IT teams to

330
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,820
understand what was going on and I got
some good answers to that validates this

331
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,260
so essentially these characteristics are
changing far more rapid it might have

332
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,610
been that in the olden days they didn't
but nowadays with everything that's

333
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,159
moving there's clouds mobile etc

334
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,460
there's a lot more network movement and
so the this sort of easy solution of how

335
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,900
one tracks end points across time might
have been okay for

336
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:35,380
you know years ago but nowadays it's not
effective enough takeaways right so this

337
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,940
is basically just showing the same end
point where its IP address has changed

338
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,970
and . changes over time significance
alright so bringing it together

339
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,889
most widely used scanning technology is
remote unauthenticated scanning because

340
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,440
it's easy to deploy and it saves money
right and you don't really need

341
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,770
I mean if you can do agent-based
everywhere and you wouldn't be in it

342
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,580
costs just about the same amount of
money then people would do it but it's

343
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,250
going to cost more to do more

344
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,060
so typically organizations are going to
cast a wide net with an authenticated

345
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:19,000
skin most vulnerability management
vendors and I looked at several track

346
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,570
and I look at the big guys . in time
scanned endpoints using limited set of

347
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,620
remote discovery and . characteristics
IP address this hostname netbios name

348
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,229
some use mac address

349
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,830
interesting i gotta talk good i got a
question that one of them is like

350
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,850
delivered this of different b-sides and
my organization thought hey why don't

351
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,709
you go out get out of Texas get out of
like the west or Midwest and go to

352
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:50,050
different parts and you know go to the
b-sides and so this is my first time in

353
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,169
Detroit and it's cool because i'm
learning a lot

354
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,100
I'm seeing different talks here and
hopefully you guys haven't seen this one

355
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,100
before but anyway I digress

356
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,960
most remotely discoverable
characteristics are subject to change

357
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:11,080
I didn't know how much but the stats
show that at least for me more than more

358
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,659
than i would have thought the vm flaw is
that vulnerability management systems

359
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,080
and really I should say limitation but i
just want to be more attractive in a

360
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,220
title to put father and hopefully
attract more people often track . in

361
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,600
time scan in points to incorrect assets
they get it wrong because of this

362
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,649
problem

363
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,950
so what does that mean if they get it
wrong to different types of problems one

364
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:44,510
is acid duplication and asset mismatch
and we're gonna look at these right so

365
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,250
here's an example

366
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,340
so when my week one and i'm showing 3
endpoints only in my first week i have

367
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,409
three endpoints and I have the IP
address is listed in the dns hostname

368
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,520
and my source in a min max there's other
characters and put on this TV score

369
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,120
what happened is sometime between week 1
and week to the red end . actually

370
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:16,610
changed its IP address and so did the
other one the black endpoint was turned

371
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,610
off or it wasn't caught in the scan
right

372
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,470
so in week two let's assume I i'm using
this

373
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,180
qualis solution and I didn't do anything
with it and so on tracking my IP address

374
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,800
by default

375
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,070
great what's going to happen is it's
going to it's going to declare that that

376
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,939
red endpoint is the same as that yellow
it . but it's not

377
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,270
and when that happens you could imagine
any all of our ability assuming that

378
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,450
there's no vulnerabilities in common
between the yellow and the red asset

379
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,320
it will declare all of the
vulnerabilities that it found on the red

380
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,500
outfit as having been fixed and it will
of course the clear newborn abilities

381
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,360
but hey i'm doing some you know I want
to show my executive team a little bit

382
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,330
of stats i can see probably more
buildings i fixed

383
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,899
yeah I got some new ones but don't worry
I'll take care of so mismatches good

384
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,710
right

385
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,920
no it's not good so moving on

386
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,240
now we are in week 23 so we discovered
this problem let's say we discovered it

387
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,660
like

388
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,390
darn it we had a mismatch this is if
you're looking closely what you would do

389
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,780
is you would say well for my red end .
and maybe a certain range

390
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,060
I'm actually not going to use IP address
anymore i'm going to use DNS host name

391
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,080
because that's something that I can
track on and vendor allows you to do

392
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,590
that

393
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:44,560
great so so what happens is in skip
somewhere between week 23 and 24

394
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:57,340
the dns end . actually changes its name
is that correct yes i believe so anyway

395
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,350
I should be looking on here

396
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,800
right so what happens is the red asset

397
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,820
oh ok no the red assets actually so you
change that you change the end point the

398
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,179
dns matching perfect everything looks at
everything works great

399
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,190
the scan at week 24 actually matches up
and it could've been you may be found in

400
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,240
week six

401
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,980
so for many weeks you were matching up
correctly using the dns hosting the red

402
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,600
asset matches correctly

403
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,510
everybody's happy but one of the
problems is in weeks weeks can 24

404
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:37,210
because the yellow and . now has the 192
168 40 . 5 IP address and it is also

405
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:43,150
using IP address matching the system is
going to declare it as a new asset many

406
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,240
many vulnerability management systems
that's what they do they'll declare

407
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,390
look I don't see a match it must be a
new asset

408
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,450
let's add it to the asset list so now i
have four computers for endpoints as

409
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,940
opposed to the reality which is three
and i'll admit even when we actually

410
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,940
came up with our algorithm we had a very
large client and their asset list was

411
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,520
sort of jumping that going up across
time and they're like hey what's going

412
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,120
on

413
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,080
and were like oh did you guys at new
assets and really know what we added

414
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,919
some but this is crazy it's going up
it's going up and we found that we were

415
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,010
actually duplicating assets

416
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,580
even though we had our you know pretty
intelligent algorithm so we have to hone

417
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,840
etc so this is just a little star wars
reference

418
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,350
even though I'm a Star Trek fan

419
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:45,640
does that make sense so far ok so there
are impacts to this and i'm not going to

420
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,430
go over this list but i will say like a
little you know there are several when

421
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:57,340
there are several prospects that we talk
to and in fact I even this talk

422
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,439
the first time I gave it was in dallas
and there was someone in the audience

423
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,980
who came up to me afterwards and he said
that's my problem

424
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:13,419
and I didn't realize it and so it's kind
of a problem that once once you people

425
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,100
just assume that it works

426
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,429
I guess is the best way to say it they
can purchase the vulnerability

427
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,720
management solution

428
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,030
and why would it not match I mean it's
just week to week or you know every day

429
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,770
or whatever it should just match

430
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,889
they just assume that it does and then
they'll see some issues but when you

431
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,070
have a hundred thousand no 10 points

432
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,340
you're not going to see the little
needles in the haystack

433
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,139
sometimes you will but you'll be
confused and I mean I went on to some

434
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:52,540
competitive websites such as rapid seven
call it obviously and others and some of

435
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:00,100
these some of these companies have I
guess if you have a problem you could

436
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,360
actually go onto the website the forum
and say hey what's going on I don't

437
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,580
understand and its public so it's not
like oh I'm a client I have access

438
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,230
yeah if you want to open a bug of course
but if you just want to unite talk about

439
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,100
a problem

440
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,699
you can go on to the community website
whatever its called I think security

441
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,810
streets for rapid seven and you pop in a
problem an issue

442
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,940
and if you go searching through there
you're going to see that

443
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,140
that people don't understand what's
going on there they're experiencing acid

444
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,630
duplication and an asset mismatch

445
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,680
but they're there they're communicating
their problems in a different way

446
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,690
because they don't really know that
that's the problem

447
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,470
if that makes sense right and sometimes
this

448
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,850
the question is I want to start over I
wanted to lead all my data from my asset

449
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,320
list how do I do that

450
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,790
that was the question and the answer is
why do you want to do that and then they

451
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:57,659
explain what's going on and I just want
to start over and the conclusion is

452
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:04,440
ah you know this is the issue obviously
the ideal scan this can end .

453
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,440
correlation that's what i call it used
to call this thing

454
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,420
reconciliation because I was like how do
we would he call this problem and you

455
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,930
know from the quick and days etc like
okay reconciling accounts so

456
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,910
reconciliation but people didn't really
understand that and so now i'm calling

457
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,440
it scans the skin . correlation it's a
little longer but people kind of get

458
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,050
that a little more because it's like a
scanner to scan oh ok so the idea is to

459
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,399
obviously match

460
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,650
you know however you're doing it match
up the right asset to the right endpoint

461
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,390
that scan across time

462
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,230
so what can you do number one be aware

463
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:50,190
be aware of this problem when when I
talk to people who are evaluating

464
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,060
vulnerability management systems by and
large what they're doing is they're

465
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,510
running one scan and they're looking to
see

466
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,370
did you find these issues and so though
don't look at three vendors and the run

467
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,689
one scan this

468
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,730
it's really scan for vendor a scan for
vendor be scanned for vendor see and

469
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,230
then whoever gets the most accurate
results and there's other you know can

470
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,889
you know kind of other criteria that go
into but that's all they're doing there

471
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,179
what I'm trying to share is they're not
actually looking at what happens if i

472
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,969
run scans across time do you guys
actually have a problem with that

473
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:32,909
or are you miss matching my assets are
you really sharing with me what my true

474
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,290
risk is or at least given me a good idea
of my

475
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,230
risk if that's what women really
management systems are supposed to do

476
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,100
right and the risk isn't just one point
in time scan the risk is communicated to

477
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,460
you and in this plate back to the use
case that i shared at the beginning

478
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,940
it's not just one point in time scan you
have to look at the past

479
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,159
you have to be able to go into your
vulnerability management system and

480
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,259
query it and say wow I have scans across
time I want to understand what happened

481
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,000
three weeks ago

482
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,290
and to do that it has to map correctly
and if it doesn't you have a problem

483
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,210
this is the wrap-up I just alluded to it
again historical security information is

484
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,740
key to risk intelligence again it's not
just one point in time scan

485
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,160
you gotta clear your system look back in
the past how well are you doing are we

486
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,980
proving are we at a sort of steady state
and then the use case that i shared in

487
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,050
the beginning you only be able to solve
that if you had good magic across time

488
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:37,630
endpoints change their characteristics
do to normal ID administration is not

489
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,040
like rocket science it's just the IT
people are moving printers around or

490
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,970
changing things things are breaking so
they're changing the IP don't we changed

491
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,189
to change the printer people aren't
going to be happy but they're going to

492
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,340
do it anyway and then that's all the
problems later

493
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,330
so when selecting a vulnerability
management system of them evaluate scan

494
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,700
scan correlation capability that is all
I have questions

495
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,560
second yes

496
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,100
Nessus qualis the terrible one

497
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:36,380
security center they do so i guess they
have an algorithm that they don't really

498
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,810
publish publish so you kind of have to
discover what it is and with security

499
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,259
center it's my understanding that they
actually take in data feeds from for

500
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,660
example dhcp so that actually helps and
they're all gay rhythms hands off its

501
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,940
like on the one hand koalas

502
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,080
you could say oh I don't like it because
i have to actually get involved

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,490
like I have to go actually indicate how
how do i want to match but on the other

504
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:06,439
hand it's flexible because if you miss
if it mismatches you could change it and

505
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,340
it corrects the past by and large
there's some issues with it but it

506
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,210
actually goes back

507
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:28,910
yeah okay yeah i found Security Center
wasn't it it

508
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,600
look like a perfect algorithm but it
wasn't from what i can tell better

509
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,600
quality is that what you're using

510
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,259
oh ok excellent good

511
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,130
maybe we should talk more so it's tough
any other questions

512
00:37:49,970 --> 00:38:00,080
static IP addresses so right so that's
what I'm sharing is when we say okay

513
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,410
this computer has a static IP address

514
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,129
like in large organizations you
typically what's happening is you have

515
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,200
your IT teens and you may have more than
one team and then you have typically a

516
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,950
centralized security team that's quick
kind of responsible for scanning the

517
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,640
entire organization and then we'll go to
them and say hey we need to remediate

518
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,330
this and there's issues with that but i
guess the answer your question

519
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,470
nothing's really static I mean it's
static for a certain amount of time

520
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,910
until until they decide well i'm going
to change the IP address for whatever

521
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,359
reason don't it will still be static
will be a different one

522
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,399
so for a certain set of weeks it's it's
this IP address and then someone comes

523
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,950
in and says i'm going to change this
printer or whatever i'm going to do

524
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,710
something with it so now it has a
different IP address

525
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,820
ok let's go communicate that to the
world etc but it's not like a situation

526
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:56,000
where static is static forever and
that's what my study found as I I I

527
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,600
assumed it would be more static than
what i found i guess is the best way to

528
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,960
say it but it's not

529
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:15,199
yes that's what I'm thinking - exactly

530
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:27,380
yeah right

531
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:36,739
yes

532
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:40,489
excellent point yes yeah anyone else

533
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:46,160
alright think it's

534
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,879
much appreciate it
