1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,490
thank you guys for me all right all
right car hacking basics hexadecimal oh

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,950
it's so five anybody know what that
means it means it means 101 it's a

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,509
one-on-one guys one it's my awesome
binary to hex conversion

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,500
I thought I thought everybody would give
awesome

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,189
ok so let me just tell you a little bit
myself because what's the point of doing

6
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,109
these things if you're not gonna like
you know

7
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,009
prop yourself up a lot as much as
possible so I'm i started a company

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,829
called canvas hack back in 2010

9
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,620
basically I was laid off and didn't have
anybody can do so and i like to have

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,919
cars so i started a canvas hack

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,250
we started in ferndale super deal that
we will go up to aura

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,670
Orion is my email address on aim
accurately Elliot and attack that cops

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,960
you can hold me always

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,710
also can go to my web page even during
this talk to feel like it

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,980
like take your phone out if you're done
playing pokemon go

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,210
you can check it out i think there's
actually a paki stop right by my office

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,030
so if you guys are Lord it's right there
it's so convenient so very helpful

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,750
so I'm just gonna I mean this is that
gave me a 30 minute slot probably going

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,189
to take all of 15 of it will have time
for questions and answers like that so

20
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,520
i'll try to move I move pretty quickly
through it a lot of this Alice kind

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,140
enough to talk about so i'm going to be
unfortunate reiterating some things but

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,479
in a in a fashion unique to myself and
so we're going to talk a little bit

23
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,470
about you exactly

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,050
funny

25
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,370
there's a difference so we're going to
talk a little bit about networks

26
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,070
let's talk as you start with basics we
start with that works because that's

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,360
really my focus when i'm working with
vehicles as i like to tell I like to

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,150
work directly with the networks
themselves you can work with controller

29
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,630
that's fun interesting but a lot of the
fun happens with the communication

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,570
between the controllers and there's a
there are a whole bunch of different

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,769
standards different networks and putting
on what year your vehicle is and i'll

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,260
talk to you a little bit about how you
can figure it out yourself

33
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,700
this is really for you guys later when
you get back and get back to your car or

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,179
your parents car your sister's car and
you know hack that car is that you don't

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,120
want to hurt your car your motorcycle
even some of the motorcycles actually

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,380
have canvas I'm not too

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,370
so talk a little about that so if you
want to

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,970
you going to pop hopefully with the
information you got today and you'll go

39
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,609
to my website you'll be able to at least
get started in hacking your your own car

40
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,630
or your neighbors car he wants to know
if they give you permission

41
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,500
that would be nice pretty good idea it's
ok line

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,959
it's really kind of where it all started
kayla is the fundamental network and

43
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:50,860
it's really old

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,190
very few OEM still use it so it's still
in use

45
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,690
very inexpensive so that's the reason
why its costs always born and then we

46
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,950
had <operand> two </operand> 15 which
let's talk about BPW pwm which were

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:09,040
different different variations on the
same standard and old again

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,679
not very many cars use it Ford and GM
will primarily the main consumers of the

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,120
pwm pwm now we have canvas which is old

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,050
technically but it's not busted still
being used and we'll talk a little bit

51
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,600
in detail actually a lot of detail how
canvas works and some of the show you

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,530
some examples of canvas messaging and
we'll talk a little bit more about how

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,670
you guys can use canvas messaging

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,589
and maybe do some simple controls are
you even like read data from your

55
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,709
vehicle itself so something very simple
flexray is relatively new it's the

56
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,959
network designed to help solve some of
the problems of canvas some security

57
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,750
issues canvas flexray does salt but
mostly it adds redundancy and speed to

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,880
networking in vehicles and is currently
used on a handful of vehicles

59
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:12,119
No most notably for me anyways is the
infiniti q50 uses flexray for their

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,649
steering by wire so the only car
currently that allows you to actually

61
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:24,599
that is actually can be physically
mechanically disconnected and the the

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,160
steering wheel is not actually
controlling this steering the steering

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,050
wheels that's a motor that does it sort
of the joystick and quick if you will so

64
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,250
and it uses flat tray because of its
safety features and security features

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,280
that they've added to it so it's really
nice

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,400
most which is media oriented system some
transport it is still being used

67
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,710
I thought it was going to die and maybe
it will die soon but gee I'm just added

68
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,909
it to their there's some of their truck
so I i I'm not really sure if it's going

69
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,450
away or could stay but it's another sort
of heist higher speed serial data

70
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:09,690
network that allows for up to a hundred
and fifty megabytes that's right

71
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,070
megabytes of data which is a lot for an
automotive and you know just inside of

72
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,789
your car you want to transfer video we
will do it and that's that's what

73
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,050
they're using it for is just for video
between controllers and things like that

74
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,280
so that one

75
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,630
the display can be remote essentially to
control himself and then the internet

76
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,190
which thank you they're finally adding
ethernet two cars we've been talking

77
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,850
about it for a long time and now it's
now it's really happening BMW be one of

78
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,139
the first ones to add

79
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,469
you know a standard ethernet and then
later we'll talk about the variations

80
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:46,560
they're adding well so I let's talk a
little bit of ECU's or engine control

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,900
units or sr MGR electronic control units
so there's a lot of them in your car you

82
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,349
might have a body controller window you
know driver a driver door controller or

83
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,719
a passenger door controller shift
interlock controller your cluster your

84
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:09,810
head unit you have maybe a rear
controller your body controller your

85
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,599
onstar your telematics device so you can
have any number of different controllers

86
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,460
even to the point where i've seen in
some ford vehicles they have little tiny

87
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,969
little LED lights that pwm lights that
change very very called the colors in

88
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,150
intensity so it may be blue or red

89
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,800
it has little controller on it and is
connected through a network so all of

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,180
the lights even the lights to the point
or even controllable and which if you're

91
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,139
going to have fun

92
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,349
you know if you want to control the
lights and the pattern in which they go

93
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,419
you can do that headlights although the
light lighting can be a lot of fun

94
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,849
well it could be a lot loads of issues
ten at ten is probably the minimum and

95
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,599
you can get up to 40 if you count those
little tiny ones maybe you've got 60

96
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,229
your car

97
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:03,719
you know so adding on what would you
call a little magic valley electronic

98
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,860
controller so there's a lot of different
controllers on there and really the goal

99
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,319
of the each controller is to essentially
physically connect switches to motors

100
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,899
right or physically connect inputs the
outputs so if you want to roll your

101
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,469
window down you hit that switch that
switch goes to a little controller and

102
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:24,719
the controller and store it connects to
a motor

103
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:28,169
but if you want to roll the passenger
window down from your driver side make

104
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,310
that switch goes to the controller sends
it over a network goes to another

105
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,610
controller that controller then sends it
over to this controller and then the

106
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,060
window goes down and hopefully it's fast
enough that's a no latency

107
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,479
so the user when they hit that switch
window goes down could very quickly

108
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,360
afterward so we as you can see there's a
lot of different features there

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,550
the other part of a controller may be
more advanced cancer

110
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,390
or is your engine controller what does
it do it fires the individual cylinders

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,680
inside of the engine

112
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,310
well so there's a lot of difference
features that these controllers have

113
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,600
they might be controlling motors
windshield wipers or and taking input

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,500
from switches and it doesn't it isn't
necessarily the same controller that has

115
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,070
the input from the switch that does the
actual output and that's where a lot of

116
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:17,340
the fun comes in when they set the
systems are are are integrated over a

117
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,020
network

118
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,919
whenever those that switch is remote
from the motor that actually controlling

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,430
it

120
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,790
usually there's some sort of command
that happens over the network and where

121
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,230
there's a command over the network

122
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,250
we can insert are all essentially so
that's a lot of the lots of work where

123
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,030
the fun comes in when you're hacking
your cars or your friends cars and

124
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,289
sisters car

125
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:43,890
your ex is going to happen so you get
the idea that it so it all starts here

126
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,189
a lot of the time so a lot of the OEMs
have all of their networks conveniently

127
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,220
broke it out at the obd2 connector

128
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,920
not all of them fought many of them do
and I'm sure after all of these things

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,810
that are happening this will be very
soon going away so but today a lot o am

130
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,260
still have this that's a good fifty
percent of them still break out all of

131
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,930
their networks to this connector which
is the obd2 connector or j1962 connector

132
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,150
the 16 pin connector

133
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:20,579
not all pins are populated and this is
actually very important point because

134
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,520
when you look at that this this
connector

135
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,160
I usually when i get into the vehicle
the first thing i do is take a picture

136
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,329
of it just to see what pins are popular
because this will actually tell us what

137
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,090
networks are on it and my next fight
will go over that

138
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:40,320
so what networks are potentially
available to you so you have been CEO

139
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,620
this one's got a high-speed camera this
one's got a single where canvas was got

140
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,050
a fault-tolerant can you can actually
tell of face off of this connector a lot

141
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,520
of that information

142
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,939
so that that can be very useful for you
well it's really there for diagnostics

143
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,160
right that's that's that's its legal
reason that's really when all cars 96

144
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,329
and newer have this connector and the
that are sold in the united states and

145
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,890
even in Europe have a very similar
connector as well I've seen in china now

146
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:17,310
so a lot of the lot of the other
countries also have a very similar

147
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,890
connector at a lot of them are purple
and black like we have your us but said

148
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,990
it's usually located rate within usually
within a meter of the center of the

149
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,430
driver cereal

150
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,339
so it's in other words it's reachable
from so if you're a terrorist attack

151
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,090
that's trying to solve a problem on a
vehicle you can plug your tool it plug

152
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,620
to land somewhere within the steering
wheel so it's really underneath

153
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,730
it's called the drivers kick right where
your degree were kind of where the well

154
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,900
where your feet goes it when you're
driving so that's where you find it

155
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,530
just go up underneath their get a light
you'll find it sometimes hidden between

156
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,880
an access port

157
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,180
it might be a panel you have to pull
down but usually it's labeled obd2 will

158
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,439
say on it

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,250
the court has that a lot they're really
easy to find there's also websites out

160
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:05,760
there

161
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,350
you're really really our stock you can't
find it there's websites for obd2

162
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,530
locators and things like that will help
you find a location

163
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,650
so what's on it

164
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,180
the connector itself I know it's have a
little fuzzy

165
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:29,880
the connector itself is has has multiple
pick Bob pins here so this is pin one up

166
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,130
here all would have been 16 down here so
if you hit saw something in pin to or if

167
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,170
you saw something in pins a six and 14
you can actually quickly tell what kind

168
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,209
of what kind of network you're connected
to like this example on this is pin - is

169
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,620
it populates that's <operand> two
</operand> and fifty

170
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,279
right so this together vehicle has
<operand> two </operand> fifty there's

171
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,730
two versions of changing 50 pwm pwm if
it had two pins that we would know it

172
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:07,990
was a PPR pwm and then this one is
essentially it's GM's version because g

173
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,760
mjtt was just one wire that's a one wire
connector

174
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,939
it has ground here two pins of ground
chassis ground in a signal ground and

175
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,600
then us 12 volts or vbat if you will and
so you can actually run

176
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,010
you know that's got power all the time
so if you want to put your cell phone

177
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,880
charger on here and make an adapter you
certainly couldn't run all the time

178
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,630
so if you're looking for power and then
it's got two other pins and these two

179
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,439
other pins are actually discretionary so
there are some that are not

180
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,830
discretionary like two four five six

181
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,920
all of those are fixed they must be this
and then the other pins are what's

182
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,670
called discretionary pins so the OEMs
themselves can put whatever they want

183
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,540
their and they do whatever they want
sometimes they put ignition

184
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,069
like if the ignition is on it will be 12
volts on a pick it up in sometimes I put

185
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,730
the vehicle speed on there so we'll just
be like a pulse

186
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,529
also as the wheels spin they may run by
a little sensor and every time it

187
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,420
rotates you get a pulse until you see
engine speed up their similar idea

188
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,349
that'll just be a pulse out output up to
other networks

189
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:31,330
GM uses in 14 single wire kan Ford uses
pens 3 and 11 for a secondary can bus

190
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,080
so you can get canned other can buses
other things like that so there's a lot

191
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,160
of difference

192
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,689
a lot of different information that you
can quickly discern from this connect

193
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,100
question sorry

194
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,520
so with this connector if you see it and
you're on a GM and pin one is there's

195
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,459
something in one single where can but if
you take that over to fiat 500 and a

196
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,030
good example if you have been one is not
single can because it's a different om

197
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,240
so each om has sort

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,380
a different look for this connector and
the their motivation behind is really

199
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,910
really quite simple

200
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,550
this is their court this is their
interface for their scan tool to plug

201
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,719
into their cars right and so it's going
to be all that discretionary pins are

202
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,480
going to change because the OEM has a
scan tool that is expecting certain

203
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,040
information are certain things to be on
these particular pins and so it's for

204
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,880
them and so the way they'll move is
between a belt they'll they'll try to

205
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,430
keep it across the same across all of
the vehicles that they manufacture which

206
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,449
in turn

207
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,740
if you think about what that means that
means all of their scan tools have an

208
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,649
interface port and so if they wanted to
change this

209
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,180
the cost would be immense right if they
wanted to move with something over for a

210
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,180
different pin while they have to change
all of their schedules and that would be

211
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,680
a billion dollars you know just to make
one change on the sport so they tried

212
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,670
their very very cautious and it's very
difficult for them to make changes in

213
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,510
court so i can tell us a lot of
information about the vehicle itself a

214
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,980
little more technical

215
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,260
there's limbo us as well so if you're if
anybody here is familiar with canbus

216
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,939
will talk about later

217
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,209
there's also another network that I like
to use it's very hackable is a lot of

218
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,680
fun and a lot of the new vehicles
they're starting systems use the bus and

219
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,459
a lot of their lighting controls and
things like that usually live bus it's

220
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,699
not broken out that obd2 connector but
it might be broken out to other

221
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,720
connectors in the vehicle so you can
find this network as well

222
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,250
and what's nice about Lynn is it's very
low cost so you can find an arduino I

223
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,800
any standard any any kind of standard
one wire to one wire you art so if you

224
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,359
have a uart on an arduino to make a
circuit to turn that those two wires

225
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,640
into one and there's plenty of examples
if you have something that has Kaline on

226
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,630
it as well

227
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:01,089
it's also very easy to your Facebook
well it's just a 12 volts standard you

228
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,829
are that runs typically between ten
kilobits - 19 kills per second so you

229
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,930
can hook it up to your computer and
least monitor the data sending the data

230
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,779
is a little bit more of a challenge you
have to write some your own

231
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:18,220
code or you can buy tools that do it for
you and i'll talk about two little later

232
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,680
but Lynn bus is a really quite a
interesting network as well because it's

233
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,498
relatively new but it's using old tak so
its low cost and easy to enter into and

234
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:33,069
you can get a lot of different control
done with the limbo so not very many

235
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:37,449
people talk about it just because it
seems so basic but if you're trying to

236
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,949
hack your car and try to have fun with
it if you want it you know maybe the

237
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:45,699
tournament's individual lights on or
gets you know switches lot of this

238
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:52,599
little switches like your door car door
window switches and things like that if

239
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,139
you want to do

240
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:56,889
controls are typically going to Overland
bus I have another cup I have some

241
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,970
customers that use the bus for turn the
windshield wipers on you want to turn

242
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,150
the windshield wipers on the bus is a
really good way to just activate those

243
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,780
those features effectively so the bus is
kind of unique

244
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,819
there's two stars every there's one
frame the frame similar to canvas head

245
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:21,789
holds up to eight bytes of data and it
allows you to send a message to a

246
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:26,980
controller as a master and then the
slaves notes the other nodes on the boss

247
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,289
will respond inside of that same frame
with their data so it's a little bit of

248
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,980
a challenge when you're working with it
because if you want to send data online

249
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,429
but you have to sort of cut the master
out of all communications and then sort

250
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,809
of simulate the Masters method so it's a
that's the only challenge with my bosses

251
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:49,149
that does involve usually removing wires
from either a connector or cutting the

252
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:53,260
wire specifically so be very careful
when working with the bus in that regard

253
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,120
but the BSO the master does need to be
removed when you're doing

254
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,799
ethernet which is something I honestly I
don't have enough experience with the

255
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,059
b2b really talk about it but I can talk
about what I can look up online and tell

256
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,799
you guys a little bit about it

257
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,179
ethernet is now coming to vehicles it's
very very new

258
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,260
we know that the Tesla has it but a lot
of the ethernet that we see in vehicles

259
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,279
today is your standard Ethernet that you

260
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,879
plug into your computer for the changing
that change that in vehicles right now

261
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:30,080
they're making their own internet
because four wires cost twice as much as

262
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,039
two wives

263
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,369
so why reduction is is huge and vehicles
because they have a lot of water - and

264
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,340
much as they can reduce they can reduce
two pennies

265
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,789
they'll do it because that saves
hundreds of thousands of dollars right /

266
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,349
call for a good model year so we like
that so the pennies cost a lot into

267
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:49,968
wires possible whole lot

268
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:57,049
so they're reducing it and they're so
that made this one pair internet open

269
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:02,658
group and you can go to open sig . or
can actually get this back for it as

270
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:03,049
well

271
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,989
um I didn't talk about that with my boss
but if you order the spectral in bus

272
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:08,839
that's also free of living in bus sub
bless them

273
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,700
Lynn sub us that org as well so it's
some of these facts are free which is

274
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,359
nice

275
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,629
it is based off of standard Ethernet
made it to the 11

276
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:22,488
I go to that 11 . 3 so you

277
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:26,419
you know if you get an adapter you know
for standard Ethernet to open Ethernet

278
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,999
you can actually send and receive data
on the Internet

279
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:38,629
what the data will be it not going to
necessarily be tcp IP packets and it

280
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:41,748
might just be proprietary data that they
ship

281
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:45,469
you know it might be their own
proprietary protocol which is very

282
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:49,879
common of OM just send their own make
their own product primary protocol so a

283
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:53,330
lot of research still needs to be done
about the security of these protocols

284
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:00,289
and if they're effective they I think
they use standard Ethernet so for

285
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,509
America just so that layer still intact

286
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:05,479
it's just that high level protocol
whatever they're going to use they can

287
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,139
use whatever they want honestly
sometimes i use tips tcp/ip and pack i

288
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:15,349
have seen can bust at traffic over
tcp/ip so will the packet repack canvas

289
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,689
using their own private call

290
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:25,700
so and that's that's my very limited
entree into this because it's very new

291
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,149
like all cars that are coming out with
it are

292
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:33,289
they're just coming out of there really
expensive to buy rating outside but

293
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:38,119
they're coming up now I'm two wires and
they're going to so this actually said

294
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,889
this supports up to a hundred megabytes
per second right now the max and then

295
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:48,859
they're working on a gigabit as well so
we'll have a 22 yr gigabit coming out

296
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:50,539
and then probably a few years

297
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:54,499
well I'm so we'll see it in cars and
probably a good 10 years so they're

298
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,659
going to have you know being pipes are
going to connect the telemetry units

299
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,889
with the head units so that they can do
over there updates right i mean that's

300
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,939
that's one of the big reasons three
flashing flashing reflashing because of

301
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,619
all of these because of the problem of
canvas just takes you know if you get in

302
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:17,718
your cars let's say you wanted to get a
new reflect you're looking dark bag you

303
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:21,379
get into your car you turn it on it says
hey I got a new update for you

304
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:26,359
would you like to apply it and you hit
yes then you have to wait 30 minutes for

305
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,509
it to apply people are not gonna be too
happy they're gonna hit us next time

306
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:30,259
right

307
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:34,429
so we really have to have a fast pipe
that's going to allow us and that date

308
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,969
as quickly as possible between the
controllers

309
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,499
you know the other option you know the
the Williams have two options right they

310
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:48,830
can have all of the firmware stored in
one module that has enough a storage

311
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,968
capacity so they can reflash other
controllers or they have two little you

312
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:56,059
catch it on the actual controller itself
which requires twice the amount of

313
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:59,389
storage that can be quick so they have
these challenges that they have to do it

314
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:03,799
if you make it faster than we can update
it and so that's a reason why they're

315
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,899
doing that right now is is mainly
updating and large large amount of data

316
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,710
now of course you can send video there's
some ancillary features you can add to

317
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,399
that because in some video but not very
many people use video and their me I

318
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,070
mean everybody's a video on their phones
or tablets

319
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,729
it's not such a big concern and not
getting no he's not going to do it it

320
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:25,999
really need that video in the backseat
all wired

321
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,359
you know that'd be great you can still
use wireless video so the reason why

322
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,859
they're doing it's just mostly for on
updating from where is the number one

323
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:36,080
driver

324
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,019
I guess and why would they need update
firmware it's like any packing this

325
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:39,470
stuff

326
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,510
so that's probably maybe so let's talk a
little about canvas little bit technical

327
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,890
starts a little dry but canvas his
controller area network as we talked

328
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,090
about earlier

329
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,860
there's different blood rates but you
can see it's typically goes up to 500

330
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,949
kilobits per second so it's not
superfast right

331
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,130
we don't have super duper high speed
with canvas

332
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,630
what we have is high reliability and
short packets really quick messages that

333
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,559
deliver the information and then shut up
right here is your data

334
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,059
real quick what's your engine speed
that's it really small packetized pieces

335
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,460
of data that don't need to be big

336
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,710
they don't need these large uh there's
not long msgs not very verbose right

337
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,940
a lot of and because of that you have to
shorthand a lot of the information right

338
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,809
everything needs to be sure handed
you're given eight lights to tell

339
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,980
everything you need to say about the
status of this particular switch for

340
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,980
this motor for this and really we have
eight bytes at 64 bits if you can put in

341
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,669
one bit

342
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,059
put it in one bit that switch if you
push the down button on that switch and

343
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,629
you could fit in one bit if you open the
driver door and you can fit in one bit

344
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,169
put in one bit because we have no we
have four doors plus the hatch plus the

345
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:56,720
hood you know let's let's put them all
into one bit instead each and so because

346
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,350
of that we find that everything is
really small messages really quick

347
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:07,250
simple and in very very very efficient
at the end of the day but with

348
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,770
efficiency we lose that security

349
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:17,960
we were talking about earlier so if we
wanted to insert our own verte value so

350
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,220
if you send it

351
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,429
if a canvas message was sent on the wire
and you wanted to send your own version

352
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,020
that exact same message

353
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,590
it can be done and that's the challenge
with canvas so there there are ways of

354
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,360
mitigating that we've seen you know you
can sign the message but you only have a

355
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,229
bites

356
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,940
so your signature is going to be really
small right very small bites of 8 bits

357
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,510
of signature is that it's chat it's a
challenge to really secure that but you

358
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,070
could but that's that's sort of what
some OEM to have to do now is they they

359
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,450
put small signatures on them just still
so that's it you're challenging but

360
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,350
replay attack

361
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,590
we're playing them still very much a
possibility but if you want to change it

362
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,389
to challenge

363
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,960
so when we have

364
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,000
it's a multi master network that means
any note at any time can send a message

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,659
as long as the bus is free right so
that's the challenge right so if you

366
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,990
want to do you want to secure the the
the medium

367
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,740
it's not possible you have if it meant a
message needs to be sent any notes

368
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,730
allowed to set at any time this is just
the fundamental feature of canvas

369
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,390
there are three different flavors so
when a lot of people when they talk

370
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,480
about canvas they're often talking about
ISIL 11 10 9 8

371
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,970
- - which is due lire can but there is a
single where can I and fault-tolerant

372
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,970
can which are used for body networks on
a lot of not a lot of vehicles

373
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:43,130
GM and Honda you single or can't I just
moved away from it but i am still does

374
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,799
and then fault-tolerant we see that I'm
Fiats and the lot of the European the

375
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,830
vehicles had that for a while

376
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:58,158
they will also moved away from as well
they're staying - where can I don't have

377
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,429
a slide here with it but they're they're
coming out with a new version of can bus

378
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,020
called can FD

379
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,670
because eight bytes isn't enough they're
increasing the maximum size up to 64

380
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,620
bytes of data but they're changing the
baud rate mid message

381
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,649
so you bought the beginning baud rate is
five hundred kilobytes and then you

382
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,450
switch over to you know to mega events
in your back to 500 kilotons so so it's

383
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,640
kind of it's just they're cool they're
keeping the frame duration the same it's

384
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,200
just the they're just increasing the
baud rate during the data portion of the

385
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,440
message itself so let's talk about the
message frame itself

386
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,120
so again eight bytes of data for can too
. o 64 crafty

387
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,010
we have two identifier so sometimes you
might hear about the eleventh eye dr the

388
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,040
29th ID or the extended ID sometimes
it's called that's really used to add

389
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,980
more information about the messages are
about the data itself so in a lad like

390
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,880
who the messages from inside of the 29
been something like that

391
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,990
the frame is really very simple and
that's it like if you guys look at a

392
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,640
tcp/ip like if you guys are familiar
with that if you look at that it's you

393
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,450
know each thing is just bunch of lights
just you know this is eight byte is

394
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,930
eight bits next 28 bits next to a trick
that makes the eight bits and that's it

395
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,570
canbus works fundamentally a lot
different it's not eight bits x8 fix it

396
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,639
set for in the data portion

397
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,320
otherwise they're just individual bits
that describe the arbitration idea which

398
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,310
is next to how big the frame is going to
be which is next to the data which sex

399
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:37,190
to the crc so it has a crc inside of the
frame itself to help verify that the

400
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,270
data that was sent is the same data that
was received and then it has this thing

401
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,700
which is very unique to canvas is this
act or acknowledge feel group and so

402
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,690
i'll go over real quick and it and it it
makes it really interesting when you're

403
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,370
working with canbus because especially
if you're new to it

404
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:01,429
this act bit of Zack field essentially
allows all of the receivers to notify

405
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,850
the sender real quickly that

406
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,159
yes i received the data and i received
it correctly

407
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,680
right essentially what happens after the
transmitter sends the data

408
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,600
there's a spot inside of this field
where all where the transmitter is now a

409
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,060
receiver and the receivers are now the
transmitter and what that does is all

410
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,080
the receivers will just essentially
raise your hand and say yes I got it

411
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,649
during this one bit time right here boom
they'll just all say yes but if one

412
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,970
didn't get it

413
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,700
it will then at the next part part of
that bit say no I didn't get it so it

414
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,630
will essentially say that's its chance
for all of them all the other one notes

415
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,970
to say the one that didn't get it to
actually say no the ones that respond in

416
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,720
the first bit will say yes the one to
respond it's a race to raise their hand

417
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,680
and the second bit

418
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,100
they'll say no I didn't get it and what
happens and this is where it's really

419
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,659
really crazy a very very very
fundamental level with canvas

420
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,730
what happens is the transmitter will
roll that message away that is

421
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,860
transmitted all the receivers will throw
their receive message away they'll

422
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,810
notify the application

423
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,310
hey I got an error they won't tell what
happened they won't all of this data is

424
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,490
just thrown into the garbage bit and the
route the application that was

425
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,650
monitoring it will have only limited
information as to what was there and why

426
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,610
it happened

427
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,030
those are also many didn't get it so I
don't wear the transfer is going to

428
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,899
resend it again

429
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,780
okay well guess what transmitter can
only do that so many times before it

430
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,860
will stop

431
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,830
there's a little fault containment and
so if you are a skilled hacker you could

432
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,800
just assert that bit every time that
that that message was sent to sort that

433
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,010
bet for leg as a receiver

434
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,980
you're allowed to do that just assert
that that I didn't get it I didn't get

435
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,430
it

436
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,810
and then after about you know a hundred
and twenty-seven times the transmitter

437
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,740
will just give up

438
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,890
and then you can send your own version
of that message now so it's a little bit

439
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,190
more you know you talk about hey shut up

440
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,670
it's like everybody ignore this guy

441
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,110
I'm gonna do I'm gonna take over you
could totally do that as well so hand

442
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:25,770
bus has many different inherent problems
that if you understand it at a very low

443
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:31,050
level of physical layer it can I can
yield some pretty interesting results so

444
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,470
sometimes we have to use that now
there's some obvious side effects when

445
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,070
you do that you have to you can't just
do it to the one message that the

446
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,159
trailer sending you have to do it to all
of its messages in order to get it to

447
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,850
shut up

448
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,290
but you know if you do - 12 quality
that's not so let's talk a little about

449
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,909
diagnostics because before I was
mentioning all you have a command here

450
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,610
you're going to send a command you
wanted your street received a command

451
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:02,070
diagnostics actually is a little bit war
of this is what the the texts use like

452
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,240
if you go to a dealership they have a
diagnostic scan tool and what this

453
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,559
diagnostics what it allows you to do is
actually be attack right you can go by

454
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,300
the scan tools you can go to ebay get a
text scan tool and do all of these

455
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:15,960
features

456
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,140
there's aftermarket scan tools that
incorporate all of these features as

457
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,030
well but what that allows you to do is
do what's one of the one of my favorite

458
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,940
things is input output control

459
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,090
you want to turn the windshield wipers
on from the canvas from the diagnostic

460
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:36,928
port to send the request and what's
crazy is when the OPM's finally start

461
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,790
locking us out us of the normal messages
that are going to turn that the

462
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,659
controller on

463
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,870
they're going to have a real difficulty
locking this part right

464
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,919
I mean it's going to be a challenge
because they need their texts to also be

465
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,250
able to do these diagnostic controls as
well so it's a big challenge for they

466
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,340
have to weigh that the benefits you know
there's always a way

467
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,240
you know essentially this is a feature
that they've added on purpose and they

468
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,480
want their texts to be able to plug into
that diagnostic and send these control

469
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,110
so what can we do we can potentially can
turn the windshield wipers on okay

470
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,820
boring you know

471
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,710
no it's really interesting to which the
papers off

472
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,270
not on carried a lot to rob somebody
driving down the road which the word is

473
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,840
out

474
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,980
yeah I don't like that turn it off okay
well - Iranian so what's the big deal

475
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,970
right it's not raining to these women
well actually you can also control the

476
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,220
windshield wiper fluid your part

477
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,760
you know just throw that out well I just
turn the windshield wipers I know you

478
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,480
won't

479
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,990
I turn them off for you so there's some
real challenges from that just that

480
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,230
connector itself that when you're
driving down the road

481
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,190
so just be aware of it and whatever

482
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,789
how do we fix that you know do we just
stop

483
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:52,840
diagnostics you know that's the thing
that can you just stop the ability for

484
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,350
the user a new diagnosis so we can just
limit right now

485
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:01,090
the challenges is if I am a user and I
do an input and I tried to turn my

486
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,730
windshield wipers on the system

487
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,450
the Diagnostics has priority and so
maybe we just change the party system

488
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,760
so now the user if they are they turn
the windshield wipers on and they change

489
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,559
that switch it actually overrides the
diagnosis which is probably a good

490
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,049
safety feature

491
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:24,760
so the thing is we're at the mercy of
the controller software right whatever

492
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,740
software is in there who is validating
that it does that right this

493
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,340
the aliens come up to spec they give it
to their supplier and the supplier

494
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,240
follows the spec they give it back there
William test against the suspect that

495
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,760
they did but did they tap that they put
in their spec

496
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,770
hey priority goes to the user typically
no they're not thinking about so we just

497
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,529
had it just remind them a little bit of
a couple but what if you wanted to do it

498
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,460
on your own car

499
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,059
it can be done a lot of fun lock and
unlock are also available if you want to

500
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:59,529
you know build your own little lock the
lock app on your phone which i did a lot

501
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,620
of fun just for myself just how you just
press a button

502
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:08,918
bluetooth unlock your car all their
commands are often sequence

503
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,569
so a lot of times you might especially
the Diagnostics you might have to tell

504
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:20,320
the car going to a diagnostic mode then
tell it to do this thing and then exit

505
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,300
that mode sometimes it's necessary as
well so Lofton sequence and i'll show

506
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,129
you something else that you can do
diagnostics we see if I love it up here

507
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,719
various so another thing that's kind of
cool

508
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:49,359
not just not just can you can you do
certain commands but let's say you were

509
00:34:49,359 --> 00:35:00,310
sad enough okay load problems hopes one
simulation

510
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:08,230
I'm going to turn the filter

511
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:24,880
I was it did it yesterday was Lucien or
I'll try one time doesn't work well

512
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,619
oh you guys can't see it

513
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:42,190
all right whether to work anyways so but
essentially if you wanted to part of

514
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:48,070
Diagnostics is not just I Oh control but
reading memory right so if you want to

515
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:53,830
doubt the firmware of the bunt to do is
ask hey what's what's a memory address

516
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,440
no away Oh XA 0 0 the 0 to give it to me

517
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,410
oh here we go give me five bites of it
and then give me the next five for the

518
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,149
next 5 X 5 such and such

519
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,560
hey you guys walk memory we can see
what's going on in ram what's going on

520
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,450
around not all vehicles allow you to do
that

521
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,140
thank goodness but a lot of do and it's
usually the higher-end controllers the

522
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,129
ones that you are really more interested
in anyways they allow you to just read

523
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,940
the memory out of the controller i use
that a lot for like

524
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,089
reverses . see maybe there's a switch in
memory or maybe a secret key or

525
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:32,400
something that might be interesting for
use later things like that like secret

526
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,780
keys up

527
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,450
maybe security algorithms things like
that you know all that fun stuff so it

528
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,259
could be living in memory now sometimes
you need the security algorithm to ask

529
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,740
the controller to read the memory out
which is smart but then once you have it

530
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:51,420
maybe you can move to the next or you
can get a factory scan tool that are

531
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,790
unlocked for you and then you can just
read the memory out too

532
00:36:53,790 --> 00:37:00,480
so those are some of the challenges as
well look so that's diagnostics of the

533
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,050
others

534
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,260
normal mode messages those are the
messages between the controllers that

535
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,839
sort of the everyday switches and things
like that

536
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,490
am i doing on time my way over and over
but nobody gave me five minutes

537
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:19,319
my that far over my power over how much
that I was right

538
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,790
well get 500k saying my time around
they're like we are but I'm so anyway

539
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:27,960
well okay just making sure

540
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,730
and then quickly quickly go bias in the
news

541
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:39,420
we'll just talk about our hacking that
Charlie bug bounties just happening now

542
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,040
stealing cars you're interested in
people are feeling card now with this

543
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,490
with a lot of this technology a little
bit about some of the tools

544
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,290
arduino has tools and based tools like
the obd2 MX are really cheap honored

545
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,640
hundred bucks could get you into it and
then some of the higher-end tools like

546
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,950
the value can I really nice as well

547
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,339
that's typically what i use but and
there's nothing to train these companies

548
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:09,599
well we do classes and workshops for
school FYI i do a class at black hat

549
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,460
defcon we're doing a workshop if you
guys do we need any private classes a

550
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,460
little sales pitch do private ones as
well

551
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,819
sae has one called the cyber auto
challenge which is actually next week or

552
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:25,710
the week after next and then of course
canvas happen

553
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:31,800
yeah I'm and just a little self another
plug for everybody here actually

554
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,210
we do this thing called a car hacking
village this year we're doing a DEFCON

555
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,830
we're working on getting it at bsides
we're also going to have we have it at

556
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:47,279
Gurk on we hope as well so we're trying
to get it get it everywhere trying to

557
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,060
you know get it get a lot of them out as
well so if you can't make out the defcon

558
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,270
try to get to ger card will have a
smaller version of it

559
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,830
derby as well we're trying to work on
their be as well so we'll see what I

560
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,859
think we got preliminary yeses derby

561
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:05,940
i'm at DEFCON we're gonna have a huge
gonna be huge - you can see 600 square

562
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,630
feet of space and we actually of
Chrysler and delphi are definitely as of

563
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,760
yesterday has agreed to sponsor

564
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,970
so we're going to be in space actually
let they're going to bring their

565
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,189
controllers set them on a desk

566
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,790
it's a hack it when they're going to
bring a car into the space and say you

567
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,540
plug in we don't mind what you gonna do
