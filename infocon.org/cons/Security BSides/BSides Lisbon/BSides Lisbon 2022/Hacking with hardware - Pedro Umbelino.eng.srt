[Music]

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,719
I've collaborated with a bunch of

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,679
different

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,279
initiatives and institutions my

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,119
main line of work is not Hardware

7
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,760
surprisingly it's just my hobby

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,560
there's my my contacts feel free to to

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,359
reach out if you have any questions or

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,460
you want to discuss some cool Hardware

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,820
or not projects

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,180
so what is this talk going to be about

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,100
hacking with Hardware hacking with

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Hardware is not Hardware hacking so we

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,860
are not going to hack into a GPS tracker

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,020
we're not going to break your Samsung

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,620
trying to grab your Bitcoin wallet that

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,100
you forgot the password by some of those

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,280
promises although not not all are

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
starting to materialize in very cool

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,059
gadgets that are used to hacking to

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,100
systems so I want to share my

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,440
experiences my tips my my fails I

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,140
especially some fails that if you're

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,380
starting out they are very painful and

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,299
costly so hopefully you will not repeat

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,280
my my mistakes again

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,040
I want to try to encourage to bring more

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,900
folks into the Hardware's makers

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,780
movement with a security mindset

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,680
we are more as the each day passes but

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
there's there's some space and I think

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,560
the one of the resistances that we had

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,920
into Hardware tinkering was the what I

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
call the analog Multiverse this is just

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
uh something that that I refer as a

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,380
bunch of us probably most of us have a

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,780
strong software engineering background

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,380
right so it's okay when it's binary ones

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,259
and zeros but it's not so so okay when

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,140
we start to talk about resistance

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,780
capacitators soldiering stuff uh and

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,759
there's this resistance into thinking

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,759
this is too hard and people give up

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,579
before they they start trying

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,239
so before I get into that I want to give

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,599
a brief uh historical Hardware device

48
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,420
overview and its creators I think they

49
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,340
lay the ground for for the current times

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,040
of of hacking some of them are just

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,200
Curiosities and and some of them maybe

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,540
some inspirational stories for you

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,879
so I want to start with

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,599
this guy nothing masculine

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,980
11 maskeline was contemporary of uh

56
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,440
Guillermo Marconi so this was around

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,459
1903 it was a British inventor magician

58
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,080
and probably it was the first Wireless

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
hacker although he probably didn't think

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
of himself like that at the time so

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,780
Marconi developed uh Wireless telegraphy

62
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,420
and he had a bunch of

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,239
secure and private communication claims

64
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,760
they had a lot of patents

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,980
masculine was not fan of patents they

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,980
had like maybe an activist mindset he

67
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,560
didn't like the things that Marconi was

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,780
claiming he was able to do and one of

69
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,940
the demonstrations that Marconi did at

70
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,080
the

71
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,620
Royal Institution he was demo his new

72
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,780
technology to secure and private radio

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,659
communication so this was essentially

74
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,720
you cannot predict or know the frequency

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,780
that the transmission was going on so of

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,940
course for us now uh this kind of

77
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,980
security to obscurity does not work and

78
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,959
it's obvious but keep in mind this was

79
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,760
the first days of radio

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,220
so most people didn't even understand

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,799
how that worked and in Marconi's head

82
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,780
you could not figure out which frequency

83
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,519
was being transmitted some communication

84
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,819
so so it was Secure and masculine did

85
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,459
not agree so what it did was that you

86
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,319
learn when this demo was going to happen

87
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,440
at the Royal Institution and it was near

88
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,260
the West End music music also it rented

89
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,420
a house nearby it had a lot of

90
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,299
experience in radio he have he had built

91
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,980
radios and antennas some of them 50

92
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,900
meters high so it was not properly an

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,540
amateur uh although the e was

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,120
self-taught so he rented this house and

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,340
when the demonstration was going on what

96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,680
masculine did was it started to transmit

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Morse code of a very dirty poem so

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
people in the house they started to

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,180
listen the audience most of them knew

100
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,820
how to uh you know understood Morse code

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,080
so they they started to understand

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
something was going on it was a dirty

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,040
poem so so it probably was the first

104
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,380
Wireless hacker in this sense

105
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,520
so moving forward Mary adamski was a

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
Polish mathematician and cryptologist

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,199
that invented the bomba cryptological so

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,320
this is where around

109
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,040
1932 when the Germans created Enigma I'm

110
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,900
pretty sure almost everyone probably

111
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,300
knows what the Enigma machine did was

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,540
kind of to encrypt Communications right

113
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,380
so razowski bought a commercial Enigma

114
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,600
machine and it was very smart he was

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,500
able to reverse engineer

116
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,780
the the

117
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,820
uh using just the commercial version it

118
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,979
was able to reverse engineer the

119
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,100
military version so the the fun part was

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,160
that so the Enigma machine works with a

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,419
set of rotors that have to be

122
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,419
pre-configured in a certain order using

123
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,520
the letters from the alphabet so the

124
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,280
commercial version was uh like the query

125
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,500
it was not exactly QWERTY but configured

126
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,080
like the quality keyboard

127
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,500
and it was trying to understand this was

128
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
fundamental to the crypto Communications

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
and nobody knew how the military one was

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
configured and the British were working

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,280
on this and it just decided to try every

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,259
combination and it started you know at

133
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,139
the alphabetic order ABCD and it worked

134
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,660
at the first time so the British didn't

135
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,400
try this combination because they

136
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
thought it was too obvious they didn't

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
even try to to break the first Enigma

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,180
machine like this so then he produced

139
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,699
kind of Einstein of

140
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,340
um uh Frankenstein sorry of six Enigma

141
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,960
machines and he was able to break codes

142
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,479
in in real time then the Germans found

143
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,940
out it stopped working then came along

144
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,660
Alan Turing uh a man that did too much

145
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,300
work for us to start talking about all

146
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,160
the things that he did we are probably

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,900
here because of him having this

148
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,660
conversation he developed the bomb that

149
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,699
was based on the bomba cryptologic with

150
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,460
some help from from Welshman and they

151
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,199
were able to decrypt Communications in

152
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,979
almost

153
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,979
well real real time for for the time we

154
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,139
can call it almost real time it was

155
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,380
practical to use and it was fundamental

156
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,080
to win the World War II

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
moving again just

158
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,240
Hardware that was made with the specific

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
purpose of hacking into stuff in this

160
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,979
case in the cryptology field

161
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,860
now for the older guys here probably

162
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,139
they know who shot bubbles or Joe

163
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,720
ingressier was

164
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,979
uh it was a famous

165
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,400
character he didn't kind of invented any

166
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,620
hardware I think he was born with a

167
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,440
hardware built in it was uh he was born

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,900
blind it was very interesting in playing

169
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,240
with telephones at the time and and he

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,380
discovered

171
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,440
that by the age seven he discovered that

172
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,840
he could whistle into the phone and

173
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,080
control the telephony network so he was

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
actually able to dial just by whistling

175
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
a perfect pitch

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,919
so this was

177
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,680
a precursor for for a very prolific

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,139
period for for a specific set of hackers

179
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,960
back in the days called freakers and

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,740
Hardware making was involved and I just

181
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,740
want to quickly share a video with you

182
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,660
of him oh

183
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,680
can you hear

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,560
humans by mechanical systems

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,580
to trigger the switches

186
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,520
if you had perfect pets like blind phone

187
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
free Joe and Grecia you could whistle

188
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,580
calls through the network

189
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,360
let's see if I make it this time

190
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,360
now

191
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,649
[Music]

192
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,140
okay it hit the phone it's a little

193
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,940
while he even showed off his skills for

194
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,479
the locals

195
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
um so

196
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,399
yeah the hardware was built in but I

197
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,220
like to talk about Joe bubbles because

198
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,540
he was in the origin of a very very

199
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,240
prolific Hardware hacking and making

200
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,560
period so in the 70s and 60s it was the

201
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,160
Golden Age of freaking uh freaking was

202
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,640
essentially foreign hackers if you will

203
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,100
um one guy very famous also at the time

204
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,100
called John Draper or Captain Crunch uh

205
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,680
he was kind of into it but not much

206
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,320
there was a

207
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,080
a group of also blind folks that were

208
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,940
doing the same thing as Joe ingrasia but

209
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,220
none of them have electrical engineering

210
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,360
background

211
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,580
and they talked to John Draper which had

212
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,899
an electric engineering background

213
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,600
saying look you you we are whistling or

214
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
recording sounds and then playing the

215
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,180
back to the to the network and if we

216
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,220
could just have some kind of device that

217
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,399
we dial in and

218
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,779
produces the exact frequencies that we

219
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,080
want it will be much easier so

220
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,959
it was a period where boxes started to

221
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,720
appear like the blue box the red box the

222
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,220
there's a lot of boxes it was

223
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,279
essentially each box had a function uh

224
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,560
how to hack into networks like placing

225
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,300
long distance phone calls and and you

226
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,300
wouldn't pay at the time uh phone calls

227
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,000
were very expensive not not like today

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,580
so again a lot of Hardware that was made

229
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,399
just for the purpose of hiking into

230
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,100
systems now moving a bit forward uh van

231
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,980
Heck if you heard about Tempest which is

232
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,800
not exactly uh it's a specification but

233
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,360
this guy was in the origin of of of that

234
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
that word so to speak so he invented

235
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,920
this device

236
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,440
which essentially it could point and

237
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,279
antenna 20 CRT screen and have the

238
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,320
screen being reproduced in its own

239
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
screen so he could see what was on the

240
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,500
computer screen uh 100 200 300 meters

241
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,459
away

242
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,180
so it was deemed not possible but he

243
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,220
proved it was possible very cheap and

244
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,680
almost off the shelf components

245
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,399
so then if we move forward to 1998 we we

246
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,459
have the Deep crack that was a piece of

247
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,260
Hardware specifically designed also to

248
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,320
to break into cryptography in this this

249
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,440
case the purpose was to really

250
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,779
demonstrate that Des was was broken and

251
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,180
should not be used it was known by the

252
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,040
cryptologist community for a long time

253
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,220
but this was the demonstration in

254
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,000
Practical use that it was not saved

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,519
so

256
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,279
uh several things were happening in this

257
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,220
period so the the internet kind of was

258
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,740
born so the the community started to to

259
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,600
grain strength and share knowledge on

260
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,640
the internet vendors started to produce

261
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,459
uh more accessible devices and cheaper

262
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,040
there was the Peaks the basic stamps the

263
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,980
avrs they were very commonplace into

264
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,380
building lots of of Hardware projects

265
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,480
and then came along with websites like

266
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,779
eBay and Alibaba then paved the road for

267
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,839
a very cheap components so it was

268
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,640
getting more and more accessible to

269
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,120
start to play around with hardware

270
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,380
at the same time the hackerspace

271
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,560
movements were were kind of growing up

272
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,980
in a lot of different cities and Arduino

273
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,459
was created Arduino was if you look back

274
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,779
a very important tool because kind of

275
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,740
crystallized some of the stuff that the

276
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,440
teachers wanted to to to teach so it was

277
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,760
a great platform to teach later

278
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Raspberry Pi did the same

279
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,459
now we have esps and other chips that

280
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,380
you know you can connect everything to

281
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,140
the internet nowadays which is sometimes

282
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,720
not a very good idea but people keep

283
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,040
doing it

284
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,220
and and then there's a lot of online PCB

285
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,079
maker services that you can actually

286
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,120
order your PCB sometimes you can

287
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
actually order for them to be a symbol

288
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,540
at the price that is not prohibitive

289
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,820
so that's why I think today we live in

290
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,680
privileged times for for Hardware office

291
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,019
obvious there's a abundance of online

292
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,019
information there's Community the

293
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,120
hardware parts are cheap and you can

294
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,160
just buy a starting kit of wherever

295
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,380
piece of technology that you are

296
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,240
interesting so do it yourself and kind

297
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,700
of learn how that worked and we saw

298
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,300
uh since 2019

299
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,800
till today there's a lot of new devices

300
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,560
here that did not exist I think at in

301
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,260
2019 I think everybody knows that those

302
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,600
eyes and faces the panagachi nobody

303
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,339
talks about pedagogy anymore because we

304
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,899
have a new mascot uh new aquatic mammal

305
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,940
mammal that people some some have

306
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,500
already and some are still waiting for

307
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,779
it to arrive The Flipper which is a

308
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,880
great great tool

309
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,220
so

310
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,860
this was kind of how we get to today as

311
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,920
a community for for me for myself it all

312
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,260
started with that little guy over there

313
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,740
actually that one but I had a spectrum

314
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,540
when I was eight

315
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,240
I read my first program when I was 10 by

316
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
reading the manuals then I I got a PC

317
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,700
rather late I had I was 14 at the time

318
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
already and of course I got my first

319
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,920
computer virus and this was kind of what

320
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,519
started it all I had a friend of mine

321
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,220
that asked if two these drives were near

322
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,079
to each other if the other one would

323
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,660
become infected okay

324
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,360
I knew it was impossible but I also

325
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,120
could not explain to him why how the

326
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,820
virus propagate how do they work and

327
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,740
that question was in back of my mind

328
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,639
like I think the analogy that we chose

329
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,880
for virus uh make sense for us as a

330
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,519
community but but for the people that

331
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,540
have no info info knowledge information

332
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,940
technology knowledge for example

333
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,579
um they think it works like a normal

334
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,320
biological virus right so it's it's it's

335
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,839
a valid question so I bought an assembly

336
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,240
book and I start to reverse engineer

337
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,300
baratas until I understood how it worked

338
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,699
and then I learned Pascal but yes I know

339
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,839
Pascal by by 16 years old it was at what

340
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,579
I had and then the internet came and the

341
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,279
internet changed everything a lot of

342
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
knowledge was uh accessible you can

343
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,680
start to source for parts and learn new

344
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,820
stuff

345
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,120
and actually in the University I found

346
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,399
this this device still in my house it's

347
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,399
completely full of rest but that was my

348
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,860
first decent Hardware it was a 266

349
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,380
256 with memory that starts an

350
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,639
encryption key

351
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,279
and I wrote some programs my computer

352
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,380
will need this to unlock itself of

353
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,199
course it had batteries inside and it

354
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,300
was volatile memory so when the

355
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,540
batteries died I had to you know format

356
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,019
my computer still

357
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,839
I produce more gizmos mainly to

358
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,940
interface with pay phones and stuff like

359
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,100
that that I will not share with you in

360
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,000
the stock

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,040
uh and then I built some other stuff

362
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,519
and my what I always try to do is to to

363
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,199
I don't have an electrical engineering

364
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,040
background so uh to avoid the analog

365
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,779
Multiverse what I try to do is figure

366
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,760
out modules how do they work how do you

367
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,980
communicate with each other and bring

368
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,380
whatever I want to do as fast as I can

369
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,160
to the digital world meaning uh I if I

370
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,220
can I will Implement a filter using

371
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,380
software instead of capacitators I know

372
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,120
it's not right to do but since I'm

373
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,699
producing a prototype I can do it and if

374
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,860
it works and if I want to make some

375
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,600
product to commercialize for example

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,399
then I will talk to an electrical

377
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,199
engineer and it will help me figure out

378
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,180
the perfect solution but you don't need

379
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,579
to worry about everything when you're

380
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,380
just producing a prototype just just

381
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,000
make it happen

382
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,220
especially if you just read the fine

383
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,139
documentation you'll find a lot of

384
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,579
information about every ship set

385
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,639
nowadays and and you take your time to

386
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,320
read it and you can interface almost

387
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,779
everything just by yourself if it's not

388
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,400
very small to Soldier but we'll get into

389
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,240
that

390
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
so

391
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
I'm going to share my Hardware building

392
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,140
approach like your mileage may vary it's

393
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,260
my Approach it's it's as valid as as as

394
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,040
another I guess it works for me and

395
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,520
usually it has a bunch of phases so

396
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,319
of course there's a motivation when I

397
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,359
start some project we I'm going to base

398
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,240
the second part of the presentation on a

399
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
device that I'll be built called io433

400
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,340
there was some motivation behind it how

401
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,620
it why I started to build the thing or

402
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,900
thinking about building then I tried to

403
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
Define properly Define which features

404
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
and how how do I want the this this

405
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,799
project to look like and I you'll do a

406
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,780
bit of research Which models can you use

407
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,580
to implement the functions that you are

408
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,460
looking for to make it work then you get

409
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
to the design part where you see that

410
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,059
your computer you actually design the

411
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,100
PCB and the computers you Source the

412
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,440
parts fabricate test and just Loop it

413
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,419
and try to figure out what went wrong

414
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,080
because things will go wrong of course

415
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,360
so for this particular project

416
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,200
my motivation was as usual necessity I

417
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,620
lost my my garage door opener okay so

418
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,860
yeah I'm I think of myself as as a

419
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,320
hacker so why why would I buy a garage

420
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,559
door opener very expensive like 40 euros

421
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,539
when I can spend a lot more money trying

422
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,780
to build one myself so

423
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,400
yeah I had I always had this uh urge to

424
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
hack into this kind of devices like door

425
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,240
opener sensors and things that work on

426
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,640
the 43 megahertz so this was the perfect

427
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,460
excuse and then I think okay if

428
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,440
something cool comes out of this I can

429
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,940
publish the code like share the code

430
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,039
harder my results and stuff stuff like

431
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,600
that but I was just trying to build a

432
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,039
remote okay

433
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,580
so this was not io43 yet

434
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,120
um

435
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,500
then

436
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,380
I had some issues to reverse engineer

437
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,600
the remote I had to understand how

438
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
frequencies work and I had to sniff the

439
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,740
transmissions and

440
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,780
I could have some tool that could you

441
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,000
know make my job easier then I started

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,559
to think about and learn there's a lot

443
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,220
of applications that usually use this

444
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,980
particular frequency to communicate like

445
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,220
animometers remote Keys thermometers I

446
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,840
don't know Wireless plugs water stations

447
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,179
whatever

448
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,799
and maybe if I have some kind of

449
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,340
multi-tool that for 433 that helped me I

450
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,320
I could develop a remote uh faster so

451
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,460
the i o 433 was born at kind of at the

452
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,740
same time I was trying to clone a remote

453
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,539
it was not a remote it was something

454
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,220
that I wish I had that will help me

455
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,860
build the remote so I built this boat at

456
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,080
the same time kind of so essentially

457
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,299
when I get to the definition I said Okay

458
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,940
I want a sniffer that can store replay

459
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,320
and dump and monitor signals it would be

460
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,440
cool if you had some some other features

461
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,940
but this is this is where I want to

462
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,160
start

463
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,280
it has to be able to replay and analyze

464
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,740
signals so so that's the way I can build

465
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,860
another uh garage door opener so that

466
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,400
was the first features that I want when

467
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,780
I started I know there were some

468
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
projects that could do similar things

469
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,919
you could use software defined and radio

470
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,660
to analyze signals and replay it with

471
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,700
your computer for example

472
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,559
and there was a promise at the time

473
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,860
because this is not a new project that a

474
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,559
new like I said the Aquatic mammal The

475
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,200
Flipper was going to be born I'm not

476
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,240
sure if the they started the kickstarter

477
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
campaign just a bit before or after I

478
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,500
started this this project

479
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,080
but it would took it would take a long

480
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,360
time so I just did it myself so in in

481
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,360
the research phase as I was saying I

482
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,679
just broke down the project for

483
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,260
functionalities and I searched for for

484
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,240
parts that could perform whatever I

485
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,220
wanted to do so I wanted to be able to

486
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,900
sniff and to replay if there's some

487
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,419
particular chipset that already does

488
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,160
this how can I interface with this

489
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,000
chipset uh and so forth and if it is

490
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,980
easy or not for me to implement it

491
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,620
myself or should I use modules instead

492
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,440
of trying to design the entire thing

493
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,140
and of course uh reading the

494
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,480
documentation helped me

495
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I also did a bit of research about how

496
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,120
signals work in the 433 megahertz bands

497
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,140
like

498
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,120
are we talking about modulations like

499
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,480
ask FSK

500
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,460
ask's amplitude Chief King it means that

501
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,500
when there's a signal being transmitted

502
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,620
it works a bit like Morse code if you

503
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,900
want or imagine a light bulb going on

504
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,100
and off and it's the transmission being

505
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,039
kind of transmitted sorry and and and

506
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,679
and radio silence and that's amplitude

507
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,900
Chief King there's frequency shifting so

508
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,659
I had to kind of reverse my own remote

509
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,500
and figure out uh which one will I be

510
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,340
using

511
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,380
so

512
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,659
so the functionality is read write 43

513
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,780
Mega signals I want it to be portable

514
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,120
ideally with with the battery and a

515
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,580
graphic user interface I want to be able

516
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,620
to store signals and to connect to the

517
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,080
PC and and decode the signals in in real

518
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,659
time if I want and not in the platform

519
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,799
you can see the the upper side

520
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,919
is the remotes so the remotes that I

521
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,260
were able I was able to clone it was

522
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,659
based on on

523
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:39,360
fs1000a and and other chipsets but they

524
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,100
were kind of not enough for what I

525
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,780
wanted to do with the i o they were

526
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,140
enough to open my garage door but not to

527
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,440
sniff all signals so in in the bottom

528
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,240
side you see the first the very first

529
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,720
prototype uh with the ticc 1101 which is

530
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,740
the antenna one and then the SP 32 with

531
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,520
with a small display

532
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,280
so

533
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
research

534
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,940
now I knew what I wanted well before the

535
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,080
before building the the actual device uh

536
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,059
when you're into this part you should

537
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,400
you should elect your electronic design

538
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,980
automation software so this is

539
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,720
essentially the software where you

540
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,720
design the schematic and usually you

541
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
design the schematic and is the the

542
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,860
software itself is able to also produce

543
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,400
the board and the copper traces and so

544
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,440
forth there are several available

545
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,559
there's ego there's Kika there's

546
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,620
commercial programs there are free ones

547
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,100
also you should if you're starting now

548
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,320
you should try a very small project like

549
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,980
a LED blinking and design it from from

550
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,039
zero to board to to having the actual

551
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,780
board produced

552
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,240
and and understand which one do you want

553
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,720
I I don't I don't have a favorite I use

554
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,240
usually ego because I started with eagle

555
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,539
they are not very user friendly I don't

556
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,460
think they are there are some stuff that

557
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,900
takes a lot of work to learn how to do

558
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,600
in one and if there's changes in in

559
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,900
other piece of software I I don't want

560
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,120
to lose a lot of time just learning a

561
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,419
new Eda so it will be wise to select uh

562
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,900
one first like eagle has a free version

563
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,679
but it's also a paid version if you want

564
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,580
to build bigger projects and for me

565
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,620
I should probably have thought about

566
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,380
this advice before choosing ego but now

567
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,700
it's late

568
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,280
so choose your parts wisely also you

569
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,780
have to decide are you going to make the

570
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,059
PCB are you going to order the piece

571
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,919
like if you want to actually etch the

572
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,440
PCB yourself or are you ordering the PCB

573
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,440
are you going to hand Soldier it uh are

574
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,299
you going to order the symbol and spend

575
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,820
a bit more money this is all decisions

576
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,500
in the design process

577
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,100
so last year uh last Visa as I I

578
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,799
presented very more complicated project

579
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,380
than this one this is super super simple

580
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,200
if if you want to start soldiering stuff

581
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,760
and in the end have a very cool device

582
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,799
that can hack into garage doors and

583
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,720
stuff stuff like that

584
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,840
so it's essentially just a PCB world so

585
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,299
it was designing Eagle uh

586
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,179
uh and I didn't have to worry about

587
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,779
package types or smds or or I just had

588
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,220
to worry about the design which is

589
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,080
essentially keep it simple

590
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,260
and I did uh it's a breakout board where

591
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,440
you can buy two modules You Soldiers the

592
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,539
two modules together and it's done and

593
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,880
it's working and and you can do a lot of

594
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,260
interesting stuff

595
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,000
so

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,220
so but if you're doing more complicated

597
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,720
stuff then you have to worry about

598
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,720
package types you have to understand the

599
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,539
difference between a dip for example

600
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,200
package type and and

601
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,059
keyfn and if you look at your badge in

602
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,299
the back you can kind of see the spacing

603
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,820
differences if you want to hand Soldier

604
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,520
those components by yourself some of

605
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,159
them in the design phase if there's a

606
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,020
chip available for example in different

607
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,419
packaging types you should be wise and

608
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,980
choose one that you can actually hand

609
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,039
solder if you're going to do it yourself

610
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,020
otherwise you're in trouble

611
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,020
then there's a lot of them so

612
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,059
then you have to know about s and D

613
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,120
sizes if you're using seminal components

614
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,020
like resistors and and capacitators

615
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,720
you should look careful before you order

616
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,779
because there are some sizes that in the

617
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,880
metric code and Imperial code the code

618
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
is the same but the size is really

619
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,620
really differ again if you look into

620
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,179
your badge I once ordered a full reel of

621
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,880
zero six zero three components that I

622
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,640
was going to end Soldier but instead of

623
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,039
ordering Imperial I ordered the metric

624
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,559
one and if you look at the size of the

625
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,100
0603 metric one try to soldier that by

626
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,500
hand good luck so

627
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,120
be careful when you're choosing

628
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,719
components

629
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,940
then when when you're designing uh

630
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,520
choose a choose a Eda that has outer

631
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,279
root every every idea nowadays have auto

632
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,880
route Auto routing is just the

633
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,880
translation of the your schematic

634
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,279
connections into the copper traces so if

635
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,020
if your project is small enough you can

636
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,700
do it by hand and optimize it by hand

637
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,700
it's fun but it doesn't have to grow a

638
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,700
lot so it becomes impossible to actually

639
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,779
root all the wires by hand so so yes

640
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:48,240
this in this case the on the middle it's

641
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,200
the the io433 here on the right was the

642
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,620
2019 project it was a bit harder to to

643
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,820
root by hand uh it was a it was called

644
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,940
Uber heat and had a bunch of neat

645
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,919
features that I thought before I talked

646
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,799
before so in the end this was the PCB

647
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,919
advice double check before production

648
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,779
you can see here there's the version 0.1

649
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,419
and 0.2 because again I failed to listen

650
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,000
to my own advices and uh

651
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,179
so I wanted to support more boards and

652
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,760
quickly found out that I produced and

653
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,340
order a bunch of pcbs that were not

654
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,440
compatible with some of the more

655
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,480
accessible

656
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,000
chipsets that I was using

657
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,600
so I had to do everything again and make

658
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,720
another board that now has this uh on

659
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,900
off jumper switch which uh what what

660
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,260
that does is it actually supports like

661
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,020
the device here so it actually supports

662
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,720
different modules just by you you just

663
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,760
select the soldier jumper there you can

664
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,620
choose between two models some of them

665
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,900
are easier to find than the others to

666
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
control the 43 megahertz communication

667
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,700
so and then you just burn a different

668
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,380
firmware

669
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,580
so

670
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,559
when you're sourcing the parts choose

671
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,440
your vendor for the PCB and components

672
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,659
sometimes they sell just the PCB

673
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:15,600
sometimes you can or in the same uh

674
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
vendor you can order the PCB the

675
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,279
components and the assembly all in one

676
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,260
there are some cool ones and very

677
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,440
accessible nowadays

678
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,539
usually the the shipping speed versus

679
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,960
money is important because most things

680
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,419
come from China and uh

681
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,320
if you pcbs tend to be heavy

682
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,419
when you're just designing one not it's

683
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,640
not heavy but for example the badges

684
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,419
this year were 13 kilos of badges so

685
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,760
that costs a lot uh when you're Cheap

686
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,940
shipping right be careful when choosing

687
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,980
components we thought for about future

688
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,020
availability of the parts which was a

689
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,500
problem for this because the io433 the

690
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,059
parts that you need for it are still

691
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,860
available but you see there's there's

692
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,760
another uh version of the ships being

693
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
produced so it's harder and harder to

694
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
find a specific version to that supports

695
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,419
the the same the same peanuts for

696
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,200
example

697
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,140
and in in projects that make sense uh

698
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,320
get this PCB stencil the stencil

699
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,620
is that metallic uh sheet that's

700
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,559
perforated with the right sizing when

701
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,659
you're hand sold during small components

702
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,360
so essentially you put the PCB board

703
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,380
below and you put the the the metallic

704
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,380
sheet above and you spread Soldier and

705
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,659
then it becomes a lot more easy if

706
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,460
you're solving soldering very small

707
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,539
parts

708
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,940
so you don't need high-tech or expensive

709
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,940
gear you just need to practice myself I

710
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,919
usually travel with one of those

711
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,220
soldering irons that it's gas powered so

712
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,320
you don't even need electricity and you

713
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,580
can just uh by unscrewing the the tip it

714
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,039
becomes a hot air gun so it's two in one

715
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,960
it's super cheap

716
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,600
you can order this starting kits just to

717
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,720
try and and practice uh drag Soldier or

718
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,460
hot air Soldier uh

719
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,919
other than that you need a multimeter if

720
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,600
you want to spend a bit more money you

721
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,059
can order an oscilloscope like this one

722
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,360
which is also cheap around 150 Euros I

723
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,140
think

724
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,020
and infrared thermometer if a lot of

725
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,559
things start to produce smoke don't

726
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,890
don't touch it like

727
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,760
[Music]

728
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,720
a burnt chip can go up to 500 Degrees

729
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,440
so your your your your skin will just

730
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,419
slide off when you you touch something

731
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:48,059
very hot I I know how that works

732
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:51,720
fortunately so yeah then you come to the

733
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,700
testing phase you just figure out if

734
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,260
things start to go wrong

735
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,919
and just Loop iterate the process start

736
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,200
by going to the schematics to see if

737
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
there's a routing issue of you you

738
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,580
choose the wrong combination or you

739
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,279
connect some the pin out uh some

740
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,679
somewhat wrong if everything is okay

741
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,720
then go to the PCB to see if the

742
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,600
corporate races were were badly designed

743
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,720
and and start to work start to test this

744
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,580
each connection for connectivity so

745
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,860
there's there's a bunch of work involved

746
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,440
that that it's in the testing phase if

747
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
things don't work at first and they

748
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
won't I'm sorry

749
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,159
it takes some time and practice for

750
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,080
things to work so this was kind of the

751
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,960
evolution of the the i o uh on the upper

752
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
left you can see the remotes that were

753
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,620
Arduino based

754
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,480
and then the evolution into something

755
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
with an asp that has a screen so I can

756
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,679
actually program a graphic user

757
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:47,880
interface

758
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,659
on the upper right side it was this uh

759
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,059
it was a very small it was actually uh

760
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,460
the the remote for for my door

761
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,460
uh and then the first prototypes and

762
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,320
then the prototypes that had like a 3D

763
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,080
casing that you can download it's all on

764
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,340
GitHub

765
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,520
you can actually Soldier and and use the

766
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,100
case like this put a small battery and

767
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,320
you can go and hack garage doors but

768
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,380
please not mine so this is the the final

769
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,860
the final revision uh I already talked

770
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,200
about the some mistakes that I did with

771
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,200
with the PCB the green one and the black

772
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,799
one so I have some some here

773
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,460
um

774
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,539
so essentially what iot

775
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,899
io433 prototype become is an open source

776
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:40,200
esp32 and cc1101 based sniffer has

777
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,240
Bluetooth low energy and Wi-Fi

778
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,200
capabilities I'm not using it now in

779
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,480
this in this firmware because I'm

780
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,519
waiting for very smart people like

781
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,620
yourselves to come join and help me with

782
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,519
the firmware you can order the parts

783
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,980
online and just those some wires or you

784
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,740
can actually order the PCB or ask me for

785
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,620
one PCB to sold your yourself I have

786
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,099
some if you want and then 3D print the

787
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,899
case and it looks very professional like

788
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,399
this so

789
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,399
yeah feel free to join in I will try and

790
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,940
make a demo I wanted to bring

791
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,159
my garage door but it's too big to fit

792
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,679
my car so I'll just uh I'll just demo it

793
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,240
with a doorbell I know

794
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:29,820
I just connect this

795
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,219
buffing reindeer so you can also hear

796
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,480
the

797
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,099
hopefully if Murphy was allowed

798
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,399
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm

799
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,440
going to replay the signal and record it

800
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,659
here it's it's hard to see I cannot show

801
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,179
you but trust me I'm I will not press

802
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,619
this button

803
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,520
now recording

804
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,119
and replaying

805
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,599
no

806
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,660
wait I have time we'll do it again

807
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,040
replay

808
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,279
awesome

809
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,200
okay

810
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,240
well I have a lucky charm here so I'll

811
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,140
try and copy it again

812
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,500
Okay so

813
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,640
wash it up

814
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,900
and again

815
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,859
so it this is just a replay no no you

816
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,320
can stop

817
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,619
this is just someone is using uh I know

818
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,900
thank you

819
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,180
okay I could detect it here like it said

820
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,480
flipper zero being used to screw up your

821
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,820
presentation so yeah

822
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,520
so this does a lot more than just

823
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,440
replaying you can actually connect it

824
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,820
with your serial port to your computer

825
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,099
analyze the signal in real time if you

826
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,920
want to have some scripts running or or

827
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,980
detect uh spoofed signals and things

828
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,800
like that or you can just use it to to

829
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,920
play around and also ruin other people's

830
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,400
presentations so

831
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,020
so essentially this is what I wanted to

832
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
share with you guys I think we live in a

833
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,880
fantastic time to Tinker with Hardware

834
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,339
anyone can make it uh you don't have to

835
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,560
make very complicated projects nowadays

836
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,599
with with the amount of of different

837
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,880
chipsets that we have available to

838
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,740
really produce useful devices and

839
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,599
prototypes that you can use while

840
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,900
hacking I think we are getting our our

841
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,079
own promised Hollywood style gadgets and

842
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,300
there's so much more to be invented if

843
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,660
you just have the courage to to invest a

844
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,579
bit more into Hardware making and take

845
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,400
that that step please join in I'm sure

846
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,200
you can do it too

847
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,280
so thank you oh this is also a hardware

848
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,700
device

849
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,440
so thank you very much better any

850
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,839
questions still have quite some time

851
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,660
okay there's one question here

852
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,300
no

853
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,700
stuff

854
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,880
hello Pedro in terms of financials what

855
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,440
are we talking about a prototype like

856
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,280
that

857
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,619
yeah so

858
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,900
so the components for building one

859
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,300
prototype like the last time I saw

860
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,540
Chinese Parts kind of really got a lot

861
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,619
of expensive nowadays probably they they

862
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,560
grew by 100 I guess the price but let's

863
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,520
say the ttgo goes around for nowadays

864
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,380
maybe 20 dollars

865
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,820
uh and the the cc1101 goes around for

866
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,320
maybe five so 25 uh and you can then you

867
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,599
buy a battery or use a very of another

868
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,420
device so all in all I'll guess you

869
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,460
spend like 30 bucks building building

870
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,040
this it was much cheaper at the time

871
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,740
when it started

872
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,020
uh if you want to order the PCB then

873
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,560
it's probably better if you uh join with

874
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,140
some friends and order some bigger and

875
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,920
bulkier order but but there are websites

876
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,200
that support makers and you can actually

877
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,119
order like just five

878
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,640
and they they ship it for two dollars

879
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,579
and and if you just ask for five you can

880
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,859
get very low prices yeah

881
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,060
okay thank you cheap fun

882
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,078
questions

883
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,400
three two one

884
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,300
yeah where

885
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,760
there's somewhere yeah

886
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,859
hey Pedro awesome presentation thank you

887
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,540
um would it be possible to use something

888
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,240
similar to a breadboard instead of just

889
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,839
going out and print the PCB absolutely

890
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,680
the the reason you want to print the PCB

891
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,839
is that when you print the 3D case it

892
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,440
just slides it's the only reason you can

893
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,660
in this project which is a very simple

894
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,660
project you can actually Soldiers the

895
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,960
the wires or just use a breadboard and

896
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,760
it's the same thing okay perfect thank

897
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,880
you

898
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,520
anyone else anymore

899
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,220
another great presentation thank you and

900
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,859
uh what other device do you know that um

901
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,160
talk in that uh

902
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,079
megahertz or Hertz that you already had

903
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,640
fun with

904
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,579
that I had fun with yeah uh if you can

905
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,380
tell us yes

906
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,480
well there are wells they do it like

907
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,160
garage door opener doorbells there's

908
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,660
there's also

909
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,160
uh

910
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,500
uh in the agricultural sector there's

911
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,359
there's a bunch of devices that are

912
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,900
based on 423 to monitor the growth of

913
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,780
trees in particular I don't know about a

914
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,079
big Olive Tree Plantation that uses this

915
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,839
to monitor the growth and the watering

916
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,560
and of course it's completely insecure

917
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,020
it's just you can ruin an entire crop

918
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,000
just by watering or turning off the

919
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,780
water uh any this device has a quite

920
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,480
powerful antenna so it

921
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,839
yes there's there it's a field that is

922
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,720
not very been very explored because I

923
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,359
think everyone assumes it's just uh

924
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,400
broken

925
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,839
uh but yeah

926
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,339
thank you

927
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,299
one on this side

928
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,320
thank you better

929
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,960
um just one question about the io433 do

930
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,599
you have some uh road map or Evolution

931
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,540
things that you wanted to do more that

932
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,880
aren't currently being implemented or

933
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,980
something like that yes absolutely my

934
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,980
roadmap is coming to besides to share

935
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,980
this with you and uh hopefully thank you

936
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,560
people who helped join and develop from

937
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,680
no I don't have a particular roadmap for

938
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,380
this it it was a hobby project it can

939
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,060
grow or not if the community is

940
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,260
interested I'm not planning on

941
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,480
commercializing or whatever uh the the

942
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,820
plans are available there online like I

943
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,560
said I ordered a bunch of pcbs that I

944
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,740
can give some and either things go from

945
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,180
there or not there are commercial

946
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,839
available projects nowadays that do kind

947
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,420
of the same thing this is another one if

948
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,099
you want to understand and play around

949
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,200
and and develop for your own personal

950
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,500
growth because there are some

951
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,660
things that maybe you cannot do with

952
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,520
other other people's firmware that you

953
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,920
can do with this so yeah

954
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,520
thank you

955
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,220
anyone else

956
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,599
I guess that wraps it up

957
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,640
thanks again thank you for everything

958
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,420
and your talk

959
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,930
[Applause]
