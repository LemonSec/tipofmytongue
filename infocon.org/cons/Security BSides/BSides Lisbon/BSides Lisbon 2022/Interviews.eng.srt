1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,720
foreign

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
event

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,779
so after the pandemic we felt that it

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,060
was really needed to come back and to

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,099
put everyone together again

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,240
it is indeed an important event due to

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,720
the fact that you know the Raiders are a

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,700
lot of awareness to the people here in

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,040
Lisbon about security and how they

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
should act let's say in some cases so

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,640
yeah it's a great and actually the event

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,160
was great it was very nice event very

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,800
well organized I have been in a lot of

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,020
events similar events and this one was

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,320
great

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,360
lots of companies are involved in a in

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,059
sponsoring that event

18
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,980
but it's still not at solo commercial

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,440
event really love it the practitioners

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,360
and the attendees are usually passionate

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,719
and really came from the quality of the

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,880
of the talks and of the networking that

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,540
we can have around here

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,860
here we can hear technical stuff and to

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,100
to talk about technique and to to

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,200
discuss

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,759
from technique at the technical level

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,820
so it's very very I identifiable with

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,860
the DNA of our company that is core

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
technical people so that's why this

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,479
event is so important because

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,060
effectively we identify ourselves with

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,360
the culture of this type of events that

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,540
is very much focused in technology in

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,560
people networking people exchanging deep

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,259
knowledge regarding cyber security and

37
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,780
not so much in sales not like a

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,380
commercial event you know

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,180
most of the the talks and so on and

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,720
people are expert in this area it's a an

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,939
opportunity we have to connect with all

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,159
these people not only the knowledge and

43
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,659
the information they give you is

44
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,419
important but also all the Insight of

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,940
what is happening around the world

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,790
[Music]

47
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,070
[Applause]

48
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,220
[Music]

49
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,160
and today I talked about how we can

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,560
Bridge observability

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,959
and security

52
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,260
and as an industry as practitioners we

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,060
start to understand how observability

54
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,480
can be used to secure systems and today

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,120
I discussed how we can use observability

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,140
to also attack systems

57
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,580
my talk today was about leader of

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,300
actions and securing the the workflows

59
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,280
for deployments and other automations

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,160
around GitHub I explain how to use

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,400
mathematics and cryptography to build

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,280
techniques that can defeat any tool to

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,319
detect data leak because most of the

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,760
technique nowadays make data

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,200
store data yes so the whole point was to

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,060
show some really cool tricks that you

67
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,560
can do in the kernel that you cannot do

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,140
in user mode and hopefully create some

69
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,580
curiosity around it and I have some

70
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,640
people join in yeah I was hoping my

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,760
lecture would try to inspire folks into

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,340
coming into Hardware buildings and make

73
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,239
clears world and try to make security

74
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,900
devices using Hardware either to hack

75
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,659
into stuff break into stuff or to defend

76
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,819
also it's also valid points for example

77
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,799
are getting all connected to the

78
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:44,700
internet

79
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,640
and I think you will see like in 10 or

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,799
20 years you will want to buy a light

81
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,519
bulb or or a toaster that's not

82
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,959
connected to the internet they won't

83
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,640
exist anymore everything will be

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,680
connected and that just represents

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,400
additional text surface additional food

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,440
places that attackers can gain into your

87
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,379
network either your own network or

88
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,959
company Network and that will complicate

89
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,200
the device as security practitioners a

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,920
lot

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,139
and I think we should start paying

92
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,180
attention of what makes sense to be

93
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,880
connected and online and what doesn't

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,660
so my name is marimo and I'm 100

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,580
dependent on a pacemaker which is

96
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,620
generating every single bit of my heart

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,460
I'm also a security researcher so I

98
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,440
started a hacking project to figure out

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,020
if my connected pacemaker can be hacked

100
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,720
Yeah so basically developers are not

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
properly testing regular Expressions on

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,639
back-ends and that's a big problem

103
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,699
because slight modifications in the user

104
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,160
input can lead to Great damage in

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,020
systems we all use and depend on

106
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,780
so basically we our talk was on web

107
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,900
isolation and the key takeaways is that

108
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,040
doing a good web isolation should be

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,320
designed around three principles the

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,440
first one is the units of isolation so

111
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,199
the compartment size the second one is

112
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,780
the isolation materials which should be

113
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,540
strong enough to withstand the threats

114
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,479
that we're facing and finally visibility

115
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
and user friendliness are very critical

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
otherwise no one will use the web

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,020
isolation solution

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,139
[Music]

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,919
thank you

120
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,940
since we we selected Lisbon to be a

121
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,419
central hub for our technology area we

122
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,360
thought that would be good to invest in

123
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
this event so

124
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,560
we find cyber security of course one of

125
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,720
the key points to keeping our

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,880
information safe

127
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
communities kind of our secret Source

128
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
like we believe very strongly in the

129
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,699
power of communities getting together

130
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,520
build a great products doing good things

131
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,220
in the world and for me besides is the

132
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,620
purest expression of that in in the

133
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,120
security industry these are the places

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
where technologists and practitioners

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
get together and you know Network and

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
talk about things that we can really

137
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,880
solve so I'm Philip I work for elastic

138
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm a developer Advocate I've been with

139
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,259
the company for almost six and a half

140
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,600
years so that's what I've been doing for

141
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,539
a long time so elastic was founded kind

142
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,220
of like in the community and it's very

143
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,380
relevant for us to stay close to that

144
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,780
and it's kind of like the continuous

145
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,580
innovation that we we get from working

146
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,560
with the people of how they build things

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,240
and how they use our products

148
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,410
foreign

149
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,289
[Music]

150
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,460
it's a great opportunity to meet with

151
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,180
the community show what we've been doing

152
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,000
talk a little bit about what's next and

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,780
also to share that we're here

154
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,020
and uh as data dog we're also expanding

155
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,539
to Lisbon starting an office here doing

156
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,580
product development and just wanted

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,979
people to to be aware and we can start

158
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,340
to to be part of this uh this community

159
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,039
so I see this somewhat as a

160
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,340
responsibility for Deloitte as a global

161
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,860
company that works a lot in this field

162
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,620
to to support these kinds of events

163
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,419
where awareness is created regarding

164
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,120
cyber security where

165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,000
immense knowledge is

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,800
distributed between all the participants

167
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,080
and I think that's That's essential for

168
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
our day-to-day

169
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,780
lives yeah besides Lisbon brings in the

170
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,819
