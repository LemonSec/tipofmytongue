[Music]

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,440
thank you for

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,900
being here and I'm very happy to be

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,500
opening this great setup sessions so

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,940
today I will be speaking about iot

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,940
security and just for a reality check

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,039
how many of you have to deal with iot

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,520
security raise your hands

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,160
all right so that means that this

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,599
session is going to be useful for the

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,460
majority of you because it gives like an

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,460
overview on what iot security is what

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,500
what have been the changes in the last

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,059
10 plus years

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,760
and I want to start with a little

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,920
introduction about myself and and my job

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,260
and why basically you should be spending

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,879
40 minutes of your life listening to

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,680
what I have to say and what you can gain

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,340
out of this session

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,739
I I was raised and born in Italy in the

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,440
south of Italy actually where I took my

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,079
master in computer engineering I moved

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,399
in Finland first in the Netherlands

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,580
later you might wonder One why someone

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,220
decides to move to the Netherlands or to

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,260
Finland once that is born in the south

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,700
of Italy but that's another discussion

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,380
we can have it over here

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,920
I I did my PhD in uh in the Netherlands

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,080
it was actually in privacy and intuition

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,040
detection

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,619
and after that I started to work with a

35
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:23,880
company which was called security

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,960
matters and was the first company doing

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,460
OT security

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,860
so that means I have more than 10 years

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,520
of experience in OT and iot security and

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
how things have changed

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,540
nowadays after after a few years

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,100
actually security matters which was a

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,380
startup was bought by forescout which is

44
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,560
one of the sponsors also here and and

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
since then I am leading the research

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,240
team at fourscout it's called Vedder

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,299
labs in Italian but also if you speak

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,220
Portuguese might make sense to humans to

49
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,460
see to understand to analyze and the

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,860
mission of our team is actually to look

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,140
at the threat landscape especially

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,639
looking at iot but not only we do stuff

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,860
like network monitoring intuition

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,160
detection we do threat research malware

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,239
analysis threat intelligence so yeah I

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,760
hope I can provide some of share some of

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,020
my knowledge with you guys and that you

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,000
can find that useful

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,340
so what do we do over their lab so I

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,540
think it's quite interesting because it

61
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,340
gives you an idea of what security

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,379
researcher teams are actually doing all

63
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,680
day long so in our case what we have and

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,319
we are quite lucky because we have a set

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,519
of data that is coming to to our clouds

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,519
daily and this data that we collect in

67
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,200
more than 3000 sites that we are

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,120
monitoring and this data about devices

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
so whenever we have these sensing

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
capabilities from forescout We're

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,140
actually looking at what devices are in

72
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,200
a network you know is microphone

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,480
connected to the network laptop servers

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,420
whatever is there and we capture a lot

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,239
of attributes out of this of these

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,519
devices what firmware operative system

77
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,019
are they running what port what

78
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,060
protocols all of this information comes

79
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,720
up to our um to our cloud and then what

80
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,340
we do is actually reaching this

81
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
information let's say this gives us an

82
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,120
information about what's out there so

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,379
it's not really the threat landscape

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,659
it's more like okay what what what are

85
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,640
what are we deploying as a society what

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,739
is what are the devices that actually

87
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,159
creating and composing our our society

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,560
our infrastructure then what we do is we

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,700
integrate

90
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
this information with information which

91
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,319
is a little bit more threat related so

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,019
we look at the Deep Web we look at we

93
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,400
have a set of honeypots actually

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,860
deployed Geo in different geographies

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,260
that are simulating a variety of devices

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,000
and trying to understand what kind of

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,159
techniques what type of kind of things

98
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,379
are they looking for The Trackers are

99
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,659
doing against those devices and what are

100
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,000
the devices that are more sexy from a

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,180
Tracker that are more after two and then

102
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,940
we also put the we have together like

103
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,860
put together a Sandbox where we actually

104
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,599
analyze the malware how is the malware

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,220
evolving what kind of things are

106
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,200
happening what are the ttps that we can

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,579
track Etc and then what we do in this um

108
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,620
in In This Cloud what the data Labs team

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,899
does is putting these things together so

110
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,000
we do data enrichment we do aggregation

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,699
correlation and we are able to say you

112
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,860
know this is the trends that we see we

113
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,560
see that more threat actors are actually

114
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,320
looking after VoIP phones and they try

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
if you have avoid forms that actually

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,620
try what are they trying to attack and

117
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,000
why is that happening and what are the

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
bad IPS where are they coming from are

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,639
they Associated to certain

120
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,960
infrastructure that is actually

121
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
associated with a certain protector so

122
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,560
all of these additional information

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
reaching of the information is happening

124
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,740
and then what we do as our team is both

125
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
giving back this information this threat

126
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,060
intelligence to our products

127
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,440
um so that you know the customer that

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,880
have this can actually be more up to

129
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,979
date with the landscape but at the same

130
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,720
time you're actually having a big big

131
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,940
mission around sharing it with the

132
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,100
community so we are part we are

133
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,620
basically all this information which can

134
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,720
be in a form of a report you can be in a

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,020
form of a more actionable threat feed is

136
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,400
actually shared with a variety of

137
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,220
stakeholders which include isats isats

138
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,100
are like the centers that are sharing

139
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,720
information for instance that is

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,060
Healthcare Isaacs where like all the

141
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,880
members are hospitals or manufacturing

142
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,419
for medical devices We join stuff like

143
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,340
actually EDP is part of the ISAC which

144
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,740
is the energy Isaac is where like energy

145
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,780
providers across Europe are actually

146
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,419
joining and they are saying oh I've been

147
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,100
attacked by this kind of threat actors

148
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,900
by this IP and shares that information

149
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,060
security in a trusted network with

150
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,820
others peers like with other utilities

151
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,160
owner or with the with the researchers

152
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,979
and and and research institution or we

153
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,600
collaborate with the CSUN which is you

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,060
know the cyber security agency of us and

155
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,919
there are a variety of other agencies in

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,539
uh in different countries that are

157
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,620
actually looking at cyber security

158
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,660
issues we share this information with

159
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,840
them sometimes the FBI or sisa asks us

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
do you know anything about this IP have

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,940
you seen it active since when you have

162
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,860
seen active what kind of ttps is using

163
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,479
so we are basically joining the

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,900
community in in this effort

165
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,639
actually most of the things I will be

166
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,500
talking about today is done by my team

167
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,600
the team is not huge but is highly

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,639
skilled and a couple of things I wanted

169
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,860
to share again like I think one of the

170
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,680
mission like and when we were speaking

171
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,319
um with Jorge is like oh don't try but

172
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,419
if you can be inspirational so one of

173
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
the things I would like to do is also

174
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,460
share with you what threat research team

175
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,740
can do who they are and what kind of

176
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,419
skill sets they have in these cases it's

177
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,360
a quite diverse team also in terms of

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
language in terms of skill sets some of

179
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,620
them have a PhD actually most of them

180
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,440
and even in languages if you're doing

181
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,539
threat research having a team that can

182
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,979
speak a lot of languages is actually

183
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,080
quite useful and you need that because

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
for instance to understand the comments

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,560
in the code when you are doing reverse

186
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,300
engineering if you speak Russian it can

187
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,560
be quite useful if you speak Chinese

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,900
even more so like those kind of things

189
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,000
actually have like it's like things

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,740
maybe you don't think at the beginning

191
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,360
when you're hiring someone but it's

192
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,280
definitely useful and also we have a

193
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,440
broad skill set which allow us to to do

194
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,819
all the kind of use cases I mentioned

195
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,800
before right you need machine learning

196
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
but you're not focusing on your machine

197
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,979
learning you also do need to do some

198
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,020
detection some malware analysis and you

199
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,960
need to learn how to to change those

200
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,060
skill set and to adapt

201
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,759
something else that we do is actually

202
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,000
building Labs physically building labs

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,039
and I think this is actually something

204
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,080
that is incredibly useful if you are in

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,840
iot and it is useful because sometimes

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,479
when you speak about you know iot is

207
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,280
building automation control iot is

208
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,199
HVAC heating and ventilation controller

209
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,060
what it really is what is the device

210
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,919
that are actually controlling the HVAC

211
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,780
so what we do we also have an internship

212
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,759
program and we have students coming with

213
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,979
us but also like me myself I've been

214
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,599
built part of that lab actually the

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,880
house was my dollhouse and and the

216
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,740
reason why we wanted to do that is

217
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,080
because if you if you need to buy to

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,840
deploy and to make the system work you

219
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,300
really understand much better what is

220
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
the real problem like some of those

221
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,979
devices when you deploy them are very

222
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,599
difficult to deploy so the challenge is

223
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,419
like okay I have a PhD and I'm having

224
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,339
trouble troubles understanding how to

225
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,700
deploy this device so when deploying

226
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,399
this is is maybe some you know

227
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,458
um they do it like thousands of times

228
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,080
but in the way at the beginning the the

229
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,760
device is actually complex they need to

230
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,440
understand they will find some Shortcut

231
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,540
and you know what is the result of a

232
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,920
shortcut when you're doing an

233
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
installation of those kind of systems

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,060
security weaknesses so you really need

235
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,440
to understand the problem from from the

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
beginning so this lab that we see here

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,399
we have it actually in Eindhoven it can

238
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,080
be visited and it's quite interesting

239
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,440
because it shows like really what do you

240
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,420
see behind the doors of the control room

241
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,640
behind the doors of

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,839
um and the control Blue Room is

243
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,880
everywhere it's in a hospital is in the

244
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,100
government is in an airport is in

245
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,720
critical infrastructure and most of the

246
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
devices have common the devices that are

247
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
there so today I will discuss what these

248
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
devices are and why are they different

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,899
from the standard way we do security for

250
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,420
web application web servers or I.T

251
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,339
systems because there are quite some

252
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,640
differences and some of them are huge

253
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
now enough with the little introduction

254
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,019
let's get started

255
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,680
I will start with definitions oops here

256
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,080
and I promise is this is the slide which

257
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,600
that contains most of the text most of

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
the others are going to be easier to

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,920
digest but more than focusing on really

260
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
the definition what is iot what I want

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
to discuss with you is how difficult it

262
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
is to Define iot if you go online and

263
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,880
you try to say okay what is iot Internet

264
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,399
of Things what are the things and and

265
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,360
with with ears actually the terms I've

266
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,980
emerged new terms that actually

267
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,200
specialized iot

268
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,560
OT IMT ioe so let's let's give a little

269
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,300
bit like stop a second and what I was

270
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,860
speaking about so when we speak about

271
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,260
IIT is general information technology

272
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,959
standard systems standard system is like

273
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,940
things that most of us like everybody

274
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,120
has to deal with things like phones

275
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
things like laptops servers computers

276
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
networks and and that's like

277
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
until 20 years ago it was mostly all the

278
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
kind of devices you had to worry about

279
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,600
but in the few last decades things have

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,459
changed first of all there is something

281
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,100
quite important which is called OT and

282
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,320
stands for operational technology and is

283
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,660
really like the technology that allows

284
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,079
you to do controls of processes so if

285
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,240
you think about manufacturing if you

286
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,120
think about the control of a hardware if

287
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,940
you think about the belt for the luggage

288
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,220
system in an airport those are typically

289
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,200
controlled by OT system

290
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
OT system include things like PLC and

291
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,339
you have heard about programmable logic

292
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,740
controllers and then communicate with

293
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,480
scada that have specific Network

294
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,839
specific protocols and those are

295
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,000
sometimes I say that OT stands for old

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,579
technology because they're very old and

297
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,220
Legacy systems that sometimes rely on

298
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,420
yeah Windows XP Windows Vista

299
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,019
and then iot came was born and it was

300
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,620
mostly to Define what is what what are

301
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,180
the things that are communicating over

302
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,500
the internet I think that this

303
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,579
definition is actually not really

304
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,920
correct because most of the times they

305
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,660
don't communicate over the Internet they

306
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,160
actually communicate over their Network

307
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,860
which can be a land can be connected and

308
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,860
secured and controlled and things

309
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,880
typically means sensor actuators so a

310
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,160
sensor like for a light bulb or a sensor

311
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,300
for

312
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,640
um I don't know for the temperature in

313
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,740
this room but actually there is also a

314
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,440
huge difference between iot iot is

315
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,320
fragmented iot for Enterprise which is

316
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,079
typically called I iot so the internet

317
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,079
of industrial things include stuff that

318
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,779
are more for organization so I become

319
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,240
cameras

320
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,399
HVAC system access control with the

321
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,079
badge Etc but there is also a huge part

322
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,180
of the iot which is the consumer iot you

323
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,360
know your doorbell your Alexa

324
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,640
your Philips Hue Lights that you have at

325
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
home and those are very very different

326
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,720
Technologies very different vendors a

327
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,360
lot of different operating systems then

328
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,100
you have the internet of medical things

329
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,959
where the things in that case are

330
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,700
medical medical devices like MRI and and

331
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,440
infusion pumps and smart watches and

332
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,240
whatever and then there is a new term

333
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,100
which has been emerged in the latest

334
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,200
years which is the internet of

335
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,639
everything it's like really actually

336
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,820
everything is connected so if there is

337
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,519
something that really is common to all

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,600
of those

339
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,820
is connectivity

340
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,220
all of those devices what really mean

341
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,660
makes the eye of something IO X is the

342
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,700
fact that they communicate and the fact

343
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,920
that the diversity of devices that is

344
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,380
communicating is introducing a variety

345
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,720
of issues and security challenges that

346
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,579
we are going to speak about today

347
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,519
so as I mentioned already definition of

348
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,500
fuzzy so if you look at actually the

349
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,560
kind of devices that are in it or t iiot

350
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,740
iot per se and IMT there is a lot of

351
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,019
overlap like for instance if you have

352
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,060
something like you know a smartwatch is

353
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,519
that ioter is medical iomp because it's

354
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,500
actually a medical application so what

355
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,860
we are going to do today is is I will

356
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,540
use the word iot

357
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,440
to speak about most of these things but

358
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,360
excluding the I.T part of it

359
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
and I want to give you also an idea of

360
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,940
why the connectivity is important and

361
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,100
and with the use case which I find quite

362
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,760
interesting so I think with Amazon if we

363
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
take Amazon as an example most of the

364
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,240
things that we are speaking about today

365
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,260
are connected so Amazon has Selling

366
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,260
Stuff Selling Stuff uh by basically

367
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,600
shipping products across the globe to

368
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,779
ship it uses drones and it actually also

369
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,459
produces some of these things so it does

370
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,680
manufacturing it has iot where there are

371
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,839
a lot of sensors that are monitoring the

372
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,980
manufacturing I don't know if you ever

373
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,300
seen online there is a nice YouTube

374
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,180
video that shows how the drones and how

375
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,420
actually the the storage of Amazon are

376
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,399
are controlled that is a loading system

377
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,779
but but Amazon is also selling

378
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,180
Alexa and a lot of iot devices and at

379
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,579
the same time is controlling all of that

380
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,100
all the information that comes from

381
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,920
whatever whatever things you are buying

382
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,079
on Amazon on their data center so it's

383
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,699
really like the picture I showed before

384
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,399
like all those different devices in

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,380
organization like Amazon or alike and

386
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,519
there are a lot of other examples where

387
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,740
you can see everything is starting to

388
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,079
get connected and when things are

389
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,420
getting connected is well if you don't

390
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,000
do it properly some of the some of the

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
issues can arise so again as I mentioned

392
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,060
today's Focus I will call it iot

393
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,940
I will not mention any more OT ermt blah

394
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,959
blah because I think it's just more

395
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,420
complex I'll call iot but I mean a

396
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,420
plethora of things so do not

397
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,860
um do not come back to me and say oh but

398
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,680
this is not iot after work so a couple

399
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,300
of things about iot

400
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,279
iot is diverse

401
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,279
one of the first challenges about it is

402
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,920
the amount of operating system that you

403
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,839
can see of all those devices that I

404
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,600
mentioned so at first Scout I mentioned

405
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,279
before right we are collecting a variety

406
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,160
of data we are tracking more than 2 000

407
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,260
different version of operating system

408
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,320
you know what it means

409
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,940
that you cannot have an antivirus

410
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,740
because otherwise you need to support

411
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,820
2000 and more versions of that antivirus

412
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,740
so the fact that there is this diversity

413
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,620
as some security implication so

414
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,620
patches are very difficult to develop

415
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,019
because if you have a lot of variety a

416
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,940
lot of diversity and there is like one

417
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,060
one system that is impacted is complex

418
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,579
and is expensive so imagine that you are

419
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,260
actually in the security team of a

420
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,899
company or an organization and this

421
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,420
organization has iot and first of all

422
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,980
they will not know what iot they have in

423
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,720
their Network that one of that's one of

424
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,180
the first challenges but even even if

425
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,940
they do understanding what

426
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,040
software is running on the devices if

427
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
it's vulnerable and if the patch is

428
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,300
available is really complicated variety

429
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,699
system in Contra position if you have a

430
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,040
Windows or another like a Linux server

431
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,440
is like one command and then you get the

432
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
patch done and installed and with one

433
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,980
command actually you can install it and

434
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,899
deploy it in all your thousand servers

435
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,639
that you have in the organization so

436
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,440
like really the level of complexity is

437
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,180
incredibly different

438
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,480
also a problem is that those devices are

439
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,119
unagentable and unmanaged indeed like

440
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,459
another synonymous that is often being

441
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,760
used lately for for iot is unmanaged

442
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,400
device what unmanaged means and manage

443
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,199
means that you cannot have an agent

444
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,720
easily for some of them you will but in

445
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,540
in in the large majority you cannot have

446
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,859
an agent meaning you cannot have

447
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,780
software running on those

448
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,480
devices that you can use to control

449
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
those devices there are some companies

450
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,380
that are trying starting to do some

451
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,740
agents for iot but you know like given

452
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,140
the variety of the diversity it's really

453
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,880
a difficult a challenging things you can

454
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,860
do it and you can fix it forever for

455
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,500
like a small set of devices vendor and

456
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,740
model but doing it like to cover the

457
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,900
scale of diversity of those devices is

458
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,740
quite complicated and so typically I

459
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,880
don't know if you have followed the

460
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
solar wind case do you know about solar

461
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,179
wind

462
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,120
well solar wind is a um is a software

463
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,299
that is used to to manage I.T systems

464
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,860
there is not an equivalent of solar wind

465
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,919
variety system when solar wind uh when

466
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,780
you are solar wind you can say okay if

467
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,520
you are not running the latest version

468
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,160
of Windows or if you're your antivirus

469
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,500
is disabled you are not compliant I

470
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,820
don't trust you anymore into my network

471
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,400
and I kick you out of the network

472
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,500
you cannot do the same for iot devices

473
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,260
so it's really difficult to trust iot

474
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,600
devices to understand where they are and

475
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
to to apply changes remotely or to even

476
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,340
give like some compliance Rule and that

477
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,660
is the zero trust initiative where

478
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,860
basically you need to comply with the

479
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,480
certain policies before entering the

480
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,039
networks it's very complicated to do

481
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,860
that with iot devices

482
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,380
and another thing about ioc iot is that

483
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,720
it is really everywhere so these are

484
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,280
some of the data that come from the

485
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,900
cloud I mentioned in the beginning so

486
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,660
from the forescout data Lake

487
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,419
and we track a variety of Industry we

488
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,340
have 300 3000 more than three thousand

489
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,160
sites across the globe in financial

490
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,740
Healthcare utilities retail government

491
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,620
and Manufacturing and if you look those

492
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,299
are the iot the differences of iot

493
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,780
devices that you find in those organic

494
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,419
kind of organization so stuff like IP

495
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,580
phones for me this was like amazing it's

496
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,480
like really they are so common

497
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,799
Vibe phones are everywhere like

498
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
especially in hospitals and Healthcare

499
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,000
is like every office has one and and in

500
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,280
government there is stuff like patient

501
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,480
monitor which is there and is also

502
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,919
connected to a variety of other devices

503
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,380
and we as we will discuss why this

504
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,059
becomes a problem

505
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,520
um UPS's in operational technology which

506
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
are like the one for the devices to to

507
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,679
deal uh with the energy drops are also

508
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,500
very common IP cameras are also very

509
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,900
common iot devices but like the message

510
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,460
is

511
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,760
really there is no reason why someone

512
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,160
that is in a cyber security should

513
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,320
ignore the problem of iot because it's

514
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,760
everywhere you eventually will have to

515
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,440
deal with it

516
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,799
but why why are we speaking about

517
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,660
cyber security variety right it means

518
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,580
that there is some attack

519
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,799
landscape there is a threat landscape so

520
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,039
why would people attack iot

521
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,080
um there are a variety of reasons I try

522
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,059
to summarize some of them but if you

523
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,320
look at OT and I am iomt so the medical

524
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,660
part their legacy systems they are very

525
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,520
old they are investment even in building

526
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,500
automation there are investment I think

527
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,539
in building automation the the statistic

528
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,820
was that 60 of building automation

529
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,820
system are at least 20 years old

530
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,880
and we call them smart buildings when

531
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,140
you go and you look at smart building

532
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,760
they are far away from being smart they

533
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,919
are old devices where you put

534
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,600
connectivity on top of that and that's

535
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,520
the recipe for disaster because it's

536
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,919
like technology that was designed with

537
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,380
insecurity by Design I mean the vendors

538
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,559
even use the term because it's like what

539
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,900
is necessary to have there is

540
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
reliability and availability there is

541
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,539
nothing no need for confidentiality to

542
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,280
be kept so there is no encryption no

543
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,480
Authentication

544
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,299
a funny story a bit of aggression so 10

545
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,880
years ago when I started and and staxnet

546
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,100
with a thing and we will see what Saxon

547
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,320
is but when the first attacks were they

548
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,900
happened uh I think everybody in the

549
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,640
industry was like okay no authentication

550
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,100
okay no no

551
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,840
um encryption we understand there was

552
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,900
the no the seasons are like they are

553
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,220
resource constrained you cannot really

554
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,840
apply encryption because the latency is

555
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,760
too high and blah blah blah blah we did

556
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,340
it we did a test well we did a research

557
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,280
now 12 years after saksnet about the

558
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,500
security level of those devices 10 years

559
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,600
after and I don't know how many attacks

560
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
after we will see like how many and the

561
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,740
situation is still the same still

562
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,179
nowadays if you buy a PLC for your brand

563
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,640
new manufacturing plant you will still

564
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
have those programs and this is

565
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,640
something that this is the society and

566
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,760
the community should not accept anymore

567
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,100
um on the contrary

568
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,419
iot is new diverse different and nobody

569
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,760
really knows what is running into an iot

570
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
device what operating system what TCP

571
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,020
stack what's that like and then it is

572
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,700
the supply chain

573
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,240
um issue which will also discuss and is

574
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,480
is a known it is not tracked by IIT

575
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,299
system so it's really a risk for

576
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,299
um for organization and on top of that

577
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,280
what you have is that everything is

578
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,320
converging right the example of Amazon

579
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,620
there are use cases in which you need

580
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,860
your manufacturing plant to communicate

581
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,720
with your data center because you want

582
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,760
to track what you are producing so that

583
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,340
you can maybe order in a order in

584
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,780
advance all the material that you need

585
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
to actually produce that product so the

586
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,940
use cases are emerging for the need of

587
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,960
connection

588
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,059
but the devices that are the underlining

589
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,820
devices that are creating the networks

590
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,600
where we rely on are intrinsically

591
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,760
challenging that and and with some

592
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,380
security problems

593
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,400
now let's give a look back uh how how

594
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,260
the threat landscape evolved what kind

595
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,000
of attacks do we really see to the to

596
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,919
the iot uh one of the questions

597
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,059
sometimes when we speak with

598
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,820
stakeholders like is why should I care

599
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,600
about iot the attackers are actually

600
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,980
attacking I.T system they are after

601
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,440
ransomware is after is after my I.T

602
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,320
system it's after my laptop servers uh

603
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,780
why should I get also about iot so

604
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,220
actually there has been quite an

605
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,880
interesting evolution of

606
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,640
um of the motivation of attacks the kind

607
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,919
of attacks that we see into the iot

608
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,020
world and I want to discuss this with

609
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,039
you

610
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,380
um so everything actually started in

611
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,700
2010 when stats net which is by far the

612
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,679
most

613
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,299
complex

614
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,260
cyber War ever built was used

615
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,539
to actually effectively having an impact

616
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,840
on physical system so sometimes when you

617
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,480
speak about iot and you speak about

618
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,220
attacks to iot you need to understand

619
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,440
that in the I.T world what you are

620
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,159
damaging is data so if you have a Dos

621
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,980
you have unavailability of data if you

622
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,720
have a data leakage you have over

623
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
sharing of data if you have a ransomware

624
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,659
is also an availability of data but in

625
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,280
the OT world

626
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,159
the impact is physical if I'm destroying

627
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,100
if I am blocking the production

628
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,059
of of a production line or in this case

629
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,980
of sex net what was done basically with

630
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,120
the malware was increasingly sorry

631
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,820
slowly increasing the the speed of the

632
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,159
router for the nuclear process

633
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,659
so when it became too high actually

634
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,000
there was an explosion and this is

635
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,760
believed to have been delayed the

636
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,000
nuclear plan for Iran for more than two

637
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,580
years and if you go and you look at you

638
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,980
know I love the name the threat actor is

639
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,200
called Gossip Girl Doing threat

640
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
attribution is also quite complicated

641
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,679
right every time I'm gonna say threat

642
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,080
attribution is highly likely that is

643
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,400
that that's what the community is

644
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,799
converging to you're never never sure

645
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,360
that that's actually the threat actor

646
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,240
but it is believed that his organization

647
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,700
that come that came together also it was

648
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,460
very costly to to develop stats net and

649
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,779
it will it is believed that where

650
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,059
organization affiliated with the US and

651
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,179
the Israeli government and this software

652
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,760
was highly sophisticated and highly

653
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,820
targeted it was really targeted to a PLC

654
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,220
in the plan of a very specific model

655
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,919
which was a Siemens PLC that they knew

656
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,559
was in uh used in the plant in in Iran

657
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,779
the next attack which was big when we

658
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,220
made the news these are like there have

659
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,960
been also other and I can give you

660
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,940
reference for actually giving a look at

661
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,279
every attacks that happened from 2010 to

662
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,400
2022 but the next one word of attention

663
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,159
is is industrial industrial one because

664
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,380
recently there is Industries too uh

665
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,260
which is also called crash override in

666
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,740
this case the target was Ukraine and it

667
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,440
was in the capital in Kiev to actually

668
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,480
attack a substation for the energy

669
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
distribution so that it was able to

670
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,400
cause a blackout of some hours in some

671
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,159
of the region of of Kiev

672
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,159
um in this case the threat actor that is

673
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,460
attributed to this attack was

674
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,440
sandworm which is half affiliated with

675
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,659
the Russian government and the the

676
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,279
difference from a technical perspective

677
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,380
is that the sophistication of this

678
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,559
malware was less destruction so like

679
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,779
they're going to do like a malware is

680
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,640
becoming less and less complex

681
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,100
it was multi-stage so you have initial

682
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,340
access lateral movement and eventually

683
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,799
hit the the PLC that is actually running

684
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,720
the substation and it was automated

685
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,000
almost fully

686
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
in 2017 something else that's really

687
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,880
scared the community was threatened of

688
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,539
Crisis and it was different because in

689
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,020
this time they were attacking the safety

690
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,960
instrumentation system so every control

691
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,640
system especially if it's for the oil

692
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,400
refinery energy distribution or you know

693
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,679
heavy industrial process they have

694
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,480
Safety Systems so that if something

695
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,059
fails they stop so that human lives can

696
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,260
actually be saved right if you're

697
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,940
working on the plant you need to have

698
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,120
some some safety uh is the you hope that

699
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,919
those systems never

700
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,799
um never switch on but they are there so

701
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,960
what happened is that the actor also in

702
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,980
this case Russian government Associated

703
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,320
hit in Saudi Arabia one of the

704
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
petrochemical companies actually the

705
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,260
particular Chemical Company to actually

706
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,159
um

707
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,400
targeting the safety instrumental system

708
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,820
which kicked in was stopped and no no

709
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,220
many details emerged actually on what

710
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,380
the impact was but for sure there were

711
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,419
some stops to the production and the

712
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,760
attack was successful in the sense that

713
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,400
it arrived where it had to also in this

714
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,320
case it was highly targeted and this one

715
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,059
was highly complex

716
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,740
this year though

717
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,700
when the war started in Ukraine we all

718
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,500
saw everybody in the industry was

719
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,799
expecting a lot of cyber work we were

720
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,020
expecting attacks to come and to hit the

721
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,940
critical infrastructure of Ukraine and

722
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,559
so there was after the after a month or

723
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,419
two everybody was a bit surprised it's

724
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,400
like why it didn't happen at the scale

725
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,740
that everybody was predicting and

726
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,720
industry was an attempt but actually it

727
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,940
was a failed attempt

728
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,620
um if you look at the code of industrial

729
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,460
too is an evolution of industryer one

730
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,559
but is uh it looks like a proof of

731
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,240
concept it looks like something was

732
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,000
wrong uh it's like maybe it was deployed

733
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,860
too early so that's the like the

734
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,900
community sort of like converging to

735
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,360
that idea and was also the target was

736
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,919
Ukraine actually different critical

737
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,860
infrastructures around Ukraine and when

738
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,380
the communication in the energy sector

739
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,140
let's say if you want to control the

740
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,880
substation for the energy distribution

741
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,919
it depends on a protocol which is called

742
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,320
ISE 104 which is typically used for

743
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
energy and only for energy and that was

744
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,980
the kind of protocol that was like the

745
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,960
payload of that protocol was tweaked in

746
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,640
this attack so that's how you understand

747
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,559
you know they are after the energy

748
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,240
sector another financial sector because

749
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,860
you will not find this protocol in the

750
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,720
financial sector

751
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,000
um the sophistication also was low looks

752
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,860
like a proof of concept and it was a

753
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,059
little bit less targeted because he

754
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,919
wanted to be more mainstream in wanted

755
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,919
to attack all kind of energy utilities

756
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,600
that he could whatever he could

757
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,460
which brings us again to 2022 where we

758
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,600
are seeing ransomware spilling to

759
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,760
operational technology or to it so

760
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,399
ransomware the primary that like Target

761
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,880
of ransomware at the moment is an I.T

762
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,340
system so that they are able to encrypt

763
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,340
it and push push the companies to pay

764
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,700
for the ransom what we are seeing is

765
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,760
actually that a lot of those of those

766
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,820
ransomware are able to reach

767
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,820
the OT for the operational technology or

768
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,179
the I.T and then they can encrypt those

769
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,059
and you know has a sort of byproduct as

770
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,799
a collateral damage they can actually

771
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,600
stop the production have you heard about

772
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,240
the colonial pipeline case

773
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,120
well basically there was uh it was one

774
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,700
of the ransomware which was hitting the

775
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,740
I.T part but it was almost propagating

776
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,779
so what the the colonial pipeline

777
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,700
decided to do which was the victim

778
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,620
was to stop the operational technology

779
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,820
so there were I don't know if you saw

780
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,220
the images of kilometers kilometers and

781
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,760
kilometers of queue to get oil in U.S in

782
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,919
in the in the west coast on this course

783
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,559
but anyway it was it was an impact so

784
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,419
it's like okay ransomware is not really

785
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,279
only ID it's actually coming an

786
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,899
organization if you're an organization

787
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:03,120
that actually have planned or energy

788
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,940
distribution or anything to do with

789
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,399
physical process you need to also worry

790
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,460
about ransomware hitting your production

791
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,799
and if your production is down on top of

792
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,779
the ransomware that you are paying you

793
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,399
also need to pay the cost for the

794
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,320
production being down so those are kind

795
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,700
of risks that you need to take into

796
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,960
account

797
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,500
now this is the history of what happened

798
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,779
what's happening now

799
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,760
well there are some

800
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,980
trends that I want to discuss with you

801
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,620
and then come to some conclusion some of

802
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,899
the trends that we have on top of what

803
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,880
we have been saying so far iot is

804
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,980
diverse a lot of operating system there

805
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,840
is another issue which is the supply

806
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,240
chain issue which is not only for iot

807
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,700
but for iot is quite heavy so we did a

808
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,799
research in in vedera Labs it's called

809
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,659
project Memorial in Project Memorial

810
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,200
what we did was to analyze the tcpip

811
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,100
stacks for we analyze 14 TCP stack the

812
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,960
tcpip stack is the software component

813
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,320
that is actually used to create TCP

814
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
communication between devices so every

815
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,419
Network device has a TCP stack we took

816
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,039
them some of them open source some of

817
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,899
them private with reverse engineered we

818
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,480
found it we find we found over

819
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,760
90 vulnerabilities in seven of the 14

820
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,159
of the 14 stacks and then like you have

821
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,260
so we are researchers security

822
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,539
researcher vulnerability researchers we

823
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,640
we are located we are sitting on top of

824
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,220
98 vulnerabilities what do we do we

825
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,380
contact sisa and it's like oh we have

826
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,840
9820 release what do we do and they're

827
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,940
like who is impacted

828
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,100
it's like we don't know

829
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,380
we have no idea who is impacted nobody's

830
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,240
telling you an IP camera is not telling

831
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,880
you if he's running a certain IP TCP

832
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,980
stack the same for an infusion pumps

833
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,740
they don't so what we like it took us

834
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,440
more than 18 months to do the whole

835
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,779
project from start to over most of it

836
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,520
was actually over the responsible

837
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,020
disclosure because we were trying to

838
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,419
identify the impacted vendors so that we

839
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,220
could for some of them we found

840
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,860
documentation so we found the PDF of an

841
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,380
IP camera and was saying uh for whatever

842
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,440
reason a certain TCP was named there so

843
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,240
it's like oh we believe you might be

844
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,580
running this TCP seek that by the way is

845
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,860
vulnerable to a lot of vulnerabilities

846
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,799
and so that's the supply chain problem

847
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,200
is like when you have vulnerability in a

848
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,960
in a component which and with the TCP

849
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,940
stack was very interesting because that

850
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,700
component is then used in motherboard or

851
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,240
network cards then then are used into a

852
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,460
final device so the same motherboard can

853
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,140
be used by Nappy camera and avoid phone

854
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,240
but really try hacking that is very

855
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,220
complicated so and more and more

856
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,140
researchers and also attackers are

857
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,580
actually focusing on those kind of

858
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,019
vulnerabilities you can see similar

859
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,519
things in you know the solar wind case

860
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,080
and another case

861
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,120
and then there is the insecurity by

862
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,100
design that is specifically

863
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,840
for iot

864
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,039
um where

865
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,820
iot is developed still unfortunately by

866
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,059
not having Security in mind and that's a

867
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,580
mindset that needs to to be defeated

868
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,139
um other strands are the fact that

869
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,899
actually iot is increasing in number so

870
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,580
if you see here this graph is also

871
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,500
coming from from the sensors that we

872
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,179
have

873
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,199
OT iot and IMT together they form almost

874
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,540
more than 40 percent of the devices that

875
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,219
we see in average in organizations

876
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,540
that's a lot

877
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,359
so it's something like the iot should be

878
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,719
on the agenda of of the the security

879
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,820
team

880
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,500
the popular iot devices are especially

881
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,940
surveillance so and IP camera

882
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,800
communication Network physical security

883
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,480
and the plethora of all the other

884
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,239
devices I showed in the other slide

885
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
and what's happening from an attack

886
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,300
perspective

887
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,339
is that people are starting the threat

888
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,619
actors are starting looking at iot so

889
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,260
iot is being actively used either as an

890
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,599
entry point in several cases or as uh

891
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,040
elements for the bottleneck in the Mirai

892
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,140
case so Mirai was actually able to to

893
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,560
get more than two millions devices on on

894
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,839
one of the largest button botnet ever

895
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,720
observed or there was a case in a casino

896
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,020
in U.S the fish tank sensor for actually

897
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,359
the temperature was used at an entry

898
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,920
level to actually do the attack to the

899
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,380
IC System and doing data infiltration

900
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,099
even there was a big case in

901
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,359
Tesco where something similar happened

902
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,000
and they were able to enter from the

903
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,480
posts which is the payment system so iot

904
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,000
can actually be also an entry point for

905
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,579
for more serious attacks

906
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,680
and another trend

907
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,079
and you you will see why I'm putting

908
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,780
this here is the data actually attackers

909
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,339
one money

910
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,619
it might be simple but like for a lot of

911
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,300
for many years

912
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,940
the reason why cyber security for iot

913
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,540
was dismissed is because oh this is

914
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,579
national state right if you saw the five

915
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,820
initial threatsets I I discussed the

916
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,380
threat actor was actually national state

917
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,180
so it's like you know only a few

918
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,680
organizations are going to be targeted

919
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,180
only highly targeted this is not a

920
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,920
problem for the mainstream but we are

921
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,140
seeing that ransomware which is the most

922
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,880
mainstream

923
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,520
um attacks that we're seeing nowadays is

924
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,099
actually very present and the reason why

925
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,480
is because actually

926
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,940
threat actors are trying to understand

927
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,540
the best way to make the most amount of

928
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,020
money in the fastest way so that's

929
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,180
actually why ransomware is so popular

930
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,420
ransomware has been named the threat of

931
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,540
the year for 2020 2021 and I'm sure it's

932
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,760
going to be also for 2022. there is

933
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
there are plenty of ganks that are

934
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,440
deploying ransomware and a lot of money

935
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,160
that is involved and I want to discuss a

936
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,520
bit with you what how ransomware and iot

937
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,160
can actually meet

938
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,579
and to do so let's start with

939
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,720
some some

940
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
um some understanding of how ransomware

941
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,680
has evolved so

942
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,079
people think is there is a misconception

943
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,060
that actually ransomware is about

944
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,040
encryption so it's like if you stop the

945
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,540
encryption you will stop the run

946
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,760
somewhere but actually ransomware is

947
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,540
about

948
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,420
ransom they want money so they want as

949
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,859
much leverage as possible on your

950
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,720
organization to push you to pay the

951
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,240
money that you're asking for so that's

952
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,339
how we see an evolutionary ransomware

953
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:36,060
before was only encrypting the data now

954
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,280
we are speaking and seeing

955
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,820
two-stage three-stage ransomware where

956
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,040
they are first leaking the data and

957
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,540
that's another leverage it's like you

958
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,040
know all these sensitive data the other

959
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,780
organization and you're a healthcare

960
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,359
organization are available online and

961
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,220
they were not well protected so you will

962
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,740
have to deal with the gdpr lows

963
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,599
reputation damage and all the costs

964
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,760
associated to that

965
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,740
um and also they are doing something

966
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,020
that is we predict is going to happen

967
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,960
they can actually use iot OT and

968
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,440
whatever is Meaningful for a process

969
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,119
perspective from physical perspective

970
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,760
for an organization to actually block

971
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,940
that if if the attack actually spills to

972
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,980
the otn to the iot and you don't have

973
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,440
access to the building anymore and or

974
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,140
you do not have extra condition your

975
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,720
production is down those are big pushers

976
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,520
for you as an organization to actually

977
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,200
pay for the ransomware that you've been

978
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,119
asked

979
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,900
So what at this point so we were doing

980
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,359
this analysis last year and then we

981
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,980
started it's like okay but do you really

982
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,119
think that what role the iot can play in

983
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,760
this kind of of landscape so what we did

984
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,760
at Twitter Labs we created

985
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,740
um we we did an hypothesis it's like

986
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,140
okay let's see how feasible it is how

987
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,440
realistic in so again we see we monitor

988
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,940
3000

989
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,800
um sites with all kind of networks

990
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,300
understanding also how these networks

991
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,339
are created it's like is it would really

992
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,900
be possible if I am a Metro attacker

993
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,960
would be possible for me to Target the

994
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,240
um the the

995
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,460
OT part of it or to enter via an iot

996
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,460
device then what we did was okay let's

997
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,380
let's assume that this Advantage is true

998
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,720
so we want to enter Vienna iot we want

999
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,240
to move laterally and try to encrypt I.T

1000
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,220
but then we also want to do the you know

1001
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,980
double explosion and also stop the OT

1002
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,400
system so that the so that you know we

1003
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,079
push more an organization to pay so this

1004
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,500
was all of an exercise about Theory

1005
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,680
and that's actually what we did we we

1006
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,300
have the lab right you saw the lab we

1007
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,339
configure the lab after some

1008
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,079
configuration that we have seen in real

1009
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,280
networks so in real networks by the way

1010
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,140
segmentation is not really there so like

1011
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,320
your IP cameras most of the times are on

1012
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,300
the same network where the servers are

1013
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,720
or on the same network where

1014
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,300
laptops are or HVAC is so segmentation

1015
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,339
is not really a thing it's a

1016
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,359
recommendation something that

1017
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,400
everybody's recommended for but it's not

1018
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,740
really happening so after the initials

1019
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,720
access via the iot we wanted to do some

1020
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,520
lateral movement with some techniques

1021
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,160
that are very common and and then having

1022
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,020
an impact on the operational technology

1023
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,300
so this was the plan

1024
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,859
this is a schema of the of the lab so

1025
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,599
and that's actually how networks

1026
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,700
typically work you have an iot Network

1027
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,099
some some people tell you this is on the

1028
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,859
gas Network it's isolated uh evidence

1029
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,660
shows that it's not always the case and

1030
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,940
where you have your IIT devices in this

1031
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,680
case we only put the camera in the nuts

1032
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,720
then you have your corporate network

1033
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,700
with all your I.T system servers and

1034
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,140
laptops and then you have your

1035
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,760
operational Network which has like you

1036
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,320
know the industrial part of it where you

1037
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,480
have production or if you are a hospital

1038
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,520
is where you have

1039
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,619
um control Access Control badges

1040
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,200
lighting for the robots for for the

1041
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,720
surgery so how the attacker work

1042
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,079
is basically using some exploitation and

1043
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,760
also what we wanted to do is like and

1044
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,320
the security tools that are out there

1045
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,359
are they actually helping with any of

1046
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,400
that can they detect those activities

1047
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,020
can they actually have to stop in the

1048
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,720
attack so we use like some exploitation

1049
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,579
of an IP camera one of the most commonly

1050
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,220
one used and from there once the

1051
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,020
attacker was on the IP camera it was

1052
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,619
scanning for other devices it will find

1053
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,740
some Windows device and then it will use

1054
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,460
something like RDP brute force or other

1055
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,720
other

1056
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,420
attack techniques and by the way I think

1057
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,540
in this case we use RDP credential which

1058
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,520
is the top technique used you will be

1059
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,140
surprised it's like oh really like that

1060
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,320
it's one of the most used technique once

1061
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,339
they were

1062
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,680
on on on the Windows machine they can

1063
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,140
actually do a tunneling back to the

1064
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,640
attacker so that the attacker had the

1065
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,859
control over the network

1066
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,140
um and it could actually connect to the

1067
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,720
command and and connect server in the

1068
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,460
malware we actually also dropped a

1069
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,920
crypto Miner so to do the three three

1070
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
stage stuff so like they were also use

1071
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,119
with crypto mining for a while and then

1072
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,640
after that actually dropping the

1073
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,280
ransomware executing the ransomware and

1074
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,540
from there

1075
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,300
once you are in those like in the

1076
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,859
lateral movement you could actually also

1077
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,040
scan for OT devices and if there are OT

1078
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,079
devices because of the way they are

1079
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,060
configured you can actually put them

1080
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,160
down easily sometimes with only one

1081
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,480
packet and that was like one of the

1082
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,740
results that we had from the project

1083
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,780
Memorial like on the tcpip stack if you

1084
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,820
are running one of the vulnerable TCP

1085
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,700
stack I sent one TCP packet with the

1086
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,099
wrong flag the device is dead and that's

1087
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:44,400
what we did here so I I invite you to

1088
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,079
actually read the full report and watch

1089
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,520
the video you can actually see all the

1090
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,160
impact we implemented everything in in

1091
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,180
the uh in our lab and that is a quite

1092
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,380
interesting video that you can look at

1093
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,380
it and then we we presented it and some

1094
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,480
of the feedback we got is like yeah but

1095
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,640
this is not this is not real that's not

1096
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,980
what's happening then

1097
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,180
the county leakage happened and yeah the

1098
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,280
country league has happened and what

1099
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,359
happened here this is quite an

1100
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,119
interesting story so around the I think

1101
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,740
was February or March around the start

1102
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,339
of the war in Ukraine uh the County gang

1103
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,940
is a ransomware gang which had

1104
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,579
um both Russian and and Ukrainian and

1105
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,440
when the war started there was a split

1106
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
of course there were no there were no

1107
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,839
agreement on who to support what support

1108
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,760
Etc and then eventually the Ukrainian

1109
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,720
side leaked all telegram chat from this

1110
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,319
gang it was like days and days worth of

1111
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:44,760
reading telegram chats are quite

1112
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,140
interesting all the times but in this

1113
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,420
time very especially interesting and we

1114
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,859
were lucky enough because yeah some of

1115
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:50,940
our guys

1116
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,099
is Ukrainian speaks Ukrainian is sat

1117
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,079
down in his room for a week and then

1118
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,359
pull out this report in which we unders

1119
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,099
all the stuff they were speaking about

1120
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,900
it's quite interesting because they were

1121
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,900
speaking about PTO not like it's a big

1122
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,280
gang right two or three hundred people

1123
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,720
they have actually an organizational

1124
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
chart they have the head of a charge

1125
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,500
they make the payment they actually have

1126
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,119
some training and amongst this

1127
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,060
conversation what they were saying is oh

1128
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,160
guys but we should look at iot I mean

1129
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,839
have you seen how many iot devices are

1130
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,760
in this hospital or in this school

1131
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,440
like this would be super easy to just

1132
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,540
enter from there we need to ramp up our

1133
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,099
knowledge base and try to understand how

1134
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,220
to do that so it's like things are

1135
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,619
moving in that direction and why because

1136
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,359
it's easy because a lot of devices are

1137
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,920
there are connected I hope I provided

1138
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,020
you enough information on why that

1139
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,099
should be something we should be

1140
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,200
concerned

1141
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,099
now is this doomsday

1142
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,740
not really I mean there is there are

1143
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,800
some good news one of the the best news

1144
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,480
I think is the fact that these attacks

1145
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,300
are slow sometimes attackers are in your

1146
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,240
network for days before they actually

1147
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,640
unleash all their power so there is the

1148
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,960
time to actually identify and attack

1149
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,720
them if you have a good strategy

1150
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,859
um

1151
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,720
so in this case for instance that it was

1152
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,000
one of our example it took at least five

1153
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,060
days for the ransomware to be dropped

1154
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,099
also there is this new trend of

1155
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,619
ransomware as a service right everything

1156
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,920
has to be easy so what the gangs want

1157
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,280
they want as many script kiddos able to

1158
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,540
actually run the run somewhere and

1159
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,800
Target in different organizations

1160
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,599
because that's the model right they get

1161
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,640
the 70 they give the 30 to the script

1162
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,960
kiddos because they actually give the

1163
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,220
infrastructure to them without the

1164
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,780
infrastructure they cannot work so it's

1165
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,099
also called the ransomware

1166
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,780
infrastructure as a service is a new

1167
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,220
thing that is happening but there are

1168
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,079
actually two good news out of that the

1169
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,880
first one is that to be able to do that

1170
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,800
so if the gangs if the trade actors

1171
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,520
wants to scale up they need to make the

1172
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,300
the bad softer the malware easy easy to

1173
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,099
understand which means easy to develop

1174
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,560
which also means it's C to detect if

1175
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,960
it's scaling it means that the same bad

1176
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,060
piece of software is going to be used

1177
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,640
and used so if we do share intelligence

1178
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,040
if we do share the fingerprint if we

1179
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,660
actually have you know Collective threat

1180
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,339
intelligence platform which are emerging

1181
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:09,900
we can actually do something against

1182
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,060
that

1183
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,280
and and then if you have an organization

1184
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,980
and now you believe you know okay iot

1185
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,200
security should be on my agenda what

1186
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,060
should I do about that well there are

1187
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,800
three main things that you know the

1188
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,900
security the cyber security Community is

1189
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,760
recommending and this visibility

1190
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,220
compliance and segmentation so the

1191
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,500
visibility is necessary to know what iot

1192
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,900
system do you have how many where are

1193
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,640
they how are they connected are they

1194
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,200
connected with your crown Jewelers are

1195
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,819
they isolated you you really believe

1196
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,500
they are on the gas Network so

1197
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,720
understand what's on the network

1198
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,839
profile them there are tools that do

1199
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,359
that there are companies like ours they

1200
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:51,060
do that do compliance put the rules in

1201
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,880
place if you do not comply you know with

1202
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,119
my zero trust initiative or with my

1203
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,599
um rules of company just do not allow

1204
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,359
the devices to be to be on the network

1205
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,300
then you can do segmentation make sure

1206
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,819
that you know devices that should not

1207
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:10,560
communicate with the Internet or with a

1208
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,960
lot of another dmzad they are not

1209
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,940
enforce the segmentation do not do

1210
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,280
segmentation via vlans and of course

1211
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,599
there is the whole

1212
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,700
continuous monitoring threat detection

1213
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,240
and response but the basically the main

1214
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,560
takeaways

1215
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,700
is the iot is bringing great power and

1216
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,380
with great car power comes great

1217
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,359
responsibility so you need to take care

1218
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,740
of that

1219
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,040
um and cyber crime are changing and we

1220
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,839
need to track that and be prepared to

1221
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,220
those changes some of those changes

1222
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,780
might be scary but for some of them we

1223
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,700
can actually get prepared

1224
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,000
um and in order to you know create a

1225
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,740
cyber security strategy you need to be

1226
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,839
aware about these problems and map them

1227
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,900
to your organization and create you know

1228
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,520
the best cyber security strategy that

1229
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,400
you could that you could if you are in a

1230
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,560
cyber security team if you are in a

1231
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,000
cyber security research team you should

1232
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,260
know about these things maybe they are

1233
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,040
also interesting for your day-to-day job

1234
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,099
so I hope this was interesting for you

1235
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,280
guys

1236
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:20,980
[Applause]

1237
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,800
thank you so much thank you so much

1238
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,500
Elisa anyone wants to ask something to

1239
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,980
Elisa

1240
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,280
[Music]

1241
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,480
hey can you hear me yeah brilliant with

1242
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,359
the rise of home working how much do you

1243
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,140
think

1244
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,579
businesses should be worried about

1245
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,180
consumer level iot devices being within

1246
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,520
the network that their laptop might be

1247
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,000
connected to or so on and so forth

1248
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,980
sorry yeah I want to make sure I got it

1249
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,339
how

1250
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,900
um you obviously been talking about iot

1251
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,700
devices connected to

1252
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,579
business networks industrial with

1253
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,700
homeworking you now have consumer iot

1254
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,400
devices connected to the same network as

1255
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,099
the work laptop for example yeah is that

1256
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:25,560
a concern oh yeah yeah that's the bring

1257
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,079
your own device

1258
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:29,700
sort of thing yeah I mean with the

1259
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,579
pandemic that that that's part of the

1260
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:34,619
problem with the pandemic for instance

1261
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,720
like there was it was actually the

1262
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,980
reverse right it was not bringing your

1263
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,200
own device home it's like your home

1264
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,640
becomes like the organizational Network

1265
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,500
and then there are all those issues

1266
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,240
related to that and the decay of the

1267
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,740
system and you cannot push compliance

1268
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,819
because you are not in the network

1269
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,819
system so all those I.T uh you know uh

1270
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:53,640
ID agents cannot really work or work

1271
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,319
good as before so yeah I think it's an

1272
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:58,020
extension of that problem sometimes I'm

1273
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,900
gonna like an anodox in the substation

1274
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,760
the substation for energy are very

1275
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,880
remote sometimes they are unmanned and

1276
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,140
sometimes they are men so when we

1277
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,660
monitor those stuff we see PlayStation

1278
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,660
Raspberry Pi just just going there I

1279
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,099
mean like if you're working there for a

1280
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:15,599
shift which is a night shift you just

1281
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,400
need to be there but not much you get

1282
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,859
bored and although the policy is like we

1283
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,300
do not attach anything to the network

1284
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,579
guess what it happens so yes it's

1285
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:24,780
definitely something to be concerned

1286
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,900
about

1287
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:31,880
the feet over there

1288
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,940
hello hi

1289
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,079
um given how hard it is to patch iot

1290
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,319
devices how should we handle disclosing

1291
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,720
vulnerabilities

1292
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,900
it's a very interesting question so I I

1293
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,260
am a firm believer that we should keep

1294
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,440
doing vulnerability disclosure so like I

1295
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,640
don't agree when saying that like

1296
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,040
keeping it closed will solve the problem

1297
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,440
because it will not what we should do is

1298
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,420
working on initiating for instance like

1299
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,980
this bomb which is the softer bill of

1300
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,079
material in this initiative you actually

1301
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,760
have a list of components that are

1302
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,200
affected so that you're using the

1303
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,359
problem of the supply chain we need to

1304
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,480
make sure that the vendors of iot and OT

1305
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,859
Fields as reliable as accountable for

1306
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,380
bags as they are in the I.T system you

1307
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,319
know like 20 years ago vulnerability

1308
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,619
search for Windows was also treated you

1309
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,119
know like it was also like skeptical

1310
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,400
from the vendors it changed the behavior

1311
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,619
until the moment where the vendor

1312
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,059
themselves they actually have a

1313
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:40,619
vulnerability research program within

1314
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:42,059
their own companies I think we should

1315
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,500
get there also for iot and OT

1316
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:53,280
I got a question as well as it's uh as

1317
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,520
difficult to to patch especially

1318
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,200
OT systems

1319
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,079
um but do you see an interest from the

1320
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,980
vendors in doing those patches and the

1321
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,740
interests from the side of the let's say

1322
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,460
end users to patch those devices or uh

1323
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,859
one of them

1324
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:15,960
is willing to to to do something and the

1325
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,599
other side the the other side doesn't I

1326
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,040
think there are different

1327
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,859
forces on this topic right you can

1328
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:25,200
accept as an asset owner I can even

1329
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,660
accept that the device is vulnerable and

1330
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,040
it will not be patched but I need to

1331
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,960
know not doing the vulnerability

1332
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,460
disclosure will basically mean that I

1333
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,640
trust that device but it's vulnerable

1334
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,520
and then patch maybe is not the is not

1335
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,079
the way because you know the vendor is

1336
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,359
out of business or whatever happened but

1337
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,579
then I can do a risk assessment I can

1338
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,579
see that device is Untouchable has a

1339
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,800
vulnerability for sure needs my

1340
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,200
attention so let me put it in a in a way

1341
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,240
let me secure it around it let me put it

1342
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,160
like behind the firewall let me do the

1343
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,780
segmentation maybe patching is not

1344
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,520
always the solution sometimes we cannot

1345
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,260
stop that it's not on the other hand

1346
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,599
though you know like you need to

1347
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,160
an asset owner as the capabilities to

1348
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,200
actually push and put some pressure on

1349
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,880
the vendor of the device to deliver

1350
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,920
devices that are more secure so I think

1351
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,440
we need to both ways while we are

1352
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,819
educating the community and we are

1353
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,099
slowly changing our mindset there are

1354
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,780
other things that we can do in between I

1355
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,880
mean patching Is Not the Only Solution

1356
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,480
not always

1357
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,000
anyone else

1358
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,579
hi so do you see in the future

1359
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:39,140
regulation

1360
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,420
the necessity to have regulation playing

1361
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,079
a role in in the sense that the vendors

1362
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,300
keep pushing for more and more devices

1363
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,579
to be connected to the internet that can

1364
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:52,440
have a physical impact in the world like

1365
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,859
a toaster a lamp or whatever there's

1366
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,180
this

1367
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,400
there's this competition between vendors

1368
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,440
to have everything connected some of the

1369
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,839
stuff that are being sold as a consumer

1370
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,359
devices have a potential disastrous

1371
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,579
impact in our lives do you think that

1372
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,040
regulation will have to play and step in

1373
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,380
at some point there is a lot of plenty

1374
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,180
of Regulation like especially like

1375
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,480
healthcare for instance like the FDA has

1376
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,460
put off of the market an infusion pump

1377
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,660
because it was uh um it was insecure so

1378
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,300
and both the FDA the CSI and U.S

1379
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,859
especially they are coming with a lot of

1380
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,140
regulations if you have like if you are

1381
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,720
an asset owner in the clinic if you are

1382
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,920
running a critical infrastructure and

1383
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,720
critical infrastructure is a lot like

1384
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,960
Transportation energy even manufacturing

1385
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,540
some sorry in some countries then you

1386
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,880
need to have risk assessment

1387
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,099
and I think vulnerability assessment

1388
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,900
every week so like there are coming

1389
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,059
those kind of regulations they are not

1390
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,599
touching too much the iot consumer but

1391
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,940
like for sure the the Enterprise and the

1392
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,859
organization iot is being touched by

1393
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,020
those they're coming and they are going

1394
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,460
to be quite strict and some of them are

1395
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,640
already

1396
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,680
any more questions

1397
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,720
no thank you all right thank you

1398
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,738
