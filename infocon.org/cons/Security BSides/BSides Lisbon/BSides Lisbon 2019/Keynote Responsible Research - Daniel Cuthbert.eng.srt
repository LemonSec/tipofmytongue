1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,769
well good morning it's a huge honor to

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,830
be here especially doing a keynote for

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,049
such a cool conference I am a

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,160
self-proclaimed

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,349
old fart of the industry I've been

6
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,960
hacking since 1992 and it's quite cool

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,210
to see this many conferences and this

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,800
many people involved and passionate

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,019
about an industry that was really really

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,019
small where we started and even more so

11
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,939
because you know over the last couple of

12
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:31,539
years

13
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,760
Hollywood really has gotten into the

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,430
whole hacking scene and we have amazing

15
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,219
movies that depict hacking today because

16
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,530
everybody today writes worms like this

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,989
you know Hugh Grant and we tap away at

18
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,300
the keyboard and it's quite cool but the

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,180
dark reality is is that hacking as an

20
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,390
industry has become so mainstream now

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,219
when my mother-in-law who is 64 old gets

22
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,960
hold of me when she gets a fisting

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,539
message to say is this legit or am I

24
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,760
going to be attacked so Mike this is

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,290
quite a cool experience for us to be in

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,119
and just have a show of hands how many

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,259
of you are quite new to the industry

28
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,640
less than two years so a fair chunk so

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,659
welcome and Portugal has quite a closer

30
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,060
space in my heart in the early days of

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,409
South Africa when I started to learn to

32
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,329
hack South Africa has a very large

33
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,100
Portuguese community and there are a few

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,650
hacking groups from Portugal that really

35
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,270
did some amazing stuff back in the days

36
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,259
the first was full house I'm doubt

37
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,360
there's anybody here from full house but

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,159
full house were really cool because they

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,990
were kind of one of the first major

40
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,320
exploit groups out there and they did a

41
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,149
lot to really advance the whole exploit

42
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,979
world and it was quite cool to be able

43
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,600
to come and speak in Portugal because I

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,729
knew that they were doing it you then

45
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,310
had toxin and what was interesting about

46
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,130
toxin was toxin with for me was one of

47
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,280
the first politically motivated hacking

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,100
groups out there at the time east tumor

49
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,140
was being evaded and they decided that

50
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,399
they were going to go after anybody

51
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,950
doing bad stuff against that country and

52
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,500
I bear in mind this was 1994 that they

53
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,750
were doing it and then finally it

54
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,940
wouldn't be an industry without trolls

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,830
and our industry does really well with

56
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,300
trolls and for that we had four packs

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,160
four packs at the time were a very

58
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,170
annoying group and but they were very

59
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,640
good at trolling a lot of people on the

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,770
internet back in the day their ultimate

61
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,320
you know downfall was that they decided

62
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,370
to hack a US military organization which

63
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,440
is possibly not the best thing to do if

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,240
you're a small group there are a few

65
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,920
countries in the world you generally try

66
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,140
not to piss off US military is one of

67
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,750
them but what kind of happened is that

68
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,670
like I said hacking has become really

69
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,880
bigger mainstream and we now have

70
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,830
amazing TV shows that actually do depict

71
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,100
what it's like to hack now a lot of you

72
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,780
will realize it's it's not the most

73
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,730
glamorous thing in the world we are

74
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,380
sitting looking at screens tapping the

75
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,030
way wondering why stuff doesn't compile

76
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,280
damn it it worked yesterday why is it

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,740
not working now but the cool thing is is

78
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,480
that every still thinks it's quite an

79
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,340
intriguing industry and actually it is

80
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,160
if you look at it now there are still

81
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,140
some instances where Hollywood gets it

82
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,130
wrong NCIS spins it because I think we

83
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,190
all do double hacking right definitely a

84
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,590
thing and and it's quite interesting to

85
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,880
see that that's how a lot of the

86
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,930
insiders a view our industry and no more

87
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,270
so than the last couple of years there's

88
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,100
been a whole wide range of incidents

89
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,690
that kind of happened to our industry

90
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,860
that's made hacking and hackers quite

91
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,880
predominant in the way that we shaped

92
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,820
the world this gentleman his name is

93
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,220
Marco Ramos he is the San Bernardino's

94
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,430
District Attorney and I think was last

95
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,230
year year before lost when the San

96
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,180
Bernardino terrorist incident happened

97
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,290
where an active shooter went around

98
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,360
shooting people they gained access to

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,810
his my phone sorry and he came up with a

100
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,989
quote that has never left me he said

101
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,530
that there might be a lying dormant to

102
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,800
cyber pathogen on the phone and that

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,930
sums up for me what a lot of outsiders

104
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,930
think about our industry they think that

105
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,560
we create chemical weapons without code

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,709
and in hindsight the more I've thought

107
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,200
about this quote the more of it actually

108
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,530
runs true because we live in a time now

109
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,100
where through our keyboards we can

110
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,580
control companies we can control

111
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,770
continents we call curse shape how

112
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,820
history is made

113
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,090
all through keyboards and if you look at

114
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,100
the FBI they sum this up quite nicely

115
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,160
because they now have their own ciphers

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,669
most wanted now this is the infamous GRU

117
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,320
hacking team for those who you don't

118
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,610
know Russian spies who become hackers

119
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,440
not the best hackers because if you're

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,950
gonna go and hack the you know companies

121
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,140
that look for say doping you generally

122
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,230
don't do it with a pineapple outside of

123
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,360
a rented car sitting looking really

124
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,640
dodgy because for burly Russian men with

125
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
leather jackets they are we gonna do

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,270
some hugging though doesn't it really

127
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,940
fit in upset bro but still they got

128
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,070
caught but the fact of the matter is we

129
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,470
still have the FBI who now has a

130
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,870
dedicated cyber page and this is

131
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,919
fascinating we've come a long way so how

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,300
many of you here remember the old

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,900
dancing baby was wild back in the

134
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,100
early days of the internet that was

135
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,830
cutting-edge and for those who don't you

136
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,910
missed nothing

137
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,760
trust me this is what we thought we were

138
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,450
cool but the irony is we now have 5.1

139
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,340
billion mobile phone users 5.1 billion

140
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,160
people now use the internet today for

141
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
practically most of their digital life

142
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,650
WeChat was launched the other month

143
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,840
WeChat is a great way of paying for

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,150
money using WeChat it's a phenomenal

145
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,580
thing in the first week they gained a

146
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,120
hundred and thirty million customers a

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,470
lot of the stuff that we built and we

148
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,630
engineer and we pen test and we hack

149
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,970
today impacts more people than we've

150
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,840
ever imagined

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,300
so that asked the question surely

152
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,020
security is getting better right not

153
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,729
sure about that and this is a report

154
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,610
from Accenture understanding how some of

155
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,289
the breaches are happening and some of

156
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:28,969
the stuff is quite

157
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,079
telling as somebody who's been involved

158
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,059
in security for a very long time it's

159
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,539
also a little bit embarrassing because

160
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,159
malware is it up web-based attacks up

161
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,319
dalila servers up the fact of the matter

162
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,279
is it's never been easier to hack we now

163
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,409
have the likes of YouTube we have more

164
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,360
information being shared before and ever

165
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,269
and yet seemingly we're still struggling

166
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,599
with making stuff quite secure and that

167
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,579
moves into the next one you can't talk

168
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,799
about hacking that talking about

169
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:02,889
politics the fact of the matter remains

170
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,599
our weapons are our keyboards I know

171
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,369
that's a very cliche thing to say on a

172
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,709
Friday morning in Lisbon but the

173
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:13,959
realities is quite true because

174
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,999
organisations and government units are

175
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,819
now using a lot of our research to

176
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,189
seriously start impacting normal human

177
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,829
life so it's a known fact that the

178
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,479
Saudis are not the nicest players in the

179
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,110
world and this story came out excuse me

180
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,689
the other week where it turns out that

181
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:33,860
they were going against human rights

182
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,949
activists and owning their devices and

183
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,899
forcing them to say nice things about

184
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,929
His Royal Highness they managed to do so

185
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,199
from a company that I will happily call

186
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,279
the internet cancer NSO group a company

187
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,649
that loves to peddle misery on to lots

188
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,809
and lots of people around the world and

189
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:57,469
they do so to the highest bidder then

190
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,629
last week we learned about the tonic

191
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:02,179
cables now the China cables was quite

192
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,709
interesting because we finally got

193
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,479
insight through a lot of leaked

194
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,659
documents as to how China is creating

195
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,369
the biggest mass surveillance system

196
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:13,489
this planet has ever seen surveillance

197
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:16,399
of we Gers the Weger Muslims against

198
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,049
people who go against the Chinese

199
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:20,360
government and they do so through a

200
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,309
massive complex networks of surveillance

201
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,349
infiltration exfiltration and tracking

202
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,829
of people and that is facilitated by a

203
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:34,068
large our industry and our industry

204
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,318
helps all of that but the good thing is

205
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:38,479
we also have a lot of internet cyber

206
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:38,899
sleuths

207
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,759
and no there's a talk later about

208
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,049
scanning the Internet

209
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,149
and it's because of stuff like this

210
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,320
where Victor givers managed to find this

211
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,790
company who was working with the Chinese

212
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,910
you know a communist party called sense

213
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,310
net who struggles with security just

214
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,200
like everybody else and they somehow

215
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,570
managed to leave a lot of databases

216
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,630
online those databases showed how big

217
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,870
this problem was six point seven million

218
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,260
location points linked to people tagged

219
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,700
with descriptions such as mosque Hotel

220
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,560
internet cafe and other places where

221
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,329
surveillance cameras were cameras were

222
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,269
most likely installed we've helped

223
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,640
facilitate such an industrial

224
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,430
surveillance system through a lot of our

225
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,709
research and I think that's one of the

226
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,910
things that's concerned me as a

227
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,279
researcher as to how much we're helping

228
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,880
these countries do really bad stuff but

229
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,339
at the same time human beings also

230
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,510
helped us along so this is an app on the

231
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,970
left could sale it is the most

232
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,920
downloaded free app and the Chinese app

233
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,800
store as of September this year and I'm

234
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,329
sure many of you have tried it did

235
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,490
anybody else try the Facebook app where

236
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,990
you manage to age yourself show of hands

237
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,230
nobody tried it phenomenon and this app

238
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,600
might seem quite innocent you can

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,250
pretend to be your favorite Chinese

240
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,930
movie star or anybody else

241
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,570
the harsh reality here on this app is

242
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,610
that it was actually used to train

243
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,560
machine learning models to do

244
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,820
surveillance of persecuted minorities

245
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,050
because how else would you manage to

246
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,610
train models on millions of people

247
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,880
without saying his acute app run it oh

248
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,760
you look like Leonardo DiCaprio that's

249
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,240
great

250
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,120
the reality is is that we're hoping a

251
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,980
lot of these regimes do ugly stuff and

252
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,019
then you have companies that shape

253
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,880
democracy itself now unfortunately I

254
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,589
live in a country called England and

255
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,320
England is full of weird racists who

256
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,980
think that exiting the United Union was

257
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,970
a good thing

258
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,340
now it's a bit of an embarrassment but

259
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,440
the reality was is that the brexit

260
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,690
campaign was not a free and fair

261
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,570
campaign it was manipulated by a company

262
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,000
called Cambridge analytical Christopher

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,040
Wylie was one of the data scientists and

264
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,370
they had a simple idea what happens if

265
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,000
we bring big data and social media to an

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,700
established military methodology the

267
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,980
methodology of psyops psychological

268
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,470
operations and what they did was they

269
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,470
targeted individuals in regions of the

270
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,970
United Kingdom where they knew that they

271
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,220
could subvert their thoughts and force

272
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,570
them to vote for something they never

273
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,790
really thought about and do so by

274
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,390
constant lombardi of images of messages

275
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,580
and so on and that's effectively how

276
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,890
Cambridge annulled the word they used

277
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,870
sort meant they use humans they used

278
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,210
second they used a lot of military terms

279
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,370
and they managed to sway an entire

280
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,170
population to vote for something that

281
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,870
was incredibly stupid but they also did

282
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,450
against the US electric all using

283
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,270
technology and ideas that was spoken

284
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,570
about a conference as years before so

285
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,090
it's really hard to go through and do

286
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,650
what we do without understanding the

287
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,030
impact that we have in the world and

288
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,430
from a personal perspective that's

289
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,090
impacted me eight times now this is apt

290
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,780
33 the Iranian National Guard and as

291
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,670
with all countries out there they've

292
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,380
made use of hacking techniques to gain

293
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,680
access to information and ideas that

294
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,420
wouldn't necessarily be part of what

295
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,760
they would normally access Iran has

296
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,590
plenty of sanctions on it so the only

297
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,490
way they're going to get access to

298
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,250
information is through breaking in and

299
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,570
we learnt last year that unfortunately

300
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,420
Iran used a tool that I helped push out

301
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,670
onto the internet called ruler and that

302
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,320
was how they gained access to a lot of

303
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,140
large scale industrial enterprises and

304
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,330
it's it's quite an easy with you when

305
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,010
you realize that something that you help

306
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,650
build your proof of concept the stuff

307
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,480
that you thought was good in trying to

308
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,700
change the world was actually being used

309
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,250
for evil but it also made me realize

310
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,650
that you can't be naive in this industry

311
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,810
do not think that we are being watched

312
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,200
quite

313
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,530
heavily that wasn't also the first time

314
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,000
there's plenty more as this tool going

315
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,630
to then finally the juggernaut in the

316
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,360
room everybody here's aware of kim

317
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,800
yeongman

318
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,090
probably built the greatest hacking team

319
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,580
ever known to man loves to ride horses

320
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,890
and takes long walks and forests but

321
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,840
what he did do was weaponized north

322
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,510
korean aspects so that when they target

323
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,120
companies or countries there was not

324
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,170
much you could do to give an example if

325
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,060
North Korea is attacking your network

326
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,810
what do you do you can go to local law

327
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,850
enforcement who will probably look at

328
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,430
you and go I don't know what you want me

329
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,800
to do it's North Korea you then go to

330
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,290
your politician and your politician will

331
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,690
probably say it's North Korea it's

332
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,670
tricky there sanctions but they also

333
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,890
have nuclear weapons and they're pretty

334
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,650
big that was the effectiveness of North

335
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,980
Korea and what Kim managed to do was do

336
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,540
something that a lot of smaller

337
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,920
criminals wanted to do for a very very

338
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,400
long time and that was break into banks

339
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,890
and he did so in Bangladesh but what was

340
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,490
interesting about the whole process was

341
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,620
his team adopted very similar agile

342
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,930
approaches and techniques that had been

343
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,970
spoken about for a very long time prior

344
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,310
to that so here are two pieces of

345
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,410
malware on the left

346
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,390
it was the samples submitted from the

347
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,180
Bangladesh Swift attack right on the

348
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,760
right this was a relatively new sample

349
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,070
that's been pushed in and the one thing

350
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,170
who people who can't wrote a simile is

351
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,480
that you'll see that the code is very

352
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,450
similar but it has small modifications

353
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,230
and that was key to how North Korea does

354
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,630
a lot of their intrusions they never

355
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,430
stopped morphing they never stopped

356
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,220
changing their code right because the

357
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,660
one good thing that came out of the

358
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,940
Bangladesh hack was that the global

359
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,430
Swift network finally realized they had

360
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,740
to make stuff a lot more secure and they

361
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,110
did so but that didn't stop the North

362
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,780
Korean unit one-to-one or Lazarus or any

363
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,790
of those small groups inside the

364
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,170
industrial machine that is North Korea

365
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,690
from adapting modern techniques that

366
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,850
they saw at conferences and they saw

367
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,740
online they saw and github

368
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,220
go how do we stay one step ahead now

369
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,310
instantly that sample on the right would

370
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,110
break Sierra and a lot of other

371
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,529
signature based detection moon booties

372
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,140
so for all casein matters North Korea

373
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,060
was very good at keeping up to date with

374
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,910
what the security industry was doing but

375
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,959
they also learnt a lot from what we did

376
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,459
as I said Kim Jung has got some

377
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,410
fantastic taste in horses and you know

378
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,959
photo photography I wouldn't like to be

379
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,550
the photographer who was told to take a

380
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,649
picture of kim yeon and you know if you

381
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,029
get it wrong your whole family's wiped

382
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,390
out but the key thing is if you look at

383
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,500
any of the breaches that have happened

384
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,020
from North Korea there's key things that

385
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,930
we can learn one the attackers had

386
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,790
access to companies for a very long time

387
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,500
in some cases over 180 days which means

388
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,200
we as defenders and we as the security

389
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,390
industry are very bad at detecting when

390
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,270
stuff is happening inside our networks

391
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,720
to the malware was compiled days or

392
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,149
hours before actually being used and

393
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,220
this was really interesting because a

394
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,720
lot of the times when you do a red team

395
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,760
you don't necessarily do it on the fly

396
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,610
the North Koreans realize that by doing

397
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,500
it on the fly often they were able to

398
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,029
bypass a health road protection

399
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:40,339
mechanism only they made use of innocent

400
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,860
Decrypter often stuff that was found

401
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,310
scraped from github these were innocent

402
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,959
projects that somebody might have pushed

403
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,550
outline thinking who's going to be using

404
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,980
this when in reality it was being used

405
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,990
to break into banks finally they did

406
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,279
something that we've been doing for a

407
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,160
long time they didn't work in office

408
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,589
hours they didn't keep in scope

409
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,869
these are attack is breaking into stuff

410
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,640
to see lots of money so they were

411
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
learning a lot from what the red team

412
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,359
pentesting industry has been saying for

413
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,939
a long time but it's just we weren't

414
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,270
very good at acting about it but all of

415
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,510
that pales in comparison to the real

416
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,130
master hacking crew and that's China

417
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,660
one thing you have to hand it to China

418
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,929
China is that they've managed to

419
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,530
industrialize a

420
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,180
weaponize hacking like I've never seen

421
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,640
before interesting story Beijing decided

422
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,240
and predicted that the demand for air

423
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,250
travel in its growing middle class

424
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,980
Chinese communities would outstrip

425
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,890
demand and supply so what they needed to

426
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,310
do was build a turbine engine that could

427
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,010
facilitates the Chinese movement across

428
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,040
the world and part of that was they

429
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,160
wanted to make sure that the China

430
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,500
approach of being an advanced

431
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,680
manufacturing leader was in operation

432
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,960
and to do so they decided they were

433
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,750
gonna build a plane and that plane was

434
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,690
the c919 now what was different about

435
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,300
this plane was that it was going to be

436
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,050
half the price of any Western equivalent

437
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,730
now for any of you who built had been

438
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,130
involved in the aeronautical industry

439
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,350
it's a very complex industry a single

440
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,810
plane is made up of many many companies

441
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,090
with many many different parts alright

442
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,680
you don't have a single plane built by

443
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,380
one country or company so what the

444
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,140
Chinese did was they thought between the

445
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,980
period of 2010 and 2015 they would use

446
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,050
their amazing hacking teams which was a

447
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,330
combination of Chinese underground

448
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,190
hackers and the Ministry of State

449
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,860
Security MSS and they would breach

450
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,690
most of the companies in this picture

451
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,760
and they would become sleepers in the

452
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,750
network that was the first thing the

453
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,610
second thing that they did was they

454
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,480
partnered with a company called CFM

455
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,430
International which was a joint venture

456
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,490
between France and the USA and that is

457
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,740
the leap ex engine that's a phenomenal

458
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,600
turbine engine which could be used for

459
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,910
both the airplane and the ministry at

460
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,850
the military in the industry they signed

461
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,220
the agreements but what happened a

462
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,820
couple of years afterwards was China

463
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,030
said we need to make our own so making

464
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,480
use of underground hackers and MSF's

465
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,540
they came up with this amazing engine

466
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,700
that had multiple similarities with the

467
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,789
leap engine

468
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,370
stuff that was damn near identical

469
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,309
dimensions for turbofan blades how it

470
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,850
operated now the cynical person and you

471
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,980
might think maybe it was just your thing

472
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,169
you know two designers working on an

473
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:56,049
engine separated by an ocean it must be

474
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:59,770
the same the reality is China made use

475
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,320
of the most powerful weapon that we've

476
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,789
ever seen in hacking humans now for

477
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,830
those who are not military based humans

478
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,850
is the art of the human what China did

479
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,429
was they managed to put a whole lot of

480
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,190
insiders into a lot of key important

481
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,429
companies and use those insiders to help

482
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,340
feed and grow the Chinese drive to

483
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,690
become the most advanced manufacturing

484
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,200
country in the world and they did so by

485
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,899
using exfiltration by using covert comms

486
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,330
by steaming lots and lots of data and

487
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,270
this is a fascinating story because what

488
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,390
MSS did was they attended conferences

489
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,570
they attended black hat and DEF CON and

490
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,789
b-sides and they looked through github

491
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:47,710
and they looked at people pushing out

492
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,630
proof of concepts and they used that

493
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,720
information to really push forward the

494
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,850
main goal and that main goal was

495
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,240
exfiltration of data so it's a deadly I

496
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,070
said on The Blackout Review Board and we

497
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,020
review thousands of thousands of

498
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,970
submissions every year three years ago

499
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,250
we noticed a complete drop of any

500
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,049
submission from any Chinese researcher

501
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,630
and it was interesting because at the

502
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,490
time we would get a lot of very good

503
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,559
research from Chinese researchers but

504
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,779
that all pretty much stopped and it was

505
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,330
due to Chinese government saying all

506
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,429
your research now belongs to China you

507
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:22,870
do not publish it anywhere else in the

508
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,779
world so we could see the control that a

509
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,610
country would have on the hacking

510
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,340
community and we're now as we started to

511
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,840
dig further and further we start to

512
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,559
understand the impact of that research

513
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,169
and then finally like I said you can't

514
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,539
talk about the internet without talking

515
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,740
about its cancer

516
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,059
there'll be here familiar with the NSO

517
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,309
group couple NSO group is a charming

518
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,529
company based in Israel and effectively

519
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:56,789
they are a lord of war they will for a

520
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,010
considerable amount of money sell you

521
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,350
access to people's mobile phones and

522
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,750
digital devices in order to exfiltrate

523
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,980
data now unfortunately they don't care

524
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,320
who they sell it to unlike you know

525
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,809
normal countries but we don't generally

526
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,760
go after those who try particular rights

527
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,100
and a so group will go after anybody for

528
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,390
you and they built this amazing

529
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,149
framework called Pegasus and Pegasus is

530
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,399
effectively a c2 malware delivery

531
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:26,039
framework on steroids the average costs

532
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,080
is about fifteen million and it works

533
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,149
really well because it has all the

534
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,590
things that you'd expect from a

535
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,380
commercial weaponized c2 framework we've

536
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,880
got our installations we have data

537
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,409
collection data transmission and

538
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,380
presentation and analysis but what

539
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,990
Pegasus managed to do was make it

540
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,980
point-and-click easy for any operator to

541
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,429
go off to people to deliver malware now

542
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,770
with us undetectable and then use that

543
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,000
against those people and this framework

544
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,880
managed to collect a lot of data

545
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,770
effectively everything in your mobile

546
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,620
phone will full game now in recent

547
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,760
months there has been reports where the

548
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,679
NSO have managed to have a finger put

549
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,140
into their eye notably from Natasha at

550
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,059
Google Project zero with the whatsapp

551
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:15,860
bugs

552
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,929
their reach was like something I'd never

553
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,210
seen before because you now had regimes

554
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,149
like the Saudis and the Bangladeshis and

555
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,830
everybody else who you would never want

556
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,470
to have a weapon like this have access

557
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,919
to this to go after really key people

558
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,690
NSO group managed to do this through a

559
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,480
lot of our research and they made use of

560
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,860
a lot of the concepts that we talked

561
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,840
about the ideas and the proof of

562
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,669
concepts that we push out to do this

563
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,950
kind of damage and to give you an idea

564
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,120
of how bad it was in Mexico they decided

565
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,000
that the sugar in soda drinks was a bad

566
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,550
thing

567
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,490
and rightly so so there was a sugar tax

568
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,670
coming in and you know child obesity is

569
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,440
getting worse you know we know for a

570
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,510
fact that sugar in the likes of coke and

571
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,890
Founder and so on is not the best thing

572
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,860
well it seems that certain organizations

573
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,120
would have lost a lot of money about

574
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,820
this so what they did was they targeted

575
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,890
the politicians who were trying to bring

576
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,550
in this law and they did so using NSF

577
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,580
capability but they took it one step

578
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,010
further out of interest how many people

579
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,330
in this room do pentesting or red

580
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,520
teaming sir fairview what they did was

581
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
for the individuals that they knew that

582
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,120
they could subvert and they wanted to

583
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,950
keep tracks on they sent sms's now this

584
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,610
SMS basically said mr. Simon your

585
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,620
daughter was in a grave accident really

586
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,330
bad condition you need to come to the

587
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,470
hospital now here's a link now it might

588
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,630
look really really lame to a lot of the

589
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,420
red teams and pen testers but this was

590
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,220
really effective because I'm a father of

591
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,680
two boys and if somebody had to send a

592
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,140
message to me saying hey one of your

593
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,540
kids has been a bad accident you kind of

594
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,900
do lose the ability to think clearly and

595
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,360
they sent hundreds of these messages to

596
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,710
everybody involved in the sugar tax

597
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,680
thing and this was all facilitated by

598
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,330
NSO technology but it's not always been

599
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:16,930
like that

600
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,970
so the early days of hacking like I said

601
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,420
I started in the early 90s and that was

602
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,310
a phenomenal time for me to be in the

603
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,500
research world because the internet was

604
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,510
kind of growing up we were starting to

605
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,860
see this thing called the World Wide Web

606
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,890
yes to those who've never imagined it we

607
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,380
didn't have the World Wide Web it was

608
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,660
really bad but we also used a lot of

609
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,440
creativity and so in 2001 I helped build

610
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,210
a project called smooth wall smooth wall

611
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,850
was a firewall and at the time I was

612
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,320
working at a company called Pierce on it

613
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,810
and I'm Pierce on it my main job was

614
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,090
hoping to build the first generation

615
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,310
Internet now hosting was really really

616
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,340
expensive and we also needed to put out

617
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,930
a patch for vulnerability that we found

618
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,380
in SSH so what we did was well what I

619
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,280
did was using my hacker mindset

620
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,680
was that the one four six one oh one one

621
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,610
26.9 IP address' was actually a hosting

622
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,460
server ride commandeered to push patches

623
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,650
out because I couldn't afford hosting it

624
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,790
was really expensive so I thought well

625
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,140
let me just borrow somebody else's at

626
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,720
the time that was the hacking mindset

627
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,120
you know we built stuff we explored

628
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,190
stuff and we did lots of interesting

629
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,740
stuff and now when we were finding bugs

630
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,740
we did share it among other people so

631
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,330
earlier I mentioned Paul has you know

632
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,670
there were a lot of shouts going out you

633
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,710
would find a bug you proved that it was

634
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,110
an issue you'd write exploit code for my

635
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,120
sins I wrote it in Perl don't judge me

636
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,510
it was a different error and when you

637
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,980
were bored of the exploit you were

638
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,110
either moving on to a Friends group or

639
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,970
you do a trade just like pedro talked

640
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,400
about yesterday trading hardware we used

641
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,170
to do the same with exploits now you

642
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,910
would be an idiot to do that because

643
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,710
you'd make a lot of money so no beat

644
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,020
trades exploits anymore at least that

645
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,400
way but there was one incident that kind

646
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,050
of started a massive movement against

647
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,720
this and that was CV 2002 Oh 392 I'm

648
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,770
sure a lot of you probably would

649
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,520
remember this one

650
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,310
but that was a chanting coding

651
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,490
vulnerability for Apache 1.3 now I'm

652
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,370
really showing my age but effectively if

653
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,770
you sent a payload to an Apache web

654
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,800
server bad things happened but it's fine

655
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,530
because we had in we had experts all

656
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,870
right so we had this company called

657
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,730
Internet Security Systems Picross

658
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,640
rueland and these experts decided it was

659
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,660
not exploitable right they were strict

660
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,840
about that cannot exploit it thankfully

661
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,040
there was a group out there called

662
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,190
gobbles gobbles were phenomenal they

663
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,230
were a breath of fresh air and they

664
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,170
decided you know what actually we're

665
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,300
gonna look at the code and they said

666
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,120
that the experts have said it is not

667
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,200
exploitable on 32-bit NICs variants it's

668
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,100
only invoke exploitable 132

669
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,350
and what gobbles did was now the

670
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,570
infamous Apache nose job exploit that

671
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,809
targeted both Sun Solaris 6.8 FreeBSD

672
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:18,010
OpenBSD and Linux effectively 99% of the

673
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,570
internet this single exploit was used a

674
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,919
lot it was used against Theo de Raadt

675
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,360
they took down a server called monkey

676
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,960
org monkey dog was a server for a lot of

677
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,730
the big security researchers of the time

678
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,330
Doug song k2 a lot of people their

679
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,360
server got out in fact Apache nose-job

680
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,190
who was used to break into so many

681
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,409
servers then it wasn't even funny

682
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:46,360
anymore because if you won the Internet

683
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,390
there was no patch you were being

684
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,620
rampaged I'm mad now that kicked off a

685
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,929
massive amount of discussion and

686
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:57,940
instantly this happened yesterday so

687
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,520
zero is a friend of mine and she managed

688
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,020
to tweet out saying responsible to

689
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,909
slowed bugs published with the proof of

690
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,289
concept to doing more harm than good

691
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,179
since they're being weaponized and used

692
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,850
by attackers this is not a new argument

693
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,010
this argument has been going around for

694
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,559
a very very long time actually 20 years

695
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,830
20 years ago a very very annoying at the

696
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,330
time group called el8 published a series

697
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,150
of scenes here late was the start of the

698
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,030
anti security movement and what they

699
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,850
wanted to do was eliminate the entire

700
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,419
security industry that did reports about

701
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,280
news about exports about proof of

702
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,860
concepts and at the time it was quite

703
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,260
annoying because they termed it Project

704
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,220
Mayhem and this couples logged experts

705
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,470
how they had was the basis of them

706
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,559
saying enough now by us releasing the

707
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,330
research that gives attack as the skills

708
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,159
and the tools they need to do we're not

709
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,820
doing anything good for the Internet and

710
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,130
it was pretty good because you know at

711
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,530
the time I was on the receiving end of

712
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,600
this and a lot of people I would expect

713
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,789
to read this but effectively they wanted

714
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:12,669
to stop people pushing it out there's

715
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:13,900
one site there that you might notice

716
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,160
called hack Koza

717
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,090
that was probably one of the first

718
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,950
exploit sites that I was involved in and

719
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,910
help run we used to give away exploits

720
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,440
very similar to mill one now but

721
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,650
effectively we were hey one-stop Google

722
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,510
for him when it came to exploits bear in

723
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,820
mind this was 1999 and we used to host

724
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,590
it and we used to get owned a lot and we

725
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,700
used to move it around

726
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,100
in hindsight probably not the best thing

727
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,860
to do but we were young and naive and it

728
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,990
served the purpose that we thought but

729
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,700
it was a key part of the scene back then

730
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,799
here late took a lot of offense against

731
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,340
this and their message now if you look

732
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,780
20 years later is quite important

733
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,730
because you know for those who remember

734
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,370
bug track bug track was effectively the

735
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,049
place you'd go to disclose all all the

736
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:03,240
bugs you had it was also great as an

737
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,370
attacker to understand what I could own

738
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,780
and what I could weaponize and they went

739
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,340
against it this kind of made me realize

740
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,590
that I know my Portuguese so terrible

741
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,409
that something had to drastically change

742
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,470
now like I said I've had a lot of

743
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,419
personal backed where people were using

744
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,900
our research for bad so I used to run a

745
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,820
company called sense post and we used to

746
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,580
put a lot of offensive weapons out there

747
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,200
one of the weapons was called quit sir

748
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,520
quit sir was an idea by Chris to take a

749
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,280
android apk and easily backdoor it where

750
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,770
you didn't require any skills so you

751
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,870
could push it out and have a backboard

752
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,960
version of an application sounds good

753
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,370
it was used to highlight the fact that

754
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,950
Google Play Store and Android itself

755
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,440
wasn't very good at detecting this what

756
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,390
we didn't expect was the hundreds of

757
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,049
YouTube tutorials by so many people that

758
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:06,780
were now using this to own a lot of

759
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,929
people and the ramp up from

760
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,690
proof-of-concept to weaponize code was

761
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,510
something like I've never seen before

762
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,929
then in 2011 a colleague of mine Glen

763
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:21,720
and I had a research idea to build a

764
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,090
thing called Snoopy Snoopy was a

765
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,610
distributed master bail

766
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,740
system that maids use of the floor that

767
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,320
we found in the Wi-Fi stack and we did

768
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,809
so by doing a proof-of-concept in two

769
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:36,530
places one we did it in London we built

770
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,710
our drones and we went through all the

771
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,570
major hotspots in London during rush

772
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,490
hour and caught about a hundred thousand

773
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,290
people in our dragnet this was pre

774
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,750
Snowden and we were able to track where

775
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,640
that person was coming from where they

776
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,710
lives their common places of interest

777
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,549
and so on

778
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:54,740
but there was an element to Snoopy that

779
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,850
we wanted to try out there was a lot

780
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,470
more evil and that was the malicious

781
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,340
full active exploitation and we're best

782
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,549
to try this out and blackhat because if

783
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,230
you go to the blackout conference and

784
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,320
you are not doing good security on your

785
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,809
mobile phone or you're an idiot so I

786
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,190
spoke to Jeff and ping I said listen

787
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,320
here is our idea we want to put up a

788
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,750
dragnet of malicious drones all over the

789
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,940
place and pone the crap out of everybody

790
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,830
connecting into it they're like sure

791
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,410
it's black out go ahead and we did tens

792
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,880
of thousands of people had their devices

793
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,120
owned we proved the point a cake or

794
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,650
picked up we worked with Google and

795
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,720
Android to fix the flaw what we didn't

796
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,640
expect was how the Snoopy technology

797
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,940
would be used in a malicious way and it

798
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,190
was only years afterwards did we get

799
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,679
insight that there were companies in

800
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,020
Israel selling Snoopy based technology

801
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,380
to spy on Palestinians where our

802
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,940
research was being found in the Middle

803
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,049
East or parts of Eastern Europe where

804
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,490
they didn't care about who they went

805
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,730
after and even closer to home a company

806
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,919
decided to use the stupid technology to

807
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,149
spy on people via the bins we never

808
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,219
imagined this to be happening but we

809
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,960
were incredibly naive at the time

810
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,480
so the whole anti SEC movement actually

811
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,409
had a point because we were helping

812
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,109
people do nasty stuff now I thought it

813
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,599
quite fitting that 20 years after the

814
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,040
policy came out and not many people

815
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,809
knowing about it it was probably maybe

816
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,399
the good time to start reading thinking

817
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,559
about that and the policy itself is

818
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,569
quite simple right it's also very

819
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:38,819
controversial do not tell the world

820
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:41,460
about security bugs you find how many

821
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,440
people here have found bugs in the last

822
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,690
year and publicly told people about them

823
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,069
how many have managed to find those bugs

824
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,599
and do responsible disclosure with the

825
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,649
vendor it's quite a few it is a very

826
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:58,829
frustrating process to do vendors do not

827
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,319
want to listen there is an argument for

828
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,200
proof of concepts there's not an

829
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,030
argument for taking a proof of concept

830
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,859
and put it on the internet and I think

831
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,089
that's one of the biggest things that

832
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:10,829
I'm starting to see that this industry

833
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:13,020
needs we need to become a little bit

834
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,109
more responsible we have responsible

835
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:16,829
drink-driving

836
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:19,500
if ever there was such a thing we have

837
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,319
responsible drinking so why don't we

838
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:26,339
have responsible research because as I

839
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:29,069
showed earlier we do have the capability

840
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,670
of really impacting how this world works

841
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,390
through code through our keyboards and

842
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,150
Maggie stone who is part of Google

843
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,369
project zero obviously has a

844
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:43,559
counter-argument Google project zero

845
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,049
very good friends of mine do an amazing

846
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:47,760
thing for this world they really do what

847
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,900
Ben and professor have done is

848
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,770
phenomenal but she also has a point by

849
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,109
providing proof of concepts it does help

850
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:57,690
they're stubborn vendors understand that

851
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,150
it's not really acceptable for you to

852
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,920
push out bad college quality code

853
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,200
anymore and I think that's where this

854
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,609
industry needs to grow up a little bit

855
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:09,119
we still accept poor code and that's

856
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,030
something that needs to change

857
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,640
but it's not all bad things the hacking

858
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,190
community is still very very well alive

859
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,119
so last week finneus Fisher who is

860
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,859
he/she/it were not sure it could be a

861
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,650
group a phenomenal hacker decided to do

862
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,140
something quite interesting they hacked

863
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,930
a bank in the Cayman Islands and they

864
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,309
managed to see a lot of money and

865
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:34,769
they've put together a bug bounty for

866
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:37,410
hackers to go after companies that do

867
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,309
bad things

868
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:41,009
the NSO's of the world the halliburton's

869
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:43,349
and so on so the hacking community is

870
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:45,299
still there we're not all corporate

871
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:46,710
shills some are not all dangerous

872
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,789
anymore because we don't do anything

873
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,549
cool but I still think we have an

874
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:53,190
amazing thing to shape this fourth

875
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,539
Industrial Revolution that we're going

876
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:58,190
through because we can collaborate a lot

877
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,359
for those who don't do that as that is

878
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,589
the ledger any white rapper called

879
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:07,529
Vanilla Ice very misunderstood so my

880
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:08,789
call to you today after you see all

881
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:11,720
these amazing talks is we do cool stuff

882
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,210
we learn we share but there's an element

883
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,920
of responsibility we also need to start

884
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,170
thinking about now because you are being

885
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:19,740
watched

886
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,460
it's inevitable so thank you very much

887
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,420
enjoy the rest of the conference

888
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,570
[Applause]

889
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:49,750
so any questions hello Daniel so I have

890
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,940
a question regarding conferences because

891
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,040
I think that as I talked about yesterday

892
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,020
I think there's some sort of

893
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,020
glamorization I think of security

894
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,900
research there's this special status

895
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,280
that we give to researchers and for some

896
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,280
people that motivation is to go public

897
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,220
at some point with their research right

898
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,950
so how does the industry then move to a

899
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,170
position where we support a different

900
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,990
sort of framework of working because the

901
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,540
ideas that you're talking about can't

902
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,960
exist in the current structure though

903
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,700
the way that we talk about ideas with

904
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,900
each other it's a good question one of

905
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,250
the things that we're trying to drive

906
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,000
it's a black hat is previously you would

907
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,940
idolize and call somebody releasing

908
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,510
expert code that made say this pop a

909
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,810
root shell as a rock star and I think

910
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,190
that's been the wrong attitude to have

911
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,910
because I'm gonna be very controversial

912
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,700
now it's not hard to hack anymore I'm

913
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,180
sorry

914
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,790
it really isn't what's really hard to do

915
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,800
is to stop stuff like this being

916
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,080
exploited and I think we've put the

917
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,900
wrong emphasis on the rock stars the

918
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,150
mega security researchers who do that

919
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,650
kind of stuff rather than celebrate

920
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,870
those who are actually protecting you

921
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,520
know critical infrastructure protecting

922
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,610
ATM networks protecting pacemakers from

923
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,620
being owned and I think we need this

924
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,050
massive shift where we the industry go

925
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,730
you know that's just not that cool

926
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,360
anymore like you managed to get a

927
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,249
internet-connected dildo to do something

928
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:35,749
cool bro we need to move away from that

929
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,429
but I think it's gonna take a lot more

930
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,529
than just idiots like me rambling - a

931
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,089
lot of you go that's just not cool

932
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,519
anymore so I don't know have an easier

933
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,140
answer and I think it's it's a very hard

934
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,130
problem that we can have to try and fix

935
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,959
but I'm hoping we're gonna try at least

936
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:58,109
talk about it else always a good sign

937
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:00,569
with this no questions you know okay so

938
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:03,160
thank you very much Daniel

939
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,290
[Applause]

940
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,420
