1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,870
hello everyone hope everyone has had

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,420
good lunch and that you're not too

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,490
sleepy cuz after lunch I tend to get my

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,269
power nap in so let's see for those of

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,369
you that don't know who binary edge is

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,679
actually let me get a quick measure if

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,179
you've heard of binary edge can you put

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,759
your hand up real quick that's not too

9
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,419
bad so we every time if you've seen at

10
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,790
all done by us it will probably have

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,500
been on internet scanning because that's

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,870
what we do we scan the internet around

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,230
250 times per month on different ports

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,700
we consume that data we sell that data

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,040
we do stuff with that data but this year

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,570
we actually decided we wanted to talk

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,920
about something new that we've been

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,930
doing we understood that by just

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,270
scanning the internet or talking to the

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,100
Internet we were actually having a bit

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,370
of a gap which was who else is doing it

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,620
what are they doing what can we learn

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,570
from it and we decided to give this talk

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,040
about a new system we set up that

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,559
involves actually having honey pots and

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,539
I wanted to talk a little bit about some

27
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,799
of the things we've learned with the

28
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,929
data and if it's worth or not for you

29
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,630
guys to have a honey pot these days if I

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,070
can ask one more question which is

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,990
important for this talk how many of you

32
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,390
work in a monitoring position like a

33
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,159
sock and knock can you just put your

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,710
hands up okay cool

35
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,020
so this is our agenda for today the

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,789
things that we do we do at scale that

37
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,649
means you know having them spread all

38
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,049
over the internet not just like 100 watt

39
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,600
or 200 watts it means they need to be

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,479
replicable fast and do a bunch of more

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,649
interesting things we're going to talk

42
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,600
about some of the data and some of the

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,979
things that we found in terms of

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,350
patterns and anomalies and also what are

45
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,819
the benefits to having honey pots these

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,240
days so when thinking about honey pots

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,740
we decided that we wanted to understand

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,329
what other people were doing we thought

49
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,920
okay so what are the any pots

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,279
requirements for us and we ended up you

51
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,170
know gathering this list it needs to be

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,490
portable run on x86 x64 or arm because

53
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,439
we might want to put it in a server we

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,848
might want to put it in a Raspberry Pi

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,550
that sits at home as well

56
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,750
because there is a difference between

57
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,850
listening on an enterprise IP address

58
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,320
and listening on the residential IP

59
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
address so we needed to make it

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,070
compatible wide we need to have dynamic

61
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,960
configuration deployment and what this

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,840
means is we needed to edit one file

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,660
commit that file and essentially change

64
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,940
the configuration globally on all of the

65
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,740
any pots that means for example if on

66
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,750
port 80 we want to start giving a

67
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,580
specific response on some specific honey

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,800
pots I do not want to connect to all the

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,110
unnie pots I need to edit one file edit

70
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,970
that one file and it deploys to all the

71
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,200
Ana pots in one go

72
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,030
they need to be easily deployment

73
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,310
because we deploy at least for scanning

74
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,550
around 200 to 250 scanning agents every

75
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,440
month and we rotate them all we wanted

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
to be able to do the same thing for

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,860
honey pots a new data center pops up we

78
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,090
need to be able to deploy in there

79
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,120
within seconds real time if you've used

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,410
the binary edge platform or you know

81
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,910
about us you know that all of our

82
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,070
platform works in real time everything

83
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,750
is an event that's why we also need add

84
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,670
event based but everything works in real

85
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,590
time if someone connects to one of our

86
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,150
honey pots we want to see that event

87
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,610
within milliseconds on our central

88
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,830
platform as well we needed a tagging

89
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,390
system because one of the important

90
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,800
things it's not just about receiving

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
traffic right you need to understand

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,209
what that traffic means and we wanted to

93
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,220
be able to give tags specific to the

94
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,510
events and we're going to go to what all

95
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,400
these things means and we also needed

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
anomaly detection and again we'll go

97
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
through what that means in a little bit

98
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,310
so what we landed on was having a custom

99
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,040
written solution in Python 3 and for the

100
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,200
tagging and the configurations we have

101
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,090
these files and if you guys look at them

102
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,650
they're actually fairly simple

103
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,230
configuration files so for example if on

104
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,110
port if we receive a string called eh

105
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,420
ello which is deeply for SMTP and Mail

106
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,450
stuff we want to be able to reply with

107
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,850
220 senses Internet or GCM TP postfix or

108
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,000
exome and why is this useful because if

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,150
a vulnerability pops out for a new piece

110
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,610
of software or anything we can emulate

111
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,560
that software super super fast because

112
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,150
we just need to deploy a response and

113
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,120
all of our honeypot start immediately

114
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,470
answering correctly to the payloads that

115
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,130
are being sent

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,579
again we deploy our honey pots worldwide

117
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,010
every time a new data center pops up AWS

118
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,900
GCP every time we have a friend that

119
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,570
says hey I have an ipv4 and I don't mind

120
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,340
hosting one of your raspberry pies with

121
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,000
on my home we have scripts and automated

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,620
the entire thing that we can deploy all

123
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,150
of our honey pots worldwide this is our

124
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,220
currently data center deployments and

125
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
they're fairly well widespread and we're

126
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,370
adding more and more every month as I

127
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,050
mentioned every time a new data center

128
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,240
pops up we just run a script that

129
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,190
deploys on those regions for example

130
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,170
these were the last ones Microsoft Azure

131
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,380
opened in Switzerland AWS in Spain and

132
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,200
Ezer then open again in Norway and for

133
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,940
us was literally like just typing one

134
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,740
command in the command line and we get a

135
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,080
honeypot spun up and feeding our main

136
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,770
platform instantly so I'll pass over to

137
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,820
Florentine was going to talk a little

138
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,140
bit about architecture and some

139
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,680
decisions we made there now for the

140
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,900
architecture we try to keep things

141
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,919
simple but also fairly dynamic and

142
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,280
scalable so we have all these machines

143
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,560
that we call sensors there are really

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,270
lightweight machines that the only thing

145
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,300
that do is receive those events receive

146
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,220
those attempts of scanning those

147
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,410
machines then send that data to sync

148
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,850
that sense that data to our data

149
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,870
processing infrastructure our Kafka is

150
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,240
our main repository of events and then

151
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
we use storm cluster to process the

152
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,270
events and the processing we do here is

153
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,120
that tagging that Thiago mentioned and

154
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,560
we also reach the data with ASN our DNS

155
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,550
and some other stuff that we find

156
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,030
necessary then we import this data to

157
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,360
our database and if you were to go to

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,250
our website right now our free binary

159
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,830
edge portal you could see the sensor

160
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,490
data that we the sinkhole data that we

161
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,770
have been receiving depends

162
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:35,229
that's pretty much it so when you look

163
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,210
at an event this is pretty much what it

164
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,889
looks like and I'm gonna go from top to

165
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:39,460
bottom

166
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,470
client ID is just an internal ID that we

167
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,539
use it from a sinkhole the time stamp

168
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,699
every single event that we create or

169
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,259
that we receive has a timestamp

170
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,710
associated with it the IP on origin is

171
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,180
the machine that tried to connect to our

172
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,370
honeypot the type of the event again

173
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,389
it's something that we use internally

174
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,449
ASN they send up the IP belongs to and

175
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,340
then there's the data part we generate

176
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,909
an ash - for every single payload we

177
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,830
actually have a copy of the entire

178
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,509
payload and we generate extra metadata

179
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,560
regarding some payloads and we'll go

180
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,419
over what this extra metadata allows you

181
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:15,819
to then we have the tags associated so

182
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,770
we can see that this guy was doing an

183
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,319
SSL scan of some sort and we have the

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,210
target so the honeypot that he targeted

185
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,819
on our side as of today we have 266 tags

186
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,039
and this is super useful to try and

187
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,080
really understand what an IP address is

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,060
doing because we need to understand that

189
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,830
not everyone on the Internet is

190
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,930
malicious not everyone on the Internet

191
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,479
is benign maybe some of you freaked out

192
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,219
a little bit when you see binary ads

193
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,469
hitting your IP addresses all the people

194
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:46,000
love it because they get to log into our

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,500
platform and understand their exposure

196
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,250
without having to pay a lot of money so

197
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,620
we try to classify and add as many tags

198
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,580
as possible to our events this is done

199
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,430
by having configurations deployed on

200
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,440
these different files also let me give

201
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,030
just a quick explanation Iago said we

202
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,190
tried to have a simple way of

203
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,639
configuring things so these files these

204
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,130
JSON files they follow a simple

205
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,569
structure like Iago showed before and we

206
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,150
we can do tags on pretty much everything

207
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,539
we want we tag based on on earth ASN

208
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,969
based on HTTP requests based on

209
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,990
fingerprints such as ga3 or aj SSH

210
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,770
our DNS and then we have general tags

211
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,979
that it's basically by tagging on the

212
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:47,760
payload itself for for instance this is

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,740
one of the texts that we have for an SMB

214
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,339
scanner we look at the payload in itself

215
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,890
and we look for certain markers that we

216
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,870
know if the payload contains this then

217
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,339
probably it will be an SMB scan and like

218
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,260
this one we have lots of other ones and

219
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,260
basically this is our own DSL our

220
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,130
domain-specific language - to tag all

221
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,440
these events and it's as flexible as we

222
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,660
want if we want to add new functions to

223
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,180
this to make it more complex we can

224
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,200
because it's custom made one of the

225
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,520
important things this binary edge on

226
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,290
each side has to version of the platform

227
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,970
we have the Enterprise version which is

228
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,320
for enterprise clients we signed

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,970
contracts we do the entire shebang and

230
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,000
we have the free version which we took

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,529
as a community you can come in you can

232
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,700
use it for free if you want some extra

233
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,680
credits put your credit card but you can

234
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,020
also contribute and get credits for that

235
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,940
and we actually have a person that

236
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,520
contributed 92 new tags in the space of

237
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,020
about a month and a half and we actually

238
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,790
ended up hiring him is sitting front row

239
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,200
is running binary edge in January

240
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Phillipe and we have other people in the

241
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,920
community that do this as well because

242
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,200
they are trying to use the sensor data

243
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,329
for themselves and they end up in

244
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,279
reaching our own data with their

245
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,140
knowledge so we have to make something

246
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,790
that was super super simple to write

247
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,529
instead of having them write actual

248
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,160
proper code but you know you might be

249
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,980
asking why and if you've worked in a

250
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,640
sock you might have maybe an idea of why

251
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,380
it's useful to have this stuff so

252
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,910
internet scanning has come a long way

253
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,829
I'm sure like if I ask if you know show

254
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,930
then 90% in the audience would raise

255
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,610
their hands right but these days is not

256
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,350
just show than anymore there's us their

257
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,329
senses besides their own scanning

258
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,790
Roberts Graham as an individual created

259
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,380
masks and does their own scanning as

260
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,220
well

261
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,880
there's Umayyad metrics rapid7 and of

262
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,959
course this generates a lot of noise if

263
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,120
you're like listening to your perimeter

264
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
if you're monitoring

265
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,790
the firewall it really makes a lot of

266
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,640
noise and to prove my point I'm actually

267
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:00,340
going to connect to our real-time am I

268
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:07,960
going to connect baby oh yeah first just

269
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:15,790
a second you know new laptop and things

270
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:23,830
fail so this is actually our sinkhole

271
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,570
Stream in real time this is the stuff

272
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,820
that's hitting our honey pots and as you

273
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,220
can see like trying to identify all of

274
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,670
these things is a pain and if you are an

275
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,010
ISP or if you have a lot of assets

276
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,750
exposed to the Internet you're getting

277
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,430
just as much traffic as we are and if

278
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,590
you're monitoring an IDs or a firewall

279
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,570
you're gonna see lots and lots of these

280
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,970
so it's super useful to have something

281
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,100
that enriches that tells you what those

282
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,230
things are why because it allows you to

283
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,790
prioritize and going back to our

284
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,550
presentation if we can find it Google

285
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:06,640
sheets never again really really

286
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:14,820
disappeared Jesus let's try this again

287
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,790
so in a hundred time there we go so if

288
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,950
you work for a sock or not this should

289
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,110
be familiar to you like an IDs throwing

290
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,240
a bunch of warnings but what if we could

291
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,460
have an enriched version of that that

292
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,930
means you could reduce your sock

293
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,120
exhaustion like you don't need to focus

294
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,670
on 90% of the events why because this

295
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,860
will be typically general scanners that

296
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,260
are scanning the entire internet and are

297
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,030
not focusing on you and you should

298
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,620
actually enrich your service bit with

299
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,780
binary edge or grey noise for example

300
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,210
maybe you heard of them I'm technology

301
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,500
agnostic even though I own one of the

302
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,050
companies but use whatever you want but

303
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,880
essentially it reduces the exhaustion of

304
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,130
the people working at the NOC or at the

305
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,380
sword because they only need to focus on

306
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,329
things that are specific to their

307
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,860
instead of looking at things that are

308
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,509
heating the entire world of course this

309
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:07,179
also allows us to detect funny things so

310
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,179
we found these numbers to be quite high

311
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,369
like there's a Russian ASN and if you

312
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,739
can see that on top as well that Russian

313
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,839
is the top country's scanning and what

314
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,439
are they scanning for RDP scanner and

315
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,779
this gives you a bunch of ideas in a

316
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:23,920
couple of different things and we'll go

317
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,629
over those as well but we also detect it

318
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:29,949
down there version 1.16 - version on the

319
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:32,319
HTTP pads and we actually explored what

320
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:36,160
this was and we did a bunch of changes

321
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,929
that a lot is - goal will be deeper on

322
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,089
this of course we also find fresh

323
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,339
malware on the honey pots and you can

324
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,429
also monitor your IP addresses so if you

325
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,379
see one of the IP addresses that you own

326
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,689
talking to one of our honey pots in the

327
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,879
platform you have some issues unless you

328
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,379
run a scraper or you do your own

329
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,119
internet wide scanning you're probably

330
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,559
infected with something or you've

331
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,239
probably been pawned and it's something

332
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,269
you should keep an eye on I'll just pass

333
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:02,439
over to Florentino is going to talk a

334
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,059
little bit about some of the problems we

335
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,589
ran into when building our own custom

336
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:11,499
honey pots now for the case of UDP it's

337
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,079
fairly simple you can just open a socket

338
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,610
and listen because there is no

339
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,449
connection

340
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,439
there's no complication there so

341
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:22,660
basically what we do here is we create a

342
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,239
socket and then we used some firewall

343
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:29,949
configurations to redirect everything to

344
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,290
the port that we have the socket open

345
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,470
you could also create a rough socket and

346
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,629
just listen to everything but there's

347
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,519
too much nice terry and you definitely

348
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,309
want to filter out some ports now for

349
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:44,619
the case of TCP it's much more complex

350
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:48,639
because you you will have to have

351
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,949
something binding to the port if you

352
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:54,040
want to receive stuff so we needed to

353
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,189
create a version of this that create

354
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,769
that built the connection the full TCP

355
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,220
handshake and another version that used

356
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,850
the raw socket to

357
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,240
all the TCP scenes and this is needed

358
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,870
because nowadays port scanning is mostly

359
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,050
based on since scan it doesn't finish

360
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,940
the connection so you need to catch both

361
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,860
things but then you also need to catch

362
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,990
the SSL connection so you need to

363
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,390
complete not only the TCP connection but

364
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,640
also the SSL handshake can catch

365
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,320
whatever is beneath all that so there

366
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,839
it's fairly complex you have to and you

367
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,760
need several several sockets open and

368
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,290
again we did this also using some

369
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,540
firewall rules so we open one part and

370
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,950
we're activating to that so one thing

371
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,250
that comes to mind many times is why not

372
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,290
use just something like TCP dump or

373
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,730
Wireshark and the thing is in itself

374
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,620
it's not enough it's useless because you

375
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,080
do need to have something underneath

376
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,660
that completes the connection so that's

377
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,990
why we thought of building this all

378
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,740
custom-made and the good part is that

379
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,709
because of this we also we can

380
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,480
manipulate whatever we want and when

381
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,700
when you had the question can we respond

382
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,660
to these requests anyway we want it was

383
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,670
easy because it was our code we just

384
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,160
needed to insert some packets in the

385
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,839
middle and it's that another problem

386
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,440
that it's it's one it's probably the

387
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,649
biggest problem we have so far is the

388
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,860
volume of stuff why when those Russian

389
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,220
guys start scanning for RDP like once a

390
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,110
month it's really the the worst part for

391
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,829
our our infrastructure because the the

392
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:03,110
density of data that comes per second is

393
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,480
really high so we need to have a really

394
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,380
big poster to add all of that and it's

395
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,109
it's funny let's just say this so now

396
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,669
that we have infrastructure in place I

397
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,839
mentioned for example

398
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,990
malware and with malware we can do lots

399
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,490
of different things we have importers

400
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,109
that can enrich data with things like

401
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,199
virustotal and Iran Joe cloud or even

402
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,029
from binary edge itself so for example

403
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,890
if we want to see if the people scanning

404
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,279
for RDP had the RDP port open itself we

405
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,380
can enrich our honeypot either with our

406
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,279
scanning data as well we started finding

407
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,080
a couple of interesting things so for

408
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,029
example we get things like this that get

409
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,919
tagged as malign you see that there's a

410
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,890
double you get in there with the URL and

411
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,289
then you check and it's just malware in

412
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,990
there of course and as I mentioned

413
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,270
before we have metadata that we generate

414
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,190
and you generate two types of metadata

415
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,039
right now ga3 and aj ssh and you might

416
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,559
see them here and what are these two

417
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,559
things and why are they useful so g3 is

418
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,110
essentially a signature on the ssl

419
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,899
connection that the clients that are

420
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,610
connecting to our honey pots are using

421
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,500
and it generates fingerprints this is

422
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,330
not new this was invented by the team at

423
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,789
salesforce and we add it to every single

424
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,399
ssl connection that we receive on the

425
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,039
honeypot side you can see here the

426
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,409
explanation they generate CSS LG a3

427
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:28,850
which is the version cipher

428
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,700
extensionality curve in the point format

429
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,130
and then the digest is the md5 of all

430
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,149
these things concatenated aj ssh it

431
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,039
essentially uses the unencrypted part of

432
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,010
an ssh connection concatenates all the

433
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,690
algorithms and then generates the md5

434
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,980
which generates the aj ssh signature and

435
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,539
this allows us to do two types of things

436
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,390
number one actor clustering so IP

437
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,880
addresses that belong to the same actor

438
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,710
because it generates a signature for the

439
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,350
tool that that actor is using and it

440
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,230
also allows us to find common tooling so

441
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,779
how many people are using the same tool

442
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,210
to scan for SSL how many people are

443
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,820
using the same tool to scan for SSH and

444
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,610
if you have an actor that you know tries

445
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,500
to hide from our honey pots from our

446
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,600
tagging system by changing IP address as

447
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,100
well they also need to change the

448
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,659
signatures on their tooling because we

449
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,059
catch them that way with this we can

450
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,100
generate an image like that and you can

451
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,230
see that there are a bunch of clusters

452
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,110
by combining the ASN information in our

453
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,600
tagging system we can enrich this image

454
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,519
this way so we can see that there's a

455
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,529
cluster for binary edge there's a

456
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:38,809
cluster for each side one costs are for

457
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,220
Sheldon in senses because they use

458
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,080
similar tooling and this is specifically

459
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,350
for SSL scanning there's a large cluster

460
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,990
of IPS from Iran in China that they're

461
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,909
using similar type of tooling as well

462
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,409
and this is kind of interesting

463
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,909
knowledge because you can really start

464
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,409
to identify like when they're trying to

465
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,809
hide so if an actor all of a sudden

466
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,279
decides that they don't have the reverse

467
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,230
DNS or rotates all of their IP addresses

468
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,389
we can still catch them on the signature

469
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:06,380
of the tooling same thing for sha SSH

470
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,389
but what this this tells us is that

471
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,120
there is a lot less tooling being used

472
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,970
to scan for SSH because you see lot less

473
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,320
clusters that you saw with TLS and then

474
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,809
you start seeing weird things so on our

475
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,740
honey pots we started seeing Accenture a

476
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,139
SNR IPS from the Accenture a SN's

477
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,380
starting to scan or do TCP scenes on our

478
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,720
honey pots anyone has a clue why this

479
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,059
happened so essentially they were

480
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,299
spoofing the IPS from Accenture you see

481
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,559
this typically when someone's trying to

482
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,570
draw the blame at some other provider

483
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,490
and how do we know that this is proofing

484
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,019
because poofing has a very typical

485
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:50,330
signature you only see TCP scenes

486
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,830
because they never complete the

487
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,289
handshake and you see very direct very

488
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,659
small spikes because they rotate trying

489
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,769
to emulate who they're trying to spoof

490
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,590
we also saw the same thing happened to a

491
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,570
bank centrist Bank

492
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,840
they had the same issue and then you

493
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,909
start seeing even weirder stuff so we

494
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:12,529
started getting a bunch of SSH

495
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,510
connections and if you guys look at the

496
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,960
our DNS Navy gov dot us and were like

497
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,019
okay that's really weird because in this

498
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,210
case he wasn't just TCP since like the

499
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,130
connection was actually happening and we

500
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,860
were getting like two packets so what

501
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,570
was happening there and what happened

502
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,980
there is that this IP address actually

503
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,640
belongs to

504
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,950
provider called frantic which doesn't

505
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,960
verify the reverse DNS on their end and

506
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,670
someone just set up the reverse DNS to

507
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,860
pretend to be Navy Gulf and they never

508
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,520
did a confirmation on that same thing so

509
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,980
HTTP paths we monitor HDTV paths and we

510
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,320
started seeing a very large spike on v1

511
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,560
16 version and what's happening there we

512
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,670
started to see that we were not

513
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,770
emulating the correct response because

514
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,050
we would only get the initial HTTP

515
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,690
requests so we took a look we noticed

516
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,280
that it was a request for the docker API

517
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,320
and all Florentino did was literally

518
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,320
commit these to a repo and then we

519
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,940
started seeing the entire connection

520
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,700
like actually dropping malware they have

521
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,190
a curl up there and essentially it

522
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,230
deploys a container that starts to mind

523
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,450
for Manero the cool thing is because the

524
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,220
way our system is developed when we

525
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,200
detect certain strings all of these

526
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
automatically got tagged as malign and

527
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,220
malicious we didn't have to do any

528
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,670
changes for that and this is just some

529
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,470
of the stuff that was inside the the

530
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,800
malware that was deployed and you can

531
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,410
see that it's essentially a Manero minor

532
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,050
[Music]

533
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,520
you start seeing things happening in the

534
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,710
real world reflect on your sensors as

535
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,620
well so the Dutch police took down a

536
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,210
fairly large DDoS botnet provider and we

537
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,830
saw a reflection of these on our sensors

538
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,330
as well so if you look at the date here

539
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,240
October the second immediately on our

540
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,430
sensor data because we knew the IP range

541
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,660
because we're working with some people

542
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,490
that were helping on this we saw an

543
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,650
immediate drop of any events coming from

544
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,070
them

545
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,390
so that's how you see that you know

546
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,650
what's happening in the news is actually

547
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,690
effective who knows what this is any

548
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,490
ideas

549
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,690
cv 2019 zero seven zero right blue key

550
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,340
publish date zero five 14 2019 and we

551
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,410
started seeing that lovely Russian Laius

552
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,510
and a couple of days later doing

553
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,310
something very very interesting we call

554
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,470
it an inventory scan they were not

555
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,390
exploiting blue keep but they are

556
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,640
checking every single opinion in the

557
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
internet on every single port if they

558
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,920
are exposing RDP or not at some point

559
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,720
they might trigger exploitation but

560
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,950
they're essentially looking at the sea

561
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,909
five thousand five hundred and thirty

562
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:47,490
five ports of every single IP on the

563
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,799
internet if it's exposing RDP or not

564
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,529
constantly in this generates a very very

565
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:57,269
large volume of data and you can see

566
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,760
that we went from having zero to huge

567
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,789
amounts and this has it's still going on

568
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:05,070
by the way if you can like Bend this on

569
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,409
your edge this ASN do it you'll be doing

570
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,010
yourself a favor you also find things

571
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,720
that are really cool so there was a

572
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,159
vulnerability that came out for

573
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,690
confluence on the 12th of April and

574
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,730
immediately two days after we started

575
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,899
catching an IP address exploiting that

576
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,980
and this is actually really cool because

577
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,679
it's super interesting to measure from a

578
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,600
vulnerability when it gets announced to

579
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,370
how soon we start to see it getting

580
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,110
exploited and of course because we get

581
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,240
to see the full payload lots of times we

582
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,679
can see what sort of malware is being

583
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,309
deployed

584
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:39,779
what type of exploitation they're

585
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,820
actually doing all of that so what are

586
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,760
some of the things that we want to work

587
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,510
in the future

588
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,250
fitting the binary edge use case what we

589
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,889
do is if you give us an organisation

590
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:58,139
name we need to figure out IP addresses

591
00:24:58,139 --> 00:24:59,909
and domain that belong to that company

592
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,590
and then we need to figure out what

593
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,230
they're exposed or what they're involved

594
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,940
in as well so we'll have a system in our

595
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,620
sensors in our honey pots that consumes

596
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,659
all of these events and looks for

597
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,820
anomalies we call it snuggle-butt and

598
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,649
you can see here that it looks four

599
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,450
different things it looks for spikes in

600
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,389
IP addresses it looks for as you can see

601
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:24,389
here you know spikes in countries ports

602
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,639
that are being targeted certain payloads

603
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:28,529
certain HTTP paths because you can give

604
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,960
us an idea of is there something new

605
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,480
being exploited yes or no

606
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,970
who is exploiting it are we seeing math

607
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,590
scan for something new that we haven't

608
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,080
seen before is this a new actor yes or

609
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,970
no and we have an entire automated

610
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,340
system that gives us this anomaly but

611
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,139
these are still very raw events what

612
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:47,279
we're working on right now is

613
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,940
essentially the anomalies becoming

614
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,400
stories and a story is essentially the

615
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,380
beginning of an anomaly the end of an

616
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,320
anomaly and all the tags that enrich

617
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,750
that tell that story of that event and

618
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,030
the IPS that have participated in that

619
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,170
event because that's super useful

620
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,780
because if you find one of your IP is

621
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,700
talking to our honey pots you're gonna

622
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,770
immediately gonna be able to search when

623
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,600
they were scanning the honey pots what

624
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,850
they were scanning it for essentially

625
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,230
instead of having to go through the raw

626
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,600
data we do the enrichment for you and

627
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,160
you don't have to have all that extra

628
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,840
work and we're also working on something

629
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,120
we call the internet scanning hitos and

630
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,260
the reason for this is because we're

631
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,770
starting to see a lot more malign and

632
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,390
non benign and these are two different

633
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,110
things

634
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,500
actors showing up and what we've decided

635
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,570
is that from now on we're setting a

636
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,670
bunch of rules to ourselves and to our

637
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,890
peers that scan the internet if you're

638
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,240
scanning the internet you need to have

639
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,950
reverse dns set up on all your scanning

640
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,990
IPs you need to send non-malicious

641
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,870
payloads Buras posting via some type of

642
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,240
communication methods respect a

643
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,520
blacklist and data removal and actually

644
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,470
do throttling if people ask you to

645
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,110
because we do all this and we don't want

646
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,150
to break the internet we're not here to

647
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,560
hack organizations are not here to do

648
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
anything of that and we expect the same

649
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,210
type of behavior from our peers in the

650
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,210
industry and what happens is if our

651
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,270
sensors catch an actor that is failing

652
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,550
at one of these we will immediately tag

653
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,370
you as malign and you might ask why do I

654
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:18,880
give a

655
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,770
reason for that is very simple we're

656
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,690
gonna start offering black lists for

657
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,880
free to every organization that wants it

658
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,980
you want to load a list of malign IP

659
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,080
addresses at your edge we're gonna give

660
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,790
you a list for that for free load it up

661
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,500
in your firewall load it up in your IDs

662
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,570
start blocking those guys because

663
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,670
they're not behaving so you need to put

664
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,760
a stop to that and we're hoping more

665
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,230
organizations start consuming these

666
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,760
black lists and start blocking people

667
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,960
that don't know how to behave and that

668
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,280
are not helping you secure your

669
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,960
organization's because that's the

670
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,700
objective of our internet scanning if

671
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,590
you want to try and play with our data

672
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,290
app binary X dot IO promo code besides

673
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,410
this one 2019 we'll give you six months

674
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,730
for free not actually free you'll have

675
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,070
to pay one euro but that's because

676
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,840
card provider doesn't allow us to do for

677
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,890
free because they need their own money

678
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,370
but it will be one euro nominal fee and

679
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,230
you can play with all of the data this

680
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,970
will give you full access scanning data

681
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,530
data leaks domains sensors all of it the

682
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,720
only thing that we asked back feedback

683
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,400
if there's something you think we can

684
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,350
improve if there's a tag that you can

685
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,480
provide us we appreciate it because it

686
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,940
helps everyone else any questions

687
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,760
Thank You Thiago we have hello good

688
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,980
afternoon I have a question regarding

689
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,890
the black lists if someone gets on the

690
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,560
black list how can they remove

691
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,490
themselves from it

692
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,650
sure so one of the bigger problems of

693
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,930
black lists these days is that they have

694
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,580
no time measurements you jump into one

695
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,950
you're gonna sit there for a month and

696
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,630
if that's if it's a nice black list

697
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,270
provider with us you jump on our slack

698
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,890
channel or talk to us on Twitter and we

699
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,030
will remove you from the black list

700
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,470
assuming that you're following details

701
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:15,740
of course okay thank you anyone else yes

702
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,990
sorry so what platform did you do the

703
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,360
any pot in we wrote something fully

704
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,530
custom done in Python tree I think I've

705
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:35,510
seen it no it really something

706
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,600
hi I'm giving any experience regarding

707
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,990
the black listing and blocking that is B

708
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,820
level so we we find that it's a

709
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,310
marketing thing if I'm honest so we used

710
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,940
to be super in the dark no one knew as

711
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,920
like four years ago and we would get a

712
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,830
blacklist a lot it was hard but now that

713
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,300
our name is more out there you know we

714
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,220
appear on TechCrunch because we have to

715
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,110
beat the PDL League for example last

716
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,150
week like revealing it and helping the

717
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,580
FBI with that so the more we find that

718
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,350
the more our name gets out there the

719
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,360
less we're getting people asking us to

720
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,410
block them and they're actually starting

721
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,480
to work with us so it's unfortunately

722
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,220
very much an image and marketing thing

723
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,070
still you talk to the ISPs you show them

724
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,390
what you have they start using your

725
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,730
platform and they don't ask you to block

726
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:41,880
them anyone discounts for to just

727
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,010
another the question since the data gets

728
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,670
so large so fast are you keeping the

729
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,370
data for how long

730
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,550
so we archive every single thing that we

731
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,220
scan or listen to we keep everything

732
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,090
available by API for six months

733
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,070
everything on the portal for one month

734
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,170
by a UI okay thank you anyone else

735
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:13,150
oh there's one on that you want a shout

736
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,680
it's a sprint between you're in there

737
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,710
thank you so then which come kind of

738
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,300
database are using for storing the data

739
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,650
because if you are

740
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,840
yeah storing it for six months then a

741
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,290
lot of data so storage goes into s3 like

742
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,760
after he gets out of the six months

743
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,640
range the six months storage I believe

744
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,430
he's on a Cassandra cluster and our

745
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,380
normal storage would be sitting on an

746
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,320
elastic search okay thank you

747
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,960
Thanks and the reason for that it's

748
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,730
because it's the stack we were familiar

749
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,010
with on our scanning site so we just

750
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,180
tried to keep with tools that we're

751
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,760
familiar with and we like we have the

752
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,140
entire system working in less than a

753
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,850
month from like development to having

754
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,350
something functional month-and-a-half

755
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:06,920
made sunlight anyone well if you have

756
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,480

757
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,100
chat with us I'm gonna be here for a

758
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,540
little bit and thank you very much

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,690

760
