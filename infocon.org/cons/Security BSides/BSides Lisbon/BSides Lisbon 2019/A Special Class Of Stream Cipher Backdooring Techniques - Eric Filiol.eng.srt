1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,509
remaining so cryptography is always a

2
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:15,249
difficult topic but I would like to

3
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:19,119
present a very hidden issue about back

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,119
door and we'll explain at the end way it

5
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,759
is a very concerning topic because a lot

6
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,880
more nation state try to weaken

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,730
cryptography and speak more and more of

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,520
backdoors and we will see one

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,510
application of Victorian techniques in

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,270
what I call wiki strong key systems so I

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,890
probably spoke of this agenda if I'm

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,289
going to present one more algorithm

13
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,140
which contained a back door which comes

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,539
from original research but based on the

15
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:59,760
analysis of non non case of backdoor in

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,590
military equipment sold to different

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,438
nation-state and everything has been

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,369
revealed in 1995 and now it should be

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,990
should be now so just for you to

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,299
understand where I come from I was from

21
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,479
a military cryptanalyst so I saw a lot

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,610
of different crypto machine and most of

23
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,750
them sold to government contain more or

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,880
less backdoors

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,479
so I study for many for many years the

26
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,149
concept of backdoor I'm still doing it

27
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,640
and I try to not to promote backdoor you

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,100
are not mistaken but just two to one

29
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,070
that it is possible so let us first to

30
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,740
explain the context you must be aware of

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,750
the fact that still nowadays it is

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,079
selling cryptography is very strictly

33
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,409
control at the international level so

34
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,770
you are formally it--i

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,030
and now you have the person our

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,310
agreement and you should read the sooner

37
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,540
agreement because in the list for B they

38
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,860
say if you are not allowed to sell

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,569
symmetric cryptography whiskey size

40
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:28,989
exceed 64 bits 64 bits so read the

41
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,390
vasana argument and the vassal argument

42
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,099
in fact refer to weapons and dual-use

43
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,319
technology a control it means that

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,080
quickly cryptography and cryptographic

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,580
algorithm are considered as weapon so

46
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,060
how to control first you can consider

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,549
implementation backdoors and we have

48
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,170
plenty of examples since the Snowden

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,829
leaks but slightly before and now we

50
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,549
know that most nation state USA of

51
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,590
course but China probably and Russian

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,599
Russia as well try to control

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,920
cryptography in a way or another and of

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,829
course the environment operating systems

55
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:20,950
protocols the way to code the

56
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,940
cryptographic API everything is

57
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,220
interesting in order to enforce and to

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,950
input implementation vectors the program

59
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,090
that if the backdoor that implementation

60
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,940
level the attackers can find them and of

61
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,630
course exploit them the most difficult

62
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,350
level is underneath and to consider

63
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,230
mathematical backdoors directly at the

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,500
mathematical description or design of

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,829
the algorithm once again there are a lot

66
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,030
of

67
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,150
not a lot if you example variable you

68
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,180
can refer to the case a Swiss company

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,300
was selling crypto machine for

70
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,580
government the governmental needs to

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,030
nollie 130 countries and the world

72
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,600
organization of course Switzerland is a

73
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,988
neutral country a cheese and chocolate

74
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,940
but in 1995 it has been revealed that

75
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,610
most of these crypto machine web backed

76
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,210
by the NSA it means that during only 50

77
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,820
years the USA were controlling all the

78
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,520
encrypted traffic so nearly 130

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
countries literally diplomatic a

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,600
commercial and so on most more recently

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,720
you have probably heard about the key

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,450
generator sold by the Earth's I company

83
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,000
and sudden as revealed that when they

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,640
say pay 10 million dollars in adult in

85
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,700
order to weaken twin truth backdoors in

86
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,700
the protocol by choosing careful

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,900
constant in the do a dual addict observe

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,140
random number generator so there are

89
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,870
extra there are only very few open

90
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,240
research in this area it is clear from

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,060
indirect information that NSA and

92
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,760
English from GCHQ are working on this

93
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,450
list of this probably was a China and

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,030
many other countries depending on their

95
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,120
mathematical skills so the big question

96
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,979
the key question is can we trust for any

97
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,990
encryption algorithm it should be a

98
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,330
national issue

99
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,010
most of the encryption algorithm we use

100
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,430
are not selective are chosen by all

101
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,970
countries so once again my research is

102
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,630
those to promote backdoor in encryption

103
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,940
systems it quite the contrary

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,290
but you must be aware of the fact that

105
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,090
detecting backdoors is is quite an

106
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,470
impossible

107
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,640
you have doubly exponential complexity

108
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,610
so I have chosen from a near the reverse

109
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,560
approach just to prove that it is

110
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,800
possible to embed web and today I will

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,290
consider the case of string cipher

112
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,990
stream ciphers in fact more and more we

113
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,630
use AES block ciphers in and so on but

114
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,300
stream cipher did not disappear at all

115
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,000
in fact they are still widely used in

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,550
international communication in telecom

117
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,810
Asian standards for value are 3gb PE or

118
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,750
you have European system tetra we still

119
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,590
use stream cipher unconvinced with the

120
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,890
rise of IOT stream cipher will be more

121
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,150
and more used for minimi region in which

122
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,690
I will present a few of them in the

123
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,790
Philip military cryptology or government

124
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,390
Akrotiri contrary to what we may expect

125
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,300
in fact they are still widely used

126
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,260
because they offer better mathematical

127
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,740
truth the security both at the

128
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,950
implementation level but also at the

129
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,180
operational management of the encryption

130
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,310
system and of course industry

131
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,180
illumination the main problem that most

132
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,430
of the time they are embedded in system

133
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,640
they are proprietary and we don't know

134
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,410
the design the one among the most recent

135
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,560
recent example was equipped to one knife

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,360
fare algorithm was being extracted by

137
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,060
the customer in starbug from the

138
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,990
solution and it was weak once it has

139
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,180
been revealed the algorithm as proven to

140
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,419
be which suits are very interesting book

141
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,790
if you consider the implementation in

142
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,130
terms of logic gates they are less

143
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,500
expensive easier to implement out go

144
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,120
faster so the didn't disappear

145
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,820
Puritan what about the previous world

146
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,830
back door so they're only very very few

147
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,150
the first part in fact you have Gerald

148
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,590
backdooring take it as a mathematical

149
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,630
level but also pop up schemes have been

150
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,600
broken or were too weak to be to be used

151
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,380
and on a practical basis two years ago

152
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,279
for the first time with published AES

153
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,210
like algorithm with 128 bit of key and

154
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,360
the algorithm is fully public he's fully

155
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,390
compatible to all the cryptographic

156
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,250
requirement internal security but there

157
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,310
is a algebraic and community backdoors

158
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,600
and we are able to break it in naughty

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,620
seconds with only 300 kilobyte of data

160
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,750
so for block ciphers were proven that it

161
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,270
was possible of course we have chosen

162
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,300
one technique among possible other ones

163
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,029
but it is possible on strict strength

164
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,800
cipher backdooring since it was more

165
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,320
related to liquid material world there

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,820
are only they are not very there are not

167
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,529
a lot of studies maybe the crypto when

168
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,930
my fir case is the only one I have in in

169
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,060
mind what is important when you buy

170
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,690
cryptographic algorithm you try to input

171
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,560
a lot of data and to evaluate the

172
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,390
statistical properties it is what the

173
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,850
client can do so the first requirement

174
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,120
that from a statistical point of view

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,370
must be compliant with all this as a

176
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,690
standard regarding crypto basic so last

177
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,630
year we published the first string

178
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,070
cipher

179
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,959
no Lee it was 128 bits of key and right

180
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,380
here is a different parameter you need

181
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,040
to to break it but can we go further and

182
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,860
design more sophisticated back dogs so

183
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,240
what the difference the main difference

184
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,970
between block ciphers and stream ciphers

185
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,130
is very important to keep this in mind

186
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,100
[Music]

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,720
once again from a mathematical point of

188
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,339
view and of course industry point of

189
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,430
view stream SIA are very simple very we

190
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,860
have large Cerreta call corporate about

191
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,519
the different primitives as well as the

192
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,730
industry implementation stream cipher

193
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,740
are used for nearly 70 years it for

194
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,600
block ciphers it's gnarly

195
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,079
40 years so there is a big difference

196
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,610
they have a pro community community or

197
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,949
complexity means that the set of all the

198
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:06,350
different possible internal states are

199
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,959
far more limited that in block sizes so

200
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,269
it's very difficult to ID

201
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,910
backdoor at least seemingly so most of

202
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,120
the design require the algorithm to be

203
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,029
non public and contrary to block cipher

204
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,260
most of them are effectively if you

205
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,510
consider block ciphers there are more

206
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,649
complex the number of internal States is

207
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,920
so huge yet you can even you cannot even

208
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,089
describe them so you are it is a

209
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,880
combinatorial nightmare so the other

210
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,240
question is and we gave recently an

211
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,569
answer is it possible to I something it

212
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:54,500
is possible to analyze exhaustively the

213
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,010
real answer is of course yes and you can

214
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,319
publish the algorithm without revealing

215
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,480
the backdoor your job to make sure that

216
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,300
it will won't be possible to extract it

217
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,480
so after having presented the context I

218
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,100
would like for us to describe the

219
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,310
algorithm I am

220
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,820
design just to illustrate special class

221
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,730
a special regarding terrorism but the

222
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,400
way to attack it so it is a stronger

223
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,670
variant of the algorithm published last

224
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,430
year so very classical design you are

225
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,020
for linear feedback shift register yeah

226
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,740
with initial content is a secret key you

227
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,870
have a combining a boolean function

228
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,050
which is modified at the key set up by

229
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,080
part of the secret which it produces a

230
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,839
random sequence which is combined by

231
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,290
soul bitwise so to the plaintext so once

232
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,640
again very classical design used in many

233
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,820
many systems so the key is 128-bit so it

234
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,570
is a master key you can of course add

235
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,120
session key if you want but very

236
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,580
important in the communal combination

237
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,770
function is modified by the keys so

238
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,950
there are as many algorithm are the

239
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,430
artists which isn't which is seemingly

240
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,430
very interesting because it makes all

241
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,620
existing cryptanalysis techniques very

242
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,630
diesel or not to say impossible to apply

243
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,460
in fact it is not the case so you have

244
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,589
the multi mode with a feedback feedback

245
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,810
polynomial there are very dense what

246
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,880
this you expect you use and you have the

247
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,800
initial value which is from a

248
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,600
cryptography point of view a good value

249
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,060
[Music]

250
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,339
so the algorithm is very simple very

251
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,430
classic a classical once again and you

252
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,790
just from the key setup you modify you

253
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,610
initialize a convening function you

254
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,560
modify it with your function and then

255
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,260
you can quit and in the fact that you

256
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,640
saw

257
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,589
the output of the first region is just

258
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,110
to improve as much as possible the

259
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,459
statistical properties

260
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:33,269
well once again very classical it is

261
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:35,519
just a general scheme you can do a lot

262
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,709
of things this design was deeply used

263
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:44,130
during the 80s and the 90s encryption in

264
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,760
the world it is probably still the case

265
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,709
[Music]

266
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,720
you can change the feedback polynomials

267
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,209
boolean function you can do a lot of

268
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:58,010
parents so the plenty plenty of possible

269
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,620
algorithm variants which makes this

270
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,529
general design very interesting and can

271
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,120
be extended to many many different cases

272
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,610
in fact this scheme of course as a back

273
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,329
door we are going to see why but when I

274
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,630
compare my algorithm to previous

275
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,700
algorithm well there are some

276
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,800
similarities because of course I will in

277
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,079
pile inspired by it what I have seen in

278
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,670
my personal life the main differences

279
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,690
that I just extend the parameters in the

280
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,670
80s 90s secret key was about 64 80 bit

281
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,310
now of course it will be too short so I

282
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,649
have just extended the design in order

283
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:48,269
to would say modern key size so 128 is

284
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,949
in the minimum of course breaking 64

285
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:56,100
bits algorithm will be rather easy now

286
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,589
with present-day

287
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:05,220
computing resources so if we look at the

288
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,990
algorithm from the kryptonite's point of

289
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,820
view you want to evaluate the algorithm

290
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,940
is there any weakness no all the

291
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,339
feedback column all our primitives we

292
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,360
are co-prime is degree is prime so

293
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,130
everything everything is perfect

294
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,380
[Music]

295
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,730
compared to

296
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,950
web expects the theory but theory is

297
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,310
only theory of course the main things

298
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,500
you have to do is to be sure that the

299
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,980
statistical property is nearly perfect

300
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,970
you cannot predict the future you know

301
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,990
you cannot go backwards to the past and

302
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,890
everything must be perfect

303
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,160
so the algorithm has been evaluated

304
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,730
using the US National Institute of

305
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,960
Standards and Technology

306
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,140
it means that when you want to design a

307
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,140
system you are first to prove that it is

308
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:04,180
FIPS 140 row compliant in fact this

309
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,650
standard is a set of statistical tool

310
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,170
and you have to prove that your system

311
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,829
is a perfect from this respect my

312
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,349
algorithm is totally perfect of course

313
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,930
are also standards from the academic

314
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,050
world of the industry world the to order

315
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,690
standard artist you I and die harder

316
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,000
with respect to all these three eversion

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,610
tool for the statistical property

318
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,820
well ESA to is perfect of course it is a

319
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,220
fish it is necessary condition but not

320
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,050
sufficient condition that's why when

321
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,100
when you have a commercial ad saying

322
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,130
okay we are FIPS 140 row compliant well

323
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,190
it doesn't mean that it is indeed very

324
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,450
strong so now we have described the

325
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,180
algorithm let the CEO to break it I'm

326
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,160
sorry it is necessary to do a little

327
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
math but you can bypass and go wait for

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,140
the final result so first I have to

329
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,720
explain that when you want to break an

330
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,100
algorithm result ESA won a BAC - it is

331
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,140
precisely the reason way of design this

332
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,180
algorithm just to illustrate

333
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,150
that way you can perform cryptanalysis

334
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,920
somehow different from the general

335
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,010
perception of the academic world in the

336
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,290
academic world they try to find one

337
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,290
general algorithm to break all possible

338
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,190
keys that's beautiful that very

339
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,400
stimulating to the spirit but sometimes

340
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,830
it's quite impossible

341
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,270
and here it's particularly impossible

342
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,330
generally if you want to do real-life

343
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,300
crypt analysis you are going to divide

344
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,809
your program in the polynomial con table

345
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,080
a finite number of seven instance easily

346
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,910
each instance is weak so you have not

347
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,080
only one cryptanalysis program but a

348
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,500
given number with parallel computation

349
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,860
is not a problem nowadays so in this

350
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,130
case we just consider the 256 possible

351
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,350
value that modified the boolean function

352
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,710
as a particular instance so we have to

353
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,670
run 256 programs in power that's not a

354
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,309
problem when you are big company or an

355
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,700
intelligence service the other

356
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,090
difference when you work in military

357
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,840
world

358
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,120
we don't exceed you don't expect to

359
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,840
break all the traffic but at least for

360
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,450
example you are able to break let's say

361
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,090
10% 20% of a traffic it's a big result

362
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,960
it was 10% of 20% of the diplomatic

363
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,480
traffic you can learn very very much so

364
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,679
once again operational people accept not

365
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,620
to be able to do break everything but

366
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,809
the significant part of everything

367
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,330
surely academics are considering known

368
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,249
plaintext cryptography cryptanalysis

369
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,179
what it's very surprising sometimes they

370
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,700
support that they know a huge amount of

371
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,450
plaintext in the in this case what do

372
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,710
they need to do Krypton is real life to

373
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,669
change this you have only access to the

374
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,529
ciphertext it is the only thing that you

375
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,070
can why of that or its drops so in this

376
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,230
case I will explain to you how to work

377
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:06,830
only with ciphertext so these are the

378
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,499
side with the maths so in fact when you

379
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,179
have a boolean function you try to

380
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,489
measure the correlation between the

381
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:17,239
input and up the basic idea is to find

382
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:20,480
correlation that can enable to get rid

383
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,149
of of the of the boolean function just

384
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,179
to have linear equations so for that we

385
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,190
use a mathematical tool called world's

386
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,539
transform so you compute in fact the

387
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,840
correlation between a selection of input

388
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,049
with the function and when you have the

389
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,239
value of the correlation you are able to

390
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,399
compute the probability that the input

391
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:47,509
is equal to the output it's more simple

392
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:52,960
that you that the materialization make 0

393
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,389
so for each possible selection of input

394
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,999
you are what we call the spectrum it

395
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,340
means the different correction values

396
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,759
and what is in very important the number

397
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,330
of one in the mask selection map of the

398
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,059
input describes the number of register

399
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,669
the input register you have to break

400
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,590
through an exhaustive search and of

401
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,019
course we try to at the lowest possible

402
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:26,570
weight of the different masks so in ok

403
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,340
we are in for when we modify the boolean

404
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,509
function in fact we get different award

405
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:38,010
spectrum in this case for example

406
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,080
whether if I modified with exact value

407
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,620
d9 I get the reason this resulting

408
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,960
function and you have here the world

409
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,929
spectrum when you have zero it's not a

410
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,700
good news because you have strongest

411
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,260
value the average value being for what

412
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,030
does it mean from a practical point of

413
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,220
view it means that you have a very

414
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,679
strong correlation between the input and

415
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,840
output when you have aid it means 75%

416
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,620
which is huge and well 462 0.62 profit

417
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,690
which is also huge so until now since we

418
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,850
are able to approximate the boolean

419
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,040
function with linear equation you can

420
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,380
write your output as a linear

421
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,200
combination of your beauty

422
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,110
yes it will be too simple because we

423
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,090
have another issue to deal with see we

424
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,790
work with ciphertext cryptanalysis we do

425
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,049
not we do we know about the size of the

426
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,410
plaintext but from a new person point of

427
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,130
view you can get some main statistical

428
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,650
parameter for example when you were on

429
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,020
European traffic a Western traffic you

430
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,640
know that it will be most of the time

431
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,080
ASCII coding or ccitt - if you go

432
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,780
through a satellite you know the

433
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,150
including and you know at least encoding

434
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,600
is a linguistic group and you can we

435
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,460
have different tables it is an

436
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,309
impossible to guess a general parameter

437
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:20,160
which is probability for plain texts or

438
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,770
plain text bit to be equal to 0 that's

439
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,040
enough we don't need anything and of

440
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,620
course we at least or Arabic languages

441
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,910
as ethic languages and very conservative

442
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,770
value is a 45

443
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,910
percent for a plaintext bit to be

444
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,630
continued

445
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:46,679
that's enough so in fact we have just to

446
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,440
include this additional noise coming

447
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,990
from the plaintext to or correction

448
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,550
value you have here's a general equation

449
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,700
it means that at the end we have a

450
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,120
resulting total correlation of the 52%

451
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,760
of the 51 person which is once again

452
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,150
very good when you perform crypt

453
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,179
analysis so we get rid of the plaintext

454
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:12,820
we are now able to work only on the

455
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:19,929
cipher toast a last issue that we know

456
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:24,070
that we saw to the output sequence which

457
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,330
saw the output of the first reducer so

458
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,580
it means that we have when we try to

459
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,220
break the register one by one we have to

460
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,290
systematically include the first

461
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,809
register which is part of the backdoor

462
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,090
just to make things a little bit more

463
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,800
complicated complicated that it says so

464
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,650
in fact you just are going to attack

465
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,200
register couple of register by Coppola

466
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,610
receptor for register and retrieve the

467
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,770
key to Koresh classical correction

468
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,140
attack is not a problem so if you

469
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,309
remember the key size 128 so normally

470
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:05,170
you could expect ready to do an

471
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,460
exhaustive search 2 to the power 128 but

472
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,910
in this case you have a Koopman an

473
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,160
attack complexity which is ranging from

474
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,470
2 to the power 39 to 2 to the power 91

475
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:25,059
and you just need 6 kilobyte 6 kilobyte

476
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:31,020
bit 6 kilo bits sorry of ciphertext so

477
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,470
you always you can always add this

478
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,880
amount of ciphertext no problem

479
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,090
so here you have the summary of the

480
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,370
different case so and remember I will

481
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,220
speak at the end of the class so the

482
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,400
biggest class about 60% of the keys you

483
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,530
can break hit with a very strong

484
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,590
correlation

485
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,620
low complexity to to the poor so Tina it

486
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,760
means that breaking a 60% of the cases

487
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,530
is easy to to supersalty 9 is nowadays

488
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,070
very easy and you have the other classes

489
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,990
and of course this class in this class

490
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,460
C's 3 and 3/4 are becomes difficult even

491
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,180
nowadays being able to break 2 to the

492
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,630
power 91 is still difficult I don't say

493
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,940
I don't know whether the NSA or a

494
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,430
Chinese eyeball but still consider as

495
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,690
very difficult to reach not to say

496
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,350
impossible but until here it is

497
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:48,370
considered to be tractable so you have a

498
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,040
general description of the attacker

499
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,800
rhythm he just for one given register

500
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
and of course you apply it to the

501
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,480
different register you want to you want

502
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,700
Ricky to be referred of course it is

503
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,880
abdicating you just keep the best score

504
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,400
but if you want to do soft decoding you

505
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,840
say okay I will

506
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,970
for example keep I would say ten or

507
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,640
twenty or fifty or hundred best keys

508
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,980
based on today and then to fill a it's

509
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,890
very easy and it is not very

510
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,820
time-consuming

511
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,460
so you can of relax your decision

512
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,690
and optimize your probability of success

513
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,830
so now we have seen that in fact this

514
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,929
algorithm contrary to the to the

515
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:48,919
appearances is weak but from a general

516
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,470
point of view it seems to be strong now

517
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:57,710
how to you that remember that more and

518
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,419
more were speaking about control of

519
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,919
cryptography for example let us take the

520
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,679
case of NATO NATO you have 27 countries

521
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,020
and as far as I know until late a nine

522
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,559
90s early 2000 in fact all the

523
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,260
encryption algorithm used by the Aryans

524
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,850
were provided by the USA USA as well as

525
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,610
the keys it was for interrupting

526
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,659
interoperability issues and of course

527
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,820
security remember control of come to

528
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:42,740
work until late 90s the different

529
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,700
countries of the Alliance had no access

530
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,770
to the encryption algorithm description

531
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,399
the problem is okay you provide a very

532
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,559
strong algorithm for your military needs

533
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,230
but one controller to say Portugal of

534
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,360
France decide maybe to use this

535
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,919
algorithm in less control way across

536
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,289
Italy when you give crypto you give a

537
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:09,860
weapon

538
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,090
remember the Vasa Narwhal so how to

539
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,950
manage this are to make sure that even

540
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,710
you don't play the rules that you will

541
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,279
be still able to control it is what I

542
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,860
call the strong key with these crypto

543
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,899
systems in fact depending on the class

544
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:33,440
of the key you you are the algorithm

545
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,460
will be more or less strong just imagine

546
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,740
in more than all contact for example ice

547
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,239
P provider whatever you want

548
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:46,989
that a client decide not to follow the

549
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:51,279
words and to use their the provided

550
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,159
algorithm in a different way that

551
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,769
phrasing 0 condition of huge specified

552
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:02,769
space 5 we want to respect those so the

553
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:05,019
basic idea behind this kind of algorithm

554
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:08,679
which say ok is going to use the the

555
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,129
client is going to use is a letís but

556
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:15,879
with I probability the keys will weaken

557
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:18,580
the algorithm so I will be able to write

558
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,789
the algorithm not less in the case of

559
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:29,200
BSA true in fact you see that 60% of the

560
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,229
trees will fall in the c0 class it means

561
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:35,139
that you will be able to break 60% of

562
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:37,839
the traffic with the complexity around 2

563
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,830
to the power 39 and if you want to

564
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,099
provide strong security when you when

565
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,499
the client play the game play the game

566
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,179
and respect the rules

567
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:54,009
in fact keys are provided by from the

568
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,859
c-4 class the most difficult class to

569
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:01,299
break of course you have a lot of

570
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,089
possible scenario to imagine it is just

571
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,279
a general scheme just to make you aware

572
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:15,719
of this kind of subtleties so auto-tuned

573
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:20,349
in fact and all the news I am going to

574
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:27,099
show you comes from the 10 last days the

575
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:32,739
VI recurrently one to one that the IT

576
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:34,629
industry implement backdoors in

577
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:39,099
encryption its nightmare is end-to-end

578
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,759
encryption

579
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:46,570
this is Department from the US but also

580
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,490
from the European you

581
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,490
and community tries irregularly speak

582
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,090
about

583
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:57,730
well let us enforce back doors and try

584
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,390
to push laws in order to enable this

585
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,660
weakening mechanism so it's very

586
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,790
concerning because we cannot on one side

587
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,730
as to protect the industry to protect to

588
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,950
protect a citizen and to enable them to

589
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,230
be protected and on the other side to

590
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,770
say okay

591
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,530
trust us we are going to control

592
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:22,120
everything and it's not possible to so

593
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,070
more recently it was a few days ago they

594
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,030
decide we are of course a lot of good

595
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,150
argument to protection run or take

596
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,240
everything we want but in fact they want

597
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:44,559
to weaken the encrypted security and of

598
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,920
course you have a sub G escrowing so you

599
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,520
are able to use your crypto but you have

600
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,290
to give to give me your key for example

601
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,630
Microsoft as you you can include but you

602
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,960
have to provide to accept the escrow

603
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,090
mean or the other solution is back

604
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,590
though that's so the last interval in

605
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,050
Europe and in work a police organization

606
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,100
we are a strong which is striding also

607
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,500
to input back tones so I am convinced we

608
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,230
need a lot of research in this area it's

609
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,000
very important to prove that it is

610
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,770
probable and to be aware of the fact

611
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,219
that more and more this issue will be

612
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,480
wearing issue I don't think it's this

613
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,918
argument to protect yourself by

614
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,879
weakening crypto is a good argument it

615
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,780
is a fast a wrong argument so of course

616
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,880
our lot of work

617
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,460
to do so for example were working on

618
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,620
different crypto committee for stream

619
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,719
ciphers nonlinear feedback shift

620
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,350
register or using memory on apology

621
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,900
Brutus algorithm is a stream cipher with

622
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,600
easy row with memory memory bits and we

623
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,990
are going to try to extend the idea of

624
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,300
wiki strong key cryptosystem to block

625
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,240
ciphers working at the key scheduling

626
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,210
algorithm sonali by mid-january all the

627
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,090
technical details and the complete

628
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:22,900
description of the algorithm to attack

629
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,040
the stream cipher will be available so

630
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,510
thank you very much it's having a

631
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,660
question

632
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,140
yes but what the second we have a

633
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:51,420
question over there thank you for your

634
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,230
talk

635
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,990
quick question that you mention about

636
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,420
how not using a closed source

637
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,540
cryptography and how open source

638
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,300
cryptography is better and some

639
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,180
advantages but I'm remembering so I want

640
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,120
to ask about France is France nowadays

641
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:15,360
more defending that posture and be

642
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,500
against key regulation or key scheduling

643
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,270
a bad one like because in practice like

644
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,370
sharing your key schedules is not a good

645
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,370
idea because you know in the 90s France

646
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,620
would forbid strong SSL and so on and so

647
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,180
as how as your opinion because you know

648
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,700
the context has been shipped in that

649
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,440
mentality or is that still that

650
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,720
mentality oh we load the key we load the

651
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,840
cipher we don't think about it anymore

652
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,640
no you write the position of France was

653
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,390
always well strange first just to

654
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,990
remember until 2004 the cryptography was

655
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,900
limited to 64-bit not to say I think

656
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,350
even 40 which was of course totally

657
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,640
stupid I'm from France but I was among I

658
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,350
was matteri at the time as I know it's

659
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,740
totally stupid it's not possible but

660
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,940
even in France and the former interim

661
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,520
Minister organic as nerve we stopped at

662
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,220
the major in Germany tried as well to

663
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,200
say we have to break to input backdoors

664
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,910
it is totally stupid because bad guys

665
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,100
the most better the baddest guy are not

666
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,250
using cryptography if you see our

667
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,750
Italian mafia is working they don't use

668
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,030
smartphone and so on so breaking

669
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,800
cryptography which really is not a

670
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,020
solution there is a strong need for

671
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,450
citizens for industry to protect the

672
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,460
traffic

673
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,000
now I convey that we must add a fully

674
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,700
open cryptography but it is a necessary

675
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,369
condition it comes from the 19th slow

676
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,780
from kak off that say we must know the

677
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,119
algorithm the security must not rely on

678
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,430
the secret of our algorithm only of the

679
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,150
scatter of the key but the aim of this

680
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,099
research it to say ok necessary

681
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,920
condition not a sufficient one but

682
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,910
you're right

683
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,660
I'm very concerning and concerned about

684
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,160
the France is the country who wrote the

685
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,920
the right of human as a human right so I

686
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,230
think we have a moral responsibility to

687
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,530
defend strong cryptography but it's true

688
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,020
that in Europe and in France is a very

689
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,300
easy solution for police forces easily

690
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,849
ok we are not very strong so you will

691
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,119
make sure that the citizen will be weak

692
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,790
well it's a very strange position but

693
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,640
you're right and we are to be very

694
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,300
careful very cautious and to monitor the

695
00:38:47,300 --> 00:39:04,970
monitor any more question in your strong

696
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,520
key wiki scenario how can the provider

697
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,670
test which keys are strong and which are

698
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,710
weak and how can't like in your example

699
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,089
the countries that were using that

700
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,880
crypto do the same thing to tell apart

701
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,950
which keys are weak and which ones are

702
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,549
strong in fact when you design your if

703
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:28,490
you intend to design such a shame

704
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,270
social scheme sorry in fact you will of

705
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,549
course may the prior analysis in order

706
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:37,940
to be able to to identify and select the

707
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,000
key which in this scenario we suppose

708
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,520
form NATO so the United States but the

709
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,190
provider

710
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,490
we'll add this either knowledge of

711
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,849
course it is everything is prepared and

712
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:55,150
define specified during the algorithm

713
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:08,170
design and test I believe hello thanks

714
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,690
for your talk I have a question

715
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,650
regarding for example SSH keys in the

716
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,220
beginning you talk about elliptic curves

717
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,619
so my question is regarding that so when

718
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:27,250
we are creating a keeper for SSH for

719
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,710
example what's your advice should we use

720
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,930
elliptic curve keys or RSA keys what's

721
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,049
your opinion on that so it's strong

722
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:41,259
debate in fact all girl algorithm are

723
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:45,269
good in the case of the

724
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:48,549
ECC RPG which is a random generator

725
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:51,880
based on elliptic curves the problem was

726
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,619
not elected curves it was the choice of

727
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:02,470
some constant some particular value when

728
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,119
those value has been chosen as a

729
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,519
standard remember it was the ISO and

730
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,000
NIST standard some cryptographic

731
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,700
researchers say oh we are not trusted

732
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,490
that those concerns very much but no one

733
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:20,769
wanted to hear them in 2014 if I

734
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:25,420
remember Snowden say ok the NSA paid 10

735
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,750
million dollars in order to make sure

736
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,539
that the week constant will be chosen so

737
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:34,690
once again it is not a race is probably

738
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,759
weak if if you consider quant the

739
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:38,410
quantum computers but from a

740
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,150
mathematical point of view with good

741
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,509
parameters or req typical cryptography

742
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,539
the very good algorithm but what is

743
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,640
important to evaluate the different

744
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,360
parameters so

745
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,360
I would say let's tres open research the

746
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,270
open crypto community they are very very

747
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:03,900
active and trying to detect any attempt

748
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,820
to modify or to weaken but once again

749
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,350
mathematics is a very difficult area so

750
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,990
we have everything must be open and I

751
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,910
think it is very necessary to have a

752
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,360
very huge open and lively research but

753
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,180
once again I would not say one is better

754
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,760
than the other it depends on your

755
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,920
operational constraint for example a

756
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,290
thicker product provides with a quite

757
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:32,010
same level of security smaller keys so

758
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,930
for implementation of traffic purpose is

759
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,660
better than RSA where you have very long

760
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,030
keys okay thanks

761
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,230
any more question

762
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,630
[Music]

763
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,330
No thank you Eric for your talk we will

764
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,540
proceed
