1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,450
thank you it reminds me when I saw the

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,110
100 bitcoins for 500 euros story

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,260
welcome to hiking with hardware I'm so

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,300
glad to be here at decides again it's a

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,189
wonderful venue full of wonderful people

6
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:24,310
so you already introduced me my name is

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,609
Pedro Moreno currently I'm the senior

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,999
security researcher at check marks but I

9
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,480
also do a lot of stuff on my spare time

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,640
sometimes I write for hecka day I

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,270
haven't written for for some some months

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:40,480
now

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,460
I don't have the time but I'm here as a

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,879
hardware hobbyist and I'm going to talk

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,449
about hacking with hardware so it's not

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,579
going to be about hacking hardware we

17
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,070
are not going to try and figure out how

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,230
to hack into your own router to change

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,170
the DNS settings or whatever I'm going

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,059
to talk about hardware that was built

21
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,129
with the purpose of hacking specific

22
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,060
hardware and why do I want to talk about

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,500
this I think other gadgets are are cool

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,810
if they are security related even better

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,530
I think in we all share like this common

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,400
imaginary of somewhere

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,080
some spies that have all these cool

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,240
gadgets that can open doors or make an

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,520
ATM speed money or whatever that alley

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
would kind of implanted on us

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,570
and we want to build this device is

32
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,630
somehow I also wanted to share my

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,280
experiences my my tips my my fails so if

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,810
you are starting now we don't have to

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,380
repeat my own mistakes and the objective

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,600
here is to try and bring more folks into

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,460
the hardware makers community that have

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,540
a security mindset I think the the

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,940
community the harder making movement

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,700
already have started to grow in the

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,290
security sense so to speak but there are

42
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,890
space for for for more folks to come and

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,119
have fun building cool stuff before III

44
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,700
do to talk about what I was doing what I

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,380
am doing at the moment I want to talk a

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,280
bit of what is 3 so I want to talk about

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,320
historical devices that were built

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,720
because that it was the only way to hack

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,060
into something ok and I want to start

50
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,459
with this guy

51
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,410
Marlin masculine it was a British

52
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,410
musician and inventor and it was

53
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,360
probably the first wireless hacker so

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,430
this guy was a self-taught radio

55
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,220
enthusiast he built his own radios and

56
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,620
antennas and it was getting really

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,420
professional because some of the

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,700
antennas were like reaching 50 meters

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,780
high this was in 1903 around around that

60
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,550
area in the beginning of the 19th

61
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,180
century and of the 20th century so it

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,820
was a public detector of Marconi Marconi

63
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,070
had a lot of patents about radio at the

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,640
time and I think he had a

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,090
a problem with that maybe you already

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,070
have a bit of hacker mentality and you

67
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,650
didn't like those patents so in a public

68
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,380
demonstration that Marconi did he

69
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,810
actually built the radio and he set up a

70
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,280
small radio next to the West End musical

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,690
where the demonstration was going to

72
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,840
happen and he hacked into the the

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
demonstration by sending a Morse code

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,530
message that was a very dirty poem some

75
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,480
people found it funny those who knew

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,720
Morse code it did it because he wanted

77
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,120
to bring the attention that Marconi was

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,310
saying that he invented the new method

79
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,820
to secure communications via wireless

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,580
via writing in this case and his idea

81
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,040
was that if an attacker does not know

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,110
the frequency in which the message was

83
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,930
being transmitted then he could not hear

84
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,120
the message so the youngest security was

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,520
the frequency for us now it's pretty

86
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,260
clear that that's not a measure of

87
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,510
security but please keep in mind it was

88
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,270
the early days of radio and in his mind

89
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,160
it was impossible to know which

90
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,120
frequency guy was transmitting moving

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,738
forward we got marian rejewski so it was

92
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,600
a Polish mathematician and cryptologists

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,150
that invented the bomba Cryptologic this

94
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,589
was a year of the World War two

95
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,689
it was presented with the problem that

96
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,759
the Germans were using an encryption

97
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,909
machine called enigma and they had no

98
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,899
way to decode that these messages so

99
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:42,749
Rochelle ski reverse engineer the

100
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,959
military enigma only with a commercial

101
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,959
version of that machine and some

102
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,749
encrypted messages so it was quite a

103
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,089
feat and then he built the bomba

104
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,969
Cryptologic which which was like six

105
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:59,819
enigma machines like glued together so

106
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,219
to speak and it could correct the German

107
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,389
codes at least at first then the Germans

108
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,669
changed something and it stopped working

109
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:11,909
and then Alan Turing built his own bomb

110
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,129
which was based on the Bromberg crypto

111
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,219
Logica it was designed just to to hack

112
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:20,579
into the Enigma codes there's too much

113
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,019
to say about cheering and his

114
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,669
contributions I don't think we all be

115
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,459
here maybe if it wasn't for its

116
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,419
contributions but then also William

117
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,579
Welshman made a contribution to the bomb

118
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,789
that made possible to decrypt the German

119
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:38,309
messages in a timely fashion so again a

120
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,469
hardware that was built for the purposes

121
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,899
of hacking in this case in the

122
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,379
cryptology field now moving on to the

123
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,749
50s I want to talk about doing gracia or

124
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,629
joy bubbles J bubbles was were born

125
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,539
blind and when he was four he discovered

126
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,599
the the telephones and he was really

127
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,119
into the telephones for a blanket maybe

128
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,769
there was not much to do at that time

129
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,259
and he discovered he could dial numbers

130
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,839
just by clicking the on and off button

131
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,239
on the phone and when when he was seven

132
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:15,029
when he was dialing a number he noticed

133
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,699
there was some tones he could hear and

134
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,099
he decided to whistle back those phones

135
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:24,299
and the call hanged up so I thought this

136
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,339
is funny something is happening turns

137
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,760
out that he had

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,800
2,600 Hertz pitch while it was whistling

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,040
and he could effectively make the

140
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,450
switchboard think that the call was

141
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,000
disconnected but continued to talk so

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,450
this is a way to have a free phone calls

143
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,550
and at the time the phone calls were

144
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,900
very expensive especially the

145
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,260
long-distance so this guy didn't

146
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,390
actually build anything any artwork I

147
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,490
think that he had the hardware building

148
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,830
it has a very nice story for those who

149
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,890
the other year I think everybody knows

150
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,820
about vocals maybe the younger don't but

151
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,740
this was the the beginning of a

152
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,830
revolution the sixties and seventies

153
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,840
gold Golden Age

154
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,920
so the freaker's back then which was the

155
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,370
phone hecklers there was a couple of

156
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,800
guys also blind that contacted the guy

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,140
called John Draper and saying look we

158
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,240
have a way to acting to the telephone

159
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,720
systems but we have to carry around or

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,820
whistles or we have tape recordings of

161
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,560
the 2600 Hertz tone and that takes too

162
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,600
much trouble if we had like some sort of

163
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,020
box where we can dial and that we have

164
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,420
we can generate the tones that will be

165
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,250
very cool so they contacted John Draper

166
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,560
also known as Captain Crunch and John

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,900
Draper had a electrical engineering

168
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,970
background and he built the first blue

169
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,090
box now the blue box was a tone

170
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,000
generator it could be used to tow out of

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,370
stuff including what joy bubbles first

172
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,850
discovered but then it from there a lot

173
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,400
of different boxes were made by

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,590
freaker's it was a very prolific time

175
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,860
building order into a racking systems

176
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,560
like the the red box would fool the

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
electronic

178
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,120
it would fool the the two services into

179
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,640
thinking that a coin was introduced at

180
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,490
the payphone the orange box would allow

181
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,130
you to change your caller ID so a lot of

182
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,440
boxes the blueprints were online shared

183
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,150
in BBS's and it was a very prolific time

184
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,760
for for hardware manufacturers in this

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,740
case flippers now in 1985 this guy

186
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,599
called the neck and that's when she

187
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,640
published a paper about electromagnetic

188
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,220
radiation from video display units from

189
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,070
monitors and not only he published the

190
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,890
paper as he built a device with it was

191
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,900
essentially a screen a decoder and an

192
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,420
antenna and it could point the antenna

193
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,540
to any screen and get the the what's on

194
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,240
that screen remotely without

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,070
interference it's also called tempest

196
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,890
freaking auto Tempest means specific

197
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,380
things in a security field but the

198
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,270
security community was very concerned

199
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,090
because that decoder could be built with

200
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,990
around 15 dollars of material so there's

201
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,240
also some videos online about the BBC

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,210
program that's that was made so this

203
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,280
this kind of vulnerability gained a lot

204
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,140
of media attention also like we see

205
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,400
nowadays with some vulnerabilities and

206
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,240
the guy came to be known by Vanek

207
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,050
radiation this kind of radiation later

208
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,370
in 98 Porco sure it was it was a

209
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,160
principal designer of deep crack whip

210
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,140
crack was essentially a machine built to

211
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,660
crack the DEA's challenges that are RSA

212
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,910
security made back in 1997 to

213
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,670
demonstrate that DES was broken was not

214
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,260
supposed to be used because it was no

215
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,830
longer safe

216
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,510
so des challenges to was the first one

217
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,210
that did crack participated and it was

218
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,800
solving 656 hours deep crack was made of

219
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,860
100 1856 ayzik chips like soldiered

220
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,590
together and it was the brain of deep

221
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,080
break so there are a lot of examples I'm

222
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,690
sure I'm very sure that some of them

223
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,730
that are important I didn't mention but

224
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,240
we have to fast forward in time to get

225
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,170
to we are today so several things were

226
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,930
happening somewhere along the way the

227
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,080
internet was born the community started

228
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,250
to grow in strength in switching

229
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,290
knowledge from the BBS's into the

230
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,840
internet which also the vendor started

231
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,630
to produce more accessible devices there

232
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,790
are a lot of microcontrollers now that

233
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,980
the obvious were using like basic stems

234
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,130
pitch AV ours g8 is the 8080 also so and

235
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,290
there was like a boom of websites that

236
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,810
facilitated access to all the parts or

237
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,090
to exotic parts that obvious could not

238
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,870
have access before and and then later on

239
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,540
Alibaba if the road for the Chinese

240
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,820
suppliers to flew the market with cheap

241
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,690
material or student cheap stuff so at

242
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,590
the same time hyperspace movements

243
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,960
mushroom in every major cities now it's

244
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,430
a common place everybody knows what an

245
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,000
anchor space is and they kind of

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,440
democratize the the access to this

247
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,350
knowledge into the community access and

248
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,020
sharing of knowledge the Arduino helped

249
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,720
to bring more students and later the

250
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,240
Raspberry Pi and nowadays we have the

251
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,000
ESP is that allows us to as an office to

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,730
put Wi-Fi almost in every project even

253
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,580
if it's a toaster and even if that makes

254
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,870
no sense

255
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,330
online PC playmakers are also an

256
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,790
important part for the Abhi's because

257
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,830
now it's easier than ever to send your

258
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,380
own PCB for fabrication at a price that

259
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,520
is not prohibited primitive and others

260
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,620
fabricator services like 20 bringing

261
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,990
services moved so now we are here today

262
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,120
and I think we live in privileged times

263
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,490
for the hardware of

264
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,910
okay I think it's it's very easy for us

265
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,480
as even if you're obvious even if you're

266
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
starting now in having liked soldier

267
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,649
anything you can start there are

268
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,830
communities everywhere the information

269
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,470
is abundant the parts are cheap easy to

270
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,459
find and especially starting kids exist

271
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,820
for most of microchips for example let's

272
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,190
say you find you find out that the

273
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,899
microchip has this particular function

274
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,910
that you want to use and in your project

275
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,310
back in the days you had to you know

276
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,270
read the older that datasheet and then

277
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,820
use all the circuitry involve the analog

278
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,890
circuitry involved to make that chip

279
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,800
work and nowadays it you can find that

280
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,080
in starting kids so you can test your

281
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,690
idea before you going deep into the the

282
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,700
analog part and in the soldiering part

283
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,279
which i think is something that scares

284
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,700
people that like most of us has have a

285
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,010
very strong software engineering

286
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,529
background but not so much in electrical

287
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,240
engineering so sometimes we are afraid

288
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,130
to start projects because we you know we

289
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,899
don't know where to put the resistor or

290
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,180
the condenser or whatever so the

291
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,360
starting kids are also helpful and I

292
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,140
think for all these reasons there was a

293
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,290
boom of hardware that was built just

294
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,020
with the security or maybe to test

295
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,529
security in in the last like five years

296
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,350
or so so I'm pretty sure you know most

297
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,570
of these devices like you know the

298
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,649
famous rubber ducky and proc smart and

299
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,230
packaged squirrel over there the USB

300
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,040
cooler which is will but anyway it's

301
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,810
it's hardware and it demonstrates a

302
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,529
security flaw or something

303
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,079
and you see there are more complicated

304
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,509
projects than others it doesn't stop

305
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,329
them from being useful I'm pretty sure

306
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,369
you also know this this little guy here

307
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:19,159
and on this corner it's not another

308
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,159
project per se but you know you grab a

309
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,079
board and you put a display and then you

310
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,539
have an entire community around around

311
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:34,189
this device which is quite funny so this

312
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,859
is where we are today and what I want to

313
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,799
talk about is my my harder build

314
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,099
approach I want to share it it's not

315
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,689
it's something that's pretty

316
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:47,719
straightforward I'm not saying it should

317
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,229
be adopted in any way your mileage may

318
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:53,899
vary but I think it's a good approach if

319
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,519
you're trying to start to build a

320
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,189
prototype not a product but a prototype

321
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,099
so you can test your own prototype and I

322
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,229
will place this presentation on a pet

323
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:08,349
project of mine that I started so

324
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:12,470
usually you have like I have seven

325
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,479
different phases like the first one

326
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,489
motivation is not really well it's a

327
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:19,879
phase of the project slow the idea has

328
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,889
to come from somewhere right there are

329
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,979
people that always that are keep getting

330
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,169
ideas oh it will be so cool if there was

331
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:30,470
a device to do this or to do that and or

332
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,409
then the motivation comes out of

333
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:36,949
necessity like I really needed a device

334
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,970
to do you know something after you have

335
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,639
that initial idea and that you want to

336
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,919
materialize as a prototype you have to

337
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,709
to go to the definition phase for me the

338
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,979
definition phase is like just to write

339
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:54,829
down what are the features that I want

340
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,889
in that in that particular device /

341
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,559
features and after I have my features I

342
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,329
go research for the components or the

343
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,029
parts that can help me implement those

344
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:08,449
features on an actual device and then I

345
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,489
go into the design I figure out all the

346
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,190
pieces connect together

347
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,100
and design the the schematics and then

348
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,620
the PCB and so far I you don't spend a

349
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,690
lot of money or almost no money and then

350
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,339
it starts the part that you actually

351
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,199
spend a little money which is sourcing

352
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,000
the parts finger up figuring out where

353
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,149
are you going to buy them from also the

354
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,209
the PCB if you are ordering the PCB if

355
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,670
you are making it yourself if you are

356
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,639
ordering assemble everything here has

357
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,120
different costs and and speed of course

358
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,439
and then there's the fabrication part if

359
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,819
you are doing some parts yourself

360
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:44,410
then the test then the look if you're

361
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,389
not happy with your device or you want

362
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,920
to add some features you go back to the

363
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,810
definition phasing and you loop it until

364
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,180
you are you are happy so I'm going to

365
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,180
talk about each of these topics using an

366
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,430
example of a hardware that I that I do

367
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,150
so making of who buried the other is

368
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,880
called kuba he'd like this has this idea

369
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,679
has been brewing on my head for for too

370
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,650
long this is part of the motivation and

371
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,169
there was a time that I actually needed

372
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,990
that hardware it would be nice to have

373
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,650
to head

374
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,390
so since necessity is the mother of

375
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,480
every invention as I decided I should

376
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,990
start you know building it so this is

377
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,809
your friend we bought a phone technician

378
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,080
that some of you know that was doing a

379
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
social engineering gig so my test was to

380
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
go inside a company's office which I had

381
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,789
no knowledge about the inside and I was

382
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:46,450
there to change the router for one of my

383
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,059
own which I had two days to to build

384
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,860
something today that's just a package

385
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,909
school inside the router so what

386
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,799
happened is since I was going inside the

387
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,559
building I didn't have knowledge of what

388
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,620
I was going to find I will carry I

389
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,990
carried a lot of different devices that

390
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,750
I could drop or replace or put in on a

391
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,880
computer and at some point I had like

392
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,740
the Robert

393
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,809
on my head on one hand and a Wi-Fi key

394
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,270
logger on the other and I was like this

395
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,860
makes no sense I have like two devices

396
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,179
and if I have like this one opportunity

397
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,710
only one opportunity to access the

398
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,600
computer I'm not going to insert the two

399
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,120
devices it makes sense that all these

400
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,429
features like if you have a bad USB

401
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:31,440
injection device and you have a key

402
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,140
logger and then you have Wi-Fi all these

403
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,039
features make sense in only one device

404
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,789
especially because if you have something

405
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,529
like the rubber ducky and you leave it

406
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,169
there it's a bit conspicuous I think

407
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,659
what you have if if you have something

408
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:50,370
connected to the keyboard maybe there's

409
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,020
a better chance for that to go and

410
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,799
notice please that was my reasoning and

411
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,610
that's why I actually started the the

412
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,529
project that and another reason that I

413
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,370
stayed there so over USB

414
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,010
man-in-the-middle device the idea is to

415
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,220
have an input and an output and to have

416
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,750
a brain that can mangle

417
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,880
the packets and do whatever he wants to

418
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,570
do but the initial application that I

419
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,789
found out was to be a Wi-Fi key logger

420
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,279
and injecting at the same time also

421
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,299
since we are plugging in a USB device it

422
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,380
can also you know mimic a mouse and

423
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,510
whatever heat devices that you can think

424
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,059
of if you do the firmware for that of

425
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,610
course so I searched the usual suspect

426
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,010
shop for this kind of harder I couldn't

427
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,630
find anything quite like it

428
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,029
I found similar things but I didn't

429
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,159
found a project that involved every

430
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,049
everything and I think this was the

431
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,860
final motivator to start this project

432
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,659
but this should not keep you from also

433
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,570
beginning a project of your own in my

434
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,640
opinion so as I said this is a an

435
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,500
approach toward towards building a

436
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,710
prototype not a product okay so I broke

437
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,510
down the project proportionalities I

438
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,330
search for existing parts that could

439
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,830
perform some of all the actions that

440
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,260
that I wanted of course if I found a

441
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,419
part that perform all the actions and

442
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,919
problems of I figure out how you connect

443
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,620
them and then you read the find

444
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,600
documentation and data sheet or manual

445
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,929
depending to make it work

446
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,210
so the functionalities here this is the

447
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,460
research part the functionality is the

448
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,529
key locking part the injection part in

449
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,450
the Wi-Fi part so we have three major

450
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,789
functionalities and for that for the

451
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,760
injection part I based on and we know in

452
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,190
our the device there's a that mega that

453
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,480
runs this device can do hid injection so

454
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,490
problem solved you can buy a lot of

455
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,399
those clones of beg USB clones like

456
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,260
rubber ducky clones for three but it's

457
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,899
not very expensive problem solve for the

458
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:04,919
Wi-Fi part as I use the esp8266

459
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,580
it's also cheap I've used it before it's

460
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,799
powerful than an Arduino that's why I

461
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,380
chose it to be the brains of the device

462
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,679
so also problem so for the keylogger

463
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,889
part I have not I haven't worked with

464
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:22,200
that before so I researched a bit I come

465
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,100
I came out with this max 34 22 21 chip

466
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,220
which has SPI I know that the espys

467
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,600
speak spi

468
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,200
so for me it was just a matter of

469
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,240
figuring out how can I make all these

470
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,210
components talk to each other also

471
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,240
wipers already exist for the next 3421

472
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,970
in the arduino ide which i could use to

473
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,490
program any device

474
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,720
DSP and their arduino so from there we

475
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,260
get to the design phase

476
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,049
my advice is if you're starting

477
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,580
something and you're not used to

478
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,429
electronic design automation software is

479
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,039
to try at least a couple of them and I'm

480
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,260
going to explain so I don't think they

481
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,250
are very user friendly opinions may vary

482
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,720
but I don't think they are very user

483
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
friendly and some some things that you

484
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,149
can do in in one particular ABA it's

485
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,630
harder to do in another and I think it's

486
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,840
useful for you to try like a small

487
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,049
project from start to finish until the

488
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,730
PCB is made in different EDS and elect

489
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,590
you're the one that you like and then

490
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,200
continue to use that it will save you a

491
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,580
lot of time and then in the design phase

492
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,200
I think it's important to choose your

493
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,090
parts wisely you have to know if you're

494
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,789
going to solder it yourself if you are

495
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,889
going to fabricate the PCB board

496
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:50,049
yourself are you going to order the PCB

497
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,600
all of these things influence how you

498
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,760
should choose the part because if you

499
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
are going to solder them it might not be

500
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,919
a good idea to order very small parts

501
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,450
and try to make the project very very

502
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,000
small at least for a prototype in my

503
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,169
opinion so I choose legal yeah I usually

504
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:12,190
fail to listen to my own advice but this

505
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,429
is the project it's essentially it's the

506
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,179
ESB connected to the max 3421 which is

507
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,059
USB OS which is the the the microchip

508
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,760
that actually receives when you plug in

509
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,019
a keyboard and since the data so on the

510
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,730
important part here as I was saying is

511
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,889
to know your package types and know the

512
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:36,250
smg's and keep it simple the simple you

513
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,320
are your I think it's it's common sense

514
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,019
the simple your project is the easier it

515
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,929
is to debug and easier it is for for the

516
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:45,970
EA software to find the correct routes

517
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,600
when you're designing the the PCB when I

518
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,570
say package type I refer to to the

519
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,399
mechanical specifications of the

520
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,139
microchips there are different package

521
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,600
types and each one

522
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,760
makes it easier or harder for you to

523
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,400
soldier them if you are sodium

524
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
shortening yourself so just to give you

525
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,810
an idea this is a list of package types

526
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,830
for different microchips and it goes on

527
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,040
so it depends if it's through-hole or

528
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,810
not it depends that the spacing between

529
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,940
the legs of the microchip does it have

530
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,700
legs if you have an electronic

531
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,730
background you are familiar with this

532
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,530
but if you're not sometimes it can be

533
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,810
confusing so for example about SMD sizes

534
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,100
SMD are the very small components on the

535
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,130
board sometimes it can get really really

536
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,640
annoying for example there are two coats

537
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,650
when you are ordering the metric code

538
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,410
and the imperial code and sometimes they

539
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,320
overlap which is really really annoying

540
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,380
if if you do not if you are not specific

541
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,660
enough when you're ordering or if your

542
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,040
supplier mixes mix it up because this is

543
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,750
the difference between if you order like

544
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,790
the zero six zero three imperial code

545
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,400
you get a part that is one point six

546
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,560
millimeters by zero point weight eight

547
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,320
millimeters but if someone switches the

548
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,390
order or you don't specify its imperial

549
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,830
code and you receive the metric code

550
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,390
then you have to soldier something that

551
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,640
is zero point three millimeters in size

552
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,250
and you are going to be able to do it by

553
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,940
hand okay so know your SMD sizes my

554
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,980
recommendation for me what I found out

555
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,200
that works better is to use the zero

556
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,260
eight zero five it has to buy one

557
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,980
millimeter

558
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,030
roughly and it's quite manages I mean

559
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,530
you need pliers but it's quite

560
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,180
manageable and you can replace the

561
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,480
components by hand if you really have to

562
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,100
some some folks go for a smaller size

563
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,620
that's okay if you if you are used to

564
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,680
you know - if you don't shake much from

565
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,170
me from your hands and you're used to

566
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,140
soldier but I think it's a good start

567
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,580
regarding package types I think it's the

568
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,870
same if you've had if it has

569
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,000
I wouldn't choose a packaging type that

570
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,460
has less than 0.5 millimeters between

571
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,279
the lights otherwise when you're

572
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,130
soldiering it it gets stuck a lot of a

573
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,450
lot of the times then you have to be

574
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,480
debugging sometimes it's you know you

575
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,190
short-circuit something that's very

576
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,230
small for you to see you have to go with

577
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,510
with magnifier and you end up losing a

578
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,700
lot of time and in the end if you are

579
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,440
doing a prototype maybe it's not so

580
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,779
important that you are doing it like one

581
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:32,389
centimeter bigger or or smaller

582
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:35,690
so after that you go to the PCB design

583
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,690
phase it is essentially a mapping of

584
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,380
your circuit schematics into the put the

585
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,230
proper layers of the PCB and the the

586
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,409
copper the copper wires so to speak the

587
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,059
copper traces so I used ego ego

588
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,730
it has a cool outer root function this

589
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,980
is what I recommend for if you are

590
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,950
choosing an EDA if it has out early it's

591
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,740
better for you but mainly what it does

592
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,279
is it translates this these connections

593
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,760
in the schematics to the proper copper

594
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,740
traces automatically and you don't have

595
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,830
to draw it by hand you can draw it by

596
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,840
hand if it's a small project but if it's

597
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,700
a big project it's it's really hard to

598
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,710
do everything by hand so if you're

599
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,889
starting yeah choose one that has outer

600
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:31,610
route and the Ottoman function for me

601
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,419
ego was enough for this project so this

602
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,019
is kind of kind of why I chose it

603
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,059
did I mention to double check the thing

604
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,580
before before going into production if

605
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,130
not please double check after after the

606
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,260
design phase is done please double check

607
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,139
if you don't you end up with problems

608
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:54,950
like this where I switch the data - and

609
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,559
data plus and

610
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,270
in the first in the first version and

611
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,030
then I fabricated I don't know 50 words

612
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,100
and then they came and nothing worked

613
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,679
and then I realized I switched just to

614
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,299
couple traces in the end I did I did the

615
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,750
new device and I cut it I cut the traces

616
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,309
here with the knife and I solder some

617
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,960
wires so I could spend some time

618
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,150
programming while while the others were

619
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,429
making and and I wouldn't lose a lot of

620
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:29,940
time so then you got right now after the

621
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,000
design of schematics maybe you don't

622
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,409
spend a lot of money and now we are

623
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,809
going to source the parts I'm not here

624
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,059
to promote any vendors but I can give

625
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,190
you tips after if you want just make

626
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,590
sure you choose your your PCB

627
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,120
manufacturer and you have to know if you

628
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,179
have if you want to make a lot of a lot

629
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,929
of words or because it changes between

630
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:58,200
the course changes if you are doing a

631
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,630
lot of words of course some something

632
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,789
else have special prices for prototypes

633
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:04,470
there aren't a lot but there are already

634
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,419
vendors that you can say ok this is a

635
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,059
prototype build me just like 10 boards

636
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,220
and the prices would be would be very

637
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,850
accessible some some vendors received

638
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,010
the list of parts and they assemble it

639
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,770
all so you don't have to end soldier

640
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,960
nothing this is usually more expensive

641
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,350
solution at least if you're doing a very

642
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,610
limited batch and if you if you're like

643
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,610
doing some I avoid sensitive circuitry

644
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,400
you should go for high-quality PCB

645
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,679
manufacturers usually the Americans are

646
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,460
good and also the Germans so my

647
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,960
experience is that the most cost

648
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,860
effective way is to order the PCB and

649
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,940
order the parts separate

650
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,000
separately and then you soldier yourself

651
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,890
because it's not it's really not not

652
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:59,100
that hard so when you order your board

653
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,169
if you're choosing that pet or the

654
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:02,030
distance

655
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,610
this vessel is this metal intelligent

656
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,130
here that helps you position the soldier

657
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,100
at the right spots in your board because

658
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,690
then the soldiering test becomes easier

659
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,170
if you use a hot-air gun instead of the

660
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,950
traditional iron to soldier it's it's

661
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,780
not very difficult it's you don't need

662
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,300
like I take expensive expensive you just

663
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,250
need to practice a bit there are some

664
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,750
kits available that you can buy to

665
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,570
practice very small stuff soldiering

666
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,000
without you damaging your own boards if

667
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,390
you want like that's the hot air gun

668
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,420
that I use it costs like 15 euros it's

669
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,780
very very cheap it's gas-powered because

670
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,330
I travel a lot and I like to drive it

671
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,200
with me

672
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,630
so it doesn't have temperature control

673
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,510
or nothing but it's manageable and you

674
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,950
can use it in your projects you don't

675
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,840
have to spend a lot of money and my two

676
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,960
favorite methods to soldier is the

677
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,510
direct soldier method and author soldier

678
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,520
I had some videos I'm not sure if time

679
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,740
but if you have I will show you the both

680
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,810
methods

681
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,600
so after always then you get to the

682
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,850
testing phase if everything works its

683
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,070
tested if not at the first time then you

684
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,160
have to go test yourself so I don't I

685
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,680
need to use nothing fancy that's

686
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,020
standard multimeter the only thing that

687
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,960
I like in a multimeter is that it has an

688
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,370
audible function for continued

689
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,800
continuity testing so I don't have to be

690
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,720
looking at the multimeter and the things

691
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,130
that I'm testing if I'm testing for

692
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,200
continuity there's some kind of puzzle

693
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,990
that indicates me let's say some time if

694
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,060
you have budget getting off spacio scope

695
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,800
this this one is DF 2 or 3 it's like a

696
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,100
portable oscilloscope it goes around for

697
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,830
150 it's a bit expensive and it's not

698
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,440
really super necessary and sometimes if

699
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,760
you have a lot of ink

700
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,080
weighted circuits it helps to have a

701
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,800
thermometer because I've burned myself

702
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,510
so many times so it helps you identify

703
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,210
which which integrated circuits are

704
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,420
overheating or not and you don't have to

705
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,360
either your finger so essentially the

706
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,390
testing part is you review the PCB and

707
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,860
the schematics you figure out if the

708
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,610
relationship are properly well done you

709
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,320
analyze the board to see if everything

710
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,770
is properly soldered and if not you just

711
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,850
start to test each connection so it's a

712
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,670
net really iterative process so this was

713
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,360
kind of the loop cycle this this three

714
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,550
here were the first components that I

715
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,890
separated by functionality so this was

716
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,690
the arduino leonardo part this was a ESP

717
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,020
board with Wi-Fi and this this is a

718
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,340
starting kit for the mix so i just

719
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,020
connected a bunch of wires too many

720
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,440
wires actually and tested if my idea was

721
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,120
valid or not if i could make something

722
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,960
work as soon i wish i was sure that I

723
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,670
could make something work of our of

724
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,160
there then I designed the PCB the first

725
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,190
iteration which was flawed and then I

726
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,350
got to the second iteration and then I

727
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,870
got really excited and printed a 3d case

728
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,160
and it's stuff like that but do you not

729
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,400
have to do it so so this is kind of the

730
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,340
evolution of the art world process for

731
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,970
me it's it's very early stage in early

732
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,880
stage it's not done of course but it it

733
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,300
kind of works now so in the Hoover hit

734
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,830
prototype is an esp8266 by the USB key

735
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,680
logger that has keystrokes and mouse

736
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,740
injection and Wi-Fi capabilities so I

737
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,670
started the basic firmware development

738
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,730
there's like injection capabilities for

739
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,150
mouse and for keyboard but like some

740
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,880
features that I would like to see were

741
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,310
like the part that you you have the P

742
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,550
log management

743
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,970
password candidates like if the keyboard

744
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,040
is idle for too long probably the first

745
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,810
thing the user types is the password for

746
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,149
example injection payload the

747
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:16,679
functionalities management like import

748
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,449
pillows from other devices like the

749
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,399
rubber ducky we're not seems like a cool

750
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,610
feature in the Wi-Fi section you could

751
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,760
have like access point management Wi-Fi

752
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,120
scan to scan for nearby web access point

753
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,310
you can have a text like for example

754
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,850
let's say if you want to know the Wi-Fi

755
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,909
password right in a way that does not

756
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,370
interfere with the computer so to speak

757
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,500
so you can watch the authentication

758
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,370
detect to the computer that that whoever

759
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,639
it is connected to the if it's if you do

760
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,100
it times enough then the operating

761
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,679
system will require you to reenter the

762
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,560
password and then you get the Wi-Fi

763
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,410
password without even running code in

764
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,570
the computer or running a commenting to

765
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,460
write the password and then send it back

766
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,360
to you so I think the the features are

767
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,850
just your imagination is the limit to

768
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,650
the number of features that you can add

769
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,730
to this thing so I wanted to show a demo

770
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,090
but in fact I've been I was afraid that

771
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,680
the time was not enough so I've been

772
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,140
demoing this the whole time because I

773
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,260
have one disconnected to my computer and

774
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,540
this is the inner of the web interface

775
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,790
that's connected to the computer so I

776
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,620
can you know go back and forward I can

777
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,390
show you like the type o matic rate of

778
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:48,120
the thing here for example yeah so it

779
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,630
that's really really fast so it could be

780
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,460
faster but then it would be complicated

781
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,380
for the serial connection sometimes the

782
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,910
the keys could drop so also like running

783
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,780
commands

784
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,300
like opening a browser plus two fastest

785
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,610
on-screen it's open the browser for my

786
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,650
github just by clicking a button

787
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,920
this is features that already are

788
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,300
available in our this project is open

789
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,550
source the hardware part in the software

790
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,190
part so if you want to join in and feel

791
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,870
feel free there's a lot of stuff that

792
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,760
that we could do let me just go back to

793
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,360
the presentation

794
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:45,310
so yeah so I think my final words are we

795
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,960
live in a fantastic time to tinker with

796
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,530
with hardware ok I think the security

797
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,720
community is getting is well deserved

798
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,300
and gadgets there are a lot of projects

799
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,220
already but I think there's space for

800
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,680
more projects I think there's there's a

801
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,150
lot of potential for the security minded

802
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,490
folks to come into the other makers

803
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,520
movement and and do a lot of more more

804
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,910
gadgets that we need and we deserve

805
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,080
there's so much more to be invented and

806
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,660
my idea is to try to inspire if you ever

807
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,780
thought about making harder to do that

808
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,840
gentle to leap in to join in I think

809
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,660
it's it's easier than ever to do it

810
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,520
nowadays so this would be my final words

811
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,410
for the presentation except for one

812
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,720
thing which is kind of awkward so while

813
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,300
I was searching for images for that for

814
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,770
that slide with a lot of different

815
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,500
hardware I went to my friend the vid

816
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,960
suppose hardware at least he has a very

817
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,930
nice list of hardware and he also links

818
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,120
to other people are there lists and then

819
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,610
I was browsing around and I saw

820
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,700
something called key voce kevo board

821
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,850
anyone knows what the keyboard is no

822
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:11,350
okay I feel a bit better so the keyboard

823
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,230
this guy look three makers and Matty's

824
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,740
Vogue

825
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,930
invented keyboard and pretty much what

826
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,030
Hoover hit proposes to do and I started

827
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,950
to commercialize this like some months

828
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:30,800
ago only I don't have a keyboard I do

829
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,869
nor the one yet I noticed by the

830
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:35,240
pictures that they use a different USB

831
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,490
host chip but they also used 80 mega

832
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,560
they have a SIM version and they have a

833
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,900
Wi-Fi portion from what I read the the

834
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,750
brains of the speak of this software is

835
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,010
the atmega which limits a bit of the

836
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,950
things that you can store there has a

837
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,710
lot less memory but essentially the idea

838
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,050
is kind of the same and it's it's nice

839
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,900
to see that the hardware kind of flowed

840
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,140
all in the same direction I was a bit

841
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,000
pissed off I haven't found in this out

842
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,640
like one week ago of course it but you

843
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,770
know I had to do the shoutout it's a

844
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,100
nice insta nice product I'm happy that I

845
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,650
learned about this project just last

846
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,980
week because knowing me if I have

847
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,710
learned this like a couple of months ago

848
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,440
when I started who were he that would

849
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,050
probably be the motivator but I don't

850
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,450
think that would be good because the

851
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,330
things that you gain going through the

852
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,320
experience of imagining something

853
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,200
designing on paper then going to the DDA

854
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,660
and building the the schematics or

855
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,240
during the entire process is quite fun

856
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,670
to do it's very rewarding when you

857
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,470
actually build something almost by

858
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,160
yourself and then you see it working and

859
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,600
if it has like that some sort of

860
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,850
community potential even better and

861
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,770
probably I would miss that experience if

862
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,390
I figure this out this project a bit

863
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,280
sooner so anyway there's the the shout

864
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,480
outs and just I want to thank really

865
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,400
quick some some folks I want to thank

866
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,619
hecka died

867
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,210
Mike from hacker Larry because the being

868
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,490
in touch with actually allowed me to do

869
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,490
and write about other projects allowed

870
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,589
me to keep my hardware skills a bit

871
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:30,039
sharper I guess I want to thank Jason

872
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,140
Engels because he was a huge supporter

873
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,369
of my first order project and overall

874
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,349
thank you various for your kind words

875
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,660
and if it suppose we all miss you here

876
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,519
we will see you next year I'm pretty

877
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,109
sure thank you for your support

878
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:48,058
Thanks question

879
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,350
by the way thank you

880
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,810
by the way I have some Hoover heat kids

881
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,480
like the actually harder that you can

882
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,050
soldier yourself or what a bunch of a

883
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,690
bunch of different components and I have

884
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,090
some that if you're interested in your

885
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,010
project if you want to try it and you

886
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,900
want to soldier yourself please come

887
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,140
find me and I don't have a lot but if

888
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,390
you are interested in participating in

889
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,730
the project I will give them to you okay

890
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,290
thank you that's it so does anybody have

891
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:32,140
any questions questions it's show hands

892
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,510
[Music]

893
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:41,660
I wondered what your first project was

894
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,640
cuz you mentioned that there was someone

895
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,650
in particular helped you through your

896
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,040
first Hardware project yeah well my

897
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,060
first like real ordered I had the first

898
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,200
project a long time ago but my first

899
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,940
like real ardour project that I went

900
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,650
through all this process was called my

901
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,320
clock it was a piece of hardware

902
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,770
designed to figure out with which were

903
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,580
the positions of gunshots it's strange

904
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,110
but it has a background I had some

905
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,510
hunters hunting near my house and I want

906
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,370
to figure out where they were so I had I

907
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,320
made something that triangulate the

908
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,010
position by with an array of microphones

909
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:32,060
that was the initial idea anyone else I

910
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,020
[Music]

911
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,230
guess not

912
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:47,060
[Music]

913
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,480
so I wanted to ask regarding the Wi-Fi

914
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,140
antenna you you placed on the board the

915
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,590
planar antenna how did you copy it did

916
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,390
you go through

917
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,660
process what's your process to reaching

918
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:09,109
that that level or that layout for the

919
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:12,079
antenna you're talking about the Wi-Fi

920
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,490
yeah in the in the ESP module of the

921
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,829
module or did you copy no no it's part

922
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,750
of the module I didn't design that that

923
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,970
part that's the wonderful thing you can

924
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,460
just nowadays you can buy different

925
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,619
modules I mean of course if you're doing

926
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:29,900
a project like a professional project

927
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,900
you should hire at least one magical

928
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,599
engineer electronic with strong

929
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,880
backgrounds properly design and circuits

930
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,549
but if you're working in prototypes you

931
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:43,369
can just choose the components and

932
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:46,220
choose components that already do some

933
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,539
part of the work that you need and just

934
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:49,400
figure out how to couldn't connect them

935
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,650
and that way you kind of sheet and

936
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,869
bypass all the analog circuitry that you

937
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,109
need to know kind of that's why I always

938
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:59,630
try to bring all my projects into the

939
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,150
digital world where I can easily manage

940
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,150
them instead of fighting with the analog

941
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,000
part of the project because I don't have

942
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,069
an electrical engineering background at

943
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,519
all

944
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:22,039
I paid nice to meet you I want to know

945
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,349
if you have any plans on planting a mic

946
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:28,430
on your device because it should be very

947
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,660
interesting and I don't know well I

948
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,640
think you can ask that as a feature

949
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,490
during the project and you know in the

950
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,440
other design

951
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,200
part of Geetha is just plant a mic I

952
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,359
didn't thought about mics and I know

953
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:46,670
there are another at least one device

954
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,589
that does something like that that

955
00:44:48,589 --> 00:45:07,279
records the songs well who knows hello I

956
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:10,160
know it's an open-source project but are

957
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,230
you planning on selling the mounted

958
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,480
product for those that don't have the

959
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,150
skills to mount it themselves or by the

960
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,599
hardware well I don't know I think it

961
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:23,539
depends on the interest I'm not going to

962
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:25,190
say that the idea did not cross my mind

963
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,940
at some point but right now I'm more

964
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,109
worried that people work on it and it's

965
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:35,660
an open platform because I don't there's

966
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,869
no really open maybe there is

967
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,880
I didn't you know my research skills are

968
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,559
not very good but I know that at least

969
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,779
this platform is hardware is open source

970
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,609
software is open source we can work on

971
00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:51,710
it and build something maybe it makes

972
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:55,579
sense to offer a mounted version of it

973
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:58,130
an assembled version but given that

974
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,660
everything is going to be open source

975
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,700
I'm pretty sure that Chinese will do it

976
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,869
for me pretty fast so I don't know okay

977
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:16,160
thank you any more no because we wanted

978
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,630
to say something about how are you

979
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,109
brought with you and the vid maybe well

980
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:24,369
so the trade you wanted to do oh yeah

981
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:27,369
so the visa this awesome idea about if

982
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:30,430
you have like hardware that you don't

983
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:35,739
use or gadgets that you don't use for us

984
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,509
