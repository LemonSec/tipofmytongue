1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,400
so whenever I come to a conference I'm

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,550
really intrigued about the process that

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,220
a security researcher goes through to

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,949
get to the point of presenting their

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,980
findings I think that a lot of the time

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,249
in this industry we spend time talking

7
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,619
about the outcome of our work and not

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,539
sharing with each other how we go about

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,220
our work so before I ever presented at a

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,830
conference I was really enthralled by

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,380
the mystique that we grant researchers

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,020
there's something about the process of

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,880
being accepted into a conference that

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,630
makes them feel like almost like they've

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,050
got this Rockstar status and I think

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,510
there's a few industries outside of

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,110
security where we have a similar thing

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,450
going on so if you look at musicians or

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,180
artists we also grant them this sort of

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,559
special status and we somehow see that

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,079
they're different from us but as it

22
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:15,859
turns out it's not really the case so as

23
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,770
a debt to myself and I think as a way to

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,890
be more transparent to everyone in the

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,310
industry I want to tell you a bit about

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,090
my process for security research and I

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,670
think it's quite unique it's one process

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,159
so certainly other researchers will have

29
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,530
a different process and I think for me

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,109
they started before I entered the

31
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,249
security industry so my secret is that I

32
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,740
don't have a conventional education in

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,380
computer science my entry into this

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,539
industry was a little bit strange which

35
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,639
I'll tell you about so when I was going

36
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:01,229
on I had I had a dream that I think a

37
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,670
lot of people have when they were kids

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,060
I dreamt about changing the world and I

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,950
thought the best way to do that is to

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,959
actually see myself in roles so I

41
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,599
thought about the jobs that I could take

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,459
when I was older so the first job I can

43
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:14,720
say

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,860
it was to be a ballet dancer it doesn't

45
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,810
necessarily sound like a job that you

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,220
can make a lot of change in but I

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,260
actually believe that dance is a place

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,210
that you can make a lot of change that's

49
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,780
for sure

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,210
but the problem with this is I was quite

51
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,610
a tall child so this wasn't a profession

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,630
that I could continue and I also had a

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,600
strong affinity with animals when I was

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
growing up and I loved my pets and I

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
thought maybe I can be a vet because I

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,350
could save animal lives but the thing

57
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,380
about being a vet is you're also

58
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,700
responsible for the death of animals I

59
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,860
also thought about joining the Royal Air

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,660
Force because they have this program

61
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,500
which sponsors you to also carry out

62
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,620
your education so in return for meeting

63
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,510
some sort of academic merits they will

64
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,070
pay for your education so you can do

65
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,350
your undergraduate and then you need to

66
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,760
work with them for about five years

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,920
afterwards but the problem with this

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,410
idea is I figured I might end up dead

69
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,970
pretty quickly so eventually I settled

70
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,530
on being an artist you see the thing

71
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,720
about arts is historically it's brought

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,480
visibility to all sorts of in Justices

73
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,060
there's some really incredibly powerful

74
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,540
work and it has a way of disseminating

75
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,570
into popular culture so it affects the

76
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,480
clothes that we wear it really affects

77
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,780
everything that we do so art is

78
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,840
something that I consider to be my mid

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,440
my disease and it's helped me to foster

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,510
all sorts of qualities that I think are

81
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,040
really important to security and I'd

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,360
like to share with you

83
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,910
equipment by an artist called Tim

84
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,630
Roland's

85
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,370
and he says what sort of person wants to

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,850
make art in the first place

87
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,820
artists are literally diseased people we

88
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,728
live with a condition a disorder that

89
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,640
questions the existing order of things a

90
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,070
disease with the world that cannot be

91
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,460
cured

92
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,680
but can only be managed as best as

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,889
possible and I think there's a few

94
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,150
people set in this room that can

95
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,310
probably relate to that idea so

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,639
researchers have this incessant need to

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,330
question the order of things and the

98
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,009
more I thought about it the more I

99
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,810
thought that art and security are

100
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,860
actually related in some ways you see

101
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,020
when you think about arts arts is

102
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,110
actually thought manifested so if you go

103
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,050
into a gallery and you look at artwork

104
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,180
that is actually not too dissimilar from

105
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,849
seeing a presentation where I talk about

106
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,099
my ideas or seeing some of the talks

107
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:07,080
you're going to see later they're just a

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,680
product of a different process so as you

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,500
can see artists and security researchers

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
have quite a lot in common I think if

111
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,330
you're a security researcher if that's

112
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,740
your full-time job or if that's

113
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,240
something that you do independently

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,759
outside of the work that you do on a day

115
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,400
to day you have to spend a huge amount

116
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,150
of time coming up with creative ideas

117
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,289
you have to question a lot of things

118
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,080
which is the nature of being an artist

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,460
you also tend to spend a lot of your

120
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,560
time alone and it can be quite a

121
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,060
thankless job and interestingly enough a

122
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,199
lot of the time when you work as a

123
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,570
researcher or an artist you can spend

124
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,210
time exploring an idea at the end of it

125
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,919
you might have nothing to show but both

126
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,199
of these jobs share in common that at

127
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,690
some point you need to show to the world

128
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,930
what you've come up with so as a

129
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,509
researcher that maybe that's you talk

130
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,490
about your ideas internally to provide

131
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,130
value to the company or that you go

132
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,169
externally and you talk about your ideas

133
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,000
at a conference so you might submit to a

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,889
CFP so this is my methodology my

135
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,440
toolkits and the things that I use as a

136
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
way to live a very creative life it

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,330
helps me to be a better researcher and

138
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,000
it's a process I've learnt from art so

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,310
I'm calling it art as a methodology for

140
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,500
research

141
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,990
so the first thing is that creativity is

142
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,449
obviously a big part of being an artist

143
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,479
or researcher and creativity I like to

144
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,750
think about like a muscle it's something

145
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,960
that you have to use all the time

146
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,419
because you never know when inspiration

147
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,370
might strike you know what's really

148
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,340
fascinating about creativity is that

149
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,240
it's something that's innately human so

150
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,630
when our brains developed when our

151
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,520
frontal lobe developed that's the thing

152
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,560
that allows us to be creative so that

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,830
allows us to think ahead and to imagine

154
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,590
different possibilities so the actual

155
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,280
act of being creative is taking all the

156
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,590
input we experience on a day-to-day and

157
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,630
combining that into different options

158
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,660
it's not so much about coming up with an

159
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,910
idea that doesn't exist but it's about

160
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,710
finding different inputs in your life

161
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,750
and you're coming up with a third option

162
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,650
[Music]

163
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,690
so the first tool that I use that

164
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,699
artists use a lot is something called an

165
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,280
artist sketchbook and this is a place

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,039
where I think you can record your

167
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,229
thoughts and have a dialogue with

168
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,870
yourself before you invest additional

169
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,310
time into making something so it can be

170
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,919
a place where you record visual ideas it

171
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,349
can be a place where you record written

172
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,130
ideas as well and it can take many forms

173
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,080
so here's an example by an artist called

174
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,530
Olaf or Ellison and you may have heard

175
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,300
of him or you may not but he's quite a

176
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,110
famous artist and in his work he asks us

177
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,000
to reconsider our relationship to the

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,479
environment and he's had an exhibition

179
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,389
on at the Tate Modern in London recently

180
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,270
and you can see the way in which he uses

181
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,889
a sketchbook so instead of using a

182
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,229
physical book on the left hand side we

183
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,700
can see that the way in which he

184
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,370
explores his ideas is he tapes things on

185
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,750
the walls

186
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,909
and then on the right hand side you can

187
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,520
see his thoughts about materials and

188
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,800
prototypes when he was developing a

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,660
specific product so he made a

190
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,940
solar-powered lights and here we can see

191
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,680
the things that he's considered and

192
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,870
here's an example of my own sketchbooks

193
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,970
this is the first time event showed

194
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,540
anyone so I work on a wall quite a lot

195
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,150
and I was thinking about how is it

196
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,770
possible for us to introduce greater

197
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,430
privacy into the clothes that we were so

198
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,510
that's the consideration for this but of

199
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,160
course it doesn't have to just be

200
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,930
sketchbooks I also work a lot with

201
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,260
notebooks and I think that they can be

202
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,030
easier to work with I know a lot of

203
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,950
people keep electronic notes but there's

204
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,860
something nice about having tangible

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,070
books that you can carry with you and if

206
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,070
that doesn't work I also often take

207
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,110
things to the wall so here you can see

208
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,670
my thinking about the magnetic stripe so

209
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,410
I'm really fascinated by payments and so

210
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,210
one of the things I've been thinking

211
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,990
about recently is reconsidering our

212
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,550
relationship to things that we think we

213
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,680
know that we might take for granted so

214
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,630
I've been thinking about the magnetic

215
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,380
stripe on the back of a card so next

216
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,180
this is a really important thing and

217
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,830
it's something I would consider

218
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,380
I would encourage everyone to do so I

219
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,350
suggest that you get a hobby or multiple

220
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,390
hobbies outside of information security

221
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,360
and this is really important because

222
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,640
what it does is it increases the scope

223
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,830
of your inspiration so this year I took

224
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,390
a life drawing class I taught myself to

225
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,280
sew which you can see the product of

226
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,210
here we'll get into that later I titled

227
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,720
the kitchen and I built an ottoman I did

228
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,700
many other things as well and all of

229
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,400
these things might seem unrelated to

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,350
each other and they might seem unrelated

231
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,920
to security research but the important

232
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,660
thing about hobbies is that it teaches

233
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,850
you how to manifest your ideas in the

234
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,440
real world

235
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
the thing is even if you're a security

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
researcher the best way to explain your

237
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,090
idea to the world may not be in the form

238
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,460
of a PowerPoint and it may not be

239
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,330
electronically so the more options you

240
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,000
have for materializing your ideas the

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,640
better ultimately okay this is this is

242
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,950
what I would call a lifestyle approach

243
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,200
so question everything and this is

244
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
really about being curious for the world

245
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,370
it sounds like a very obvious statement

246
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,010
and it's something that I think we all

247
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,680
have as children that we grow out of as

248
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,720
adults but this is really important so

249
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,950
it's really important to be curious

250
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,930
about everything around you even if

251
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,700
you're making IKEA furniture and the

252
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,220
question is can I put wheels on that

253
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,130
what does it look like if I lie on the

254
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,720
floor and look at the ceiling instead

255
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,880
how does that change my perspective on

256
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,790
the world and I'll show you how

257
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,570
important this is even to my work

258
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,670
alright so at the end of University I

259
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,470
had made a lot of creative works and my

260
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,880
degree is in a creative subject and I

261
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,530
didn't really know what to do with this

262
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,730
physical work I didn't have the space I

263
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,770
was moving out of student dorms and I

264
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,360
thought I would probably just have to

265
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,360
give away my work or throw it away and

266
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,330
then I had a passing conversation with

267
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,170
someone in my full-time job and they

268
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,080
mentioned to me that they had a relative

269
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,470
who worked in a building very close to a

270
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,480
very famous art dealer called Charles

271
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,910
Saatchi who at the time was collecting

272
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,270
the works a very provocative artists

273
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,310
such as Damien Hirst and he was cutting

274
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,260
cows in half and I thought what if I

275
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,310
could come up with a plan to send my

276
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,030
arts to this art dealer and I had one

277
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,829
piece of art in particular

278
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,090
so I had a sort of 3d photo sculpture of

279
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,940
myself and I thought maybe there's a

280
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,720
possibility for me to send this in the

281
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,350
post yes unbelievably to this art dealer

282
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,880
and the thing about art dealers

283
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,680
especially people of this caliber

284
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,650
they don't accept unsolicited works so

285
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,240
you can't just send a package to them

286
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,730
even if you know the address because

287
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,990
they won't sign for it that weren't

288
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,230
accepted into the building so I worked

289
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,860
out a plan to get the security guard of

290
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,170
another building just sort of forewarn

291
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,510
the people in this other building where

292
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,040
the art dealer was so I took my photo

293
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,230
sculpture so we say wrapped it up in

294
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,390
brown paper it looked pretty much like

295
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,160
this so it looked pretty strange and

296
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,220
then I walked it from my flats to the

297
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,030
post office took it to the clerk and

298
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,760
asked to send it and they looked at me

299
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,540
pretty strangely I have to say but they

300
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,090
did accept it and then a few days later

301
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,300
I got an email we'll put that over there

302
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,240
for now I got an email from the staff

303
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
that Charles Saatchi saying that they

304
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,580
have received my artwork so the point of

305
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,430
this story is that this isn't about

306
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,530
security but it's about having a mindset

307
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,300
a lot of people would look at the story

308
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,030
and say this is social engineering but

309
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,320
it's about being curious a couple of

310
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,120
years ago I managed to buy an ATM and

311
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,970
you can see my two cats er playing with

312
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,760
the ATM which was a lot of fun and it

313
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,350
sounds like a very hard thing to do

314
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,690
which it is if you're an individual it's

315
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,670
quite hard to buy an ATM if you're not a

316
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,960
bank but the hardest part of owning an

317
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,260
ATM is moving the ATM so ATMs weigh

318
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,160
quite a lot and this ATM weighed a

319
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,579
50 kilos so close to a ton and as it

320
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,459
turns out most of the couriers in London

321
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,129
and the South East of England have a

322
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,529
tail lift so that's the bit on the back

323
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,410
of the lorry that goes up that's rated

324
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,129
for a maximum of half a ton or 650 kilos

325
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,490
that was the the highest I could find

326
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,810
yes so that's the big problem otherwise

327
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,689
you need a crane and ATM as part of the

328
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,389
security is not is about not moving the

329
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,839
ATM so how did I figure out how to move

330
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,980
the ATM well I thought that there's

331
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,959
probably a bit of room for error in the

332
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,899
engineering process and that's how I

333
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,079
figured out how to move an ATM is I

334
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,009
found someone who could lift 650 kilos

335
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:58,009
and got them to lift 850 and it worked

336
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:01,620
so the next approach that I would like

337
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,120
you to embrace is to move your body I

338
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,089
think in security and in tech we have

339
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,209
this approach or the wheaten we quite

340
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,899
often think of ourselves as a head

341
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,370
staring at a computer and that's how we

342
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,769
live our lives the thing is everything

343
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,750
that you do in your life is an embodied

344
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,420
experience so you're not a head and the

345
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,750
body you're actually a body and this is

346
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,370
really important so I would encourage

347
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,829
everybody whatever you're interested in

348
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,399
to use your hands to make things to do

349
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,589
things to it changes your relationship

350
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,149
to your work so as example as I

351
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,029
mentioned I'm interested in cards so

352
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,949
today I turned up as an electromagnet

353
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,660
now that might look very funny but you

354
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,050
see dressing as an electromagnet changes

355
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,449
my relationship to my own work and maybe

356
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,300
it changes your relationship to the

357
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,059
ideas that I want to share so maybe it's

358
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,270
not such a crazy idea to embody the

359
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,720
things that you do so I am really an

360
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,270
electromagnet

361
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,880
and yeah I did say that I taught myself

362
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,640
to sew and this is one of the outcomes

363
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,800
of that so I don't know if you can

364
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,130
remember that bar magnets they normally

365
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,119
have a north and a South Pole and those

366
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,760
poles are indicated by colors normally

367
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,070
just to help it become a bit clearer for

368
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,320
us so with an electromagnet the only

369
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,700
difference is that you're passing a

370
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,160
current through the magnet and if you

371
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,929
change the direction of the current you

372
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,520
can change the polarization of the

373
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,420
magnet from north to south

374
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,250
depending on the direction of the

375
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,660
currents

376
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,090
[Music]

377
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,190
all right so find the contacts for your

378
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,980
work the context for your work as a

379
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,080
security researcher and gives you

380
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,530
meaning for doing your work it shows you

381
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,960
other possibilities how you can manifest

382
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,790
your work so this is really important

383
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,770
and how you find the context for your

384
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,410
work as you ask yourself who are my

385
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,340
peers so who's operating this space you

386
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,410
ask yourself what is the what is the

387
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,440
reason for making my work and where is

388
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,960
my work situated and what I mean by that

389
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,420
is is it important that your work is

390
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,179
situated in 2019 or does it have some

391
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,900
relevance to other time periods so for

392
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,290
example for my own work what I do is I

393
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,179
look at security research and I ask

394
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,179
myself who's making work that might be

395
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,130
relevant to mine so it might be someone

396
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,200
like Adam Lori who's been around for

397
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,520
quite a long time in the security

398
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,330
industry but it's also artists so this

399
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,760
is a Greek artist called Turkish who has

400
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,550
been making a lot of work about

401
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,820
manifesting energy so for me my peer

402
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,020
group is also artists it's also people

403
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,940
who are working outside of art and

404
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,920
research so they might be working in

405
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,250
science so when you find the context for

406
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
your work it's really important not to

407
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,300
link not to limit yourself to a single

408
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,390
discipline I also find that children's

409
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,950
books are really informative because

410
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,010
they have an excellent way of explaining

411
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,890
ideas so I refer to those

412
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:30,190
lots so who is my peer group my peer

413
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,930
group for my own work of people like

414
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,480
Samy Kamkar Adam Lori but ought to ask

415
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,360
also artists so I've got these artists

416
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,730
here Takas and a sound artists called

417
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,860
Adam blame me so even if you're a

418
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,660
security researcher you should look

419
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,370
outside of your discipline there's a lot

420
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,190
going on that could influence your work

421
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,210
and why do my I make my work well I feel

422
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,860
that payments aren't particularly well

423
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,860
understood but also importantly I think

424
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,020
education and this is one of the reasons

425
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,670
why we're all here today is really

426
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,610
important and if you have the ability to

427
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,710
share knowledge with other people then

428
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:12,040
you should do so so next we enter the

429
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,380
nothing is precious famous or this is

430
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,120
where you start prototyping if you're a

431
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,180
researcher or an artist and nothing is

432
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,820
precious because at this point you don't

433
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,010
want to invest too much in materializing

434
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,600
your ideas you just want to work quickly

435
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,640
and come up with different ideas so when

436
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,690
I think about magnetic stripe see if I

437
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,190
can get that supply so I've been

438
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,180
thinking about magnetic stripe recently

439
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,770
and a way of visualizing that so you can

440
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,960
voice it visualize that by showing the

441
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,080
magnets on the back of the card so this

442
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,860
is furo fluid and what I did is I just

443
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,810
added a bit of water to it because fewer

444
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,300
fluid has magnetic particles in it and

445
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,760
it has a surfactant which allows it to

446
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,520
bind to water so if you add a bit of

447
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,670
water you can make it viscous enough to

448
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,360
work to show up the magnets on the back

449
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,080
of a cup which is pretty handy or you

450
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,460
can visualize it like this you can

451
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,200
actually use iron filings which will

452
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,450
show you up the permanently magnetized

453
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,530
parts of a card but

454
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,580
there's another way to think about this

455
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,410
as well so here I have some magnets

456
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,730
which are polarized in different

457
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,130
directions and another magnets so you

458
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,610
can see as it moves it's either

459
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,979
attracted or repelled from the magnets

460
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,440
so now we come onto the phase of

461
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,550
manifesting your ideas so this is an

462
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,520
illustration I've made of a work by an

463
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,280
artist called Joseph Gustav and the work

464
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,700
is called 1 & 3 chairs and in the work

465
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,370
there's a chair that you can physically

466
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,050
sit on and you can touch it's just a

467
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,750
normal chair and the artist hasn't made

468
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,760
the chair so he's bought the chair and

469
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,120
next to the chair is a photograph of the

470
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,570
same chair and next to that is the

471
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,500
dictionary definition of a chair so

472
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,190
what's happening in this piece of work

473
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,500
well I think what it does is it shows us

474
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,660
that there's many different ways of

475
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,560
manifesting an idea so the first way in

476
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,220
which we think we can show our idea may

477
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,720
not be the best way there's at least

478
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,970
three others and I think insecurity for

479
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,220
the longest time people like me have

480
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,720
been standing on a stage talking to

481
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,720
people like you about our ideas so

482
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,330
defconn's been running for I think 27

483
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,870
years and CCC has been running for about

484
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,870
36 years and in most of the modern

485
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,200
history of conferences people like me

486
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,170
have been talking to people like you

487
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,690
using a PowerPoint but why is that

488
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,390
is that because powerpoints are the most

489
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,100
effective way to show our ideas I don't

490
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,070
actually think so so my thought is that

491
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,150
in security we need to spend more time

492
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,090
showing our ideas in a creative fashion

493
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:24,800
rather than talking about our ideas in

494
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,810
art we use something called the studio

495
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,420
critique to receive feedback now this is

496
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,750
something that I think in the InfoSec

497
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,830
industry we could definitely add

498
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,620
so this is a way of receiving feedback

499
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,080
on your thoughts and ideas your work in

500
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,780
progress and also final ideas that you

501
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,910
have to show and what you do is you

502
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,799
construct a peer group of people you

503
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,679
know and you go around your work and you

504
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,690
talk about your work and you can get

505
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,150
friendly feedback before you present say

506
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,419
a conference or progress and the benefit

507
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,669
of this is someone else might have a

508
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,049
better idea or they might point

509
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,700
something out in your work that you

510
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:11,340
hadn't even noticed now finally we're

511
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,860
able to prepare to show our work to an

512
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,510
audience so I'm going to show you an

513
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,520
idea of mine in a slightly different way

514
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,070
you've probably been wondering what on

515
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,630
earth this is I don't know so as I

516
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,370
mentioned I'm dressed as an

517
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,440
electromagnet today so if you could

518
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,799
imagine that every time the invisible

519
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,450
electricity changes direction the magnet

520
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,500
also changes polarization so if we take

521
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,940
a look at the back of a card it has a

522
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,429
magnetic stripe which is made up of

523
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:49,260
magnetic material and then there's a

524
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,900
layer of plastic over the top so what

525
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,000
happens when we write information on a

526
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,909
card so what happens is an electromagnet

527
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,030
passes over the back of the magstripe

528
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,549
and it firmly magnetizes particles on

529
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,980
them and it does that by changing

530
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,309
direction from north facing to south

531
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,250
facing so we end up with zeros and ones

532
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,830
so when you pass the card back through a

533
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,340
reader those different polarizations

534
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,169
influence the signal so let me give you

535
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:22,830
a demonstration

536
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,830
I do have magnets in my arms all right

537
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,020
so I hang on a second I actually need to

538
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,210
get a camera because this is such a big

539
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,059
auditorium I think you're probably not

540
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,150
going to be able to see very well so let

541
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,840
me see

542
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,670
all right hopefully this will make it a

543
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:22,750
bit easier oh you see okay I think of

544
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,420
okay I've still got audio right I'm

545
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:38,440
gonna walk slowly right alright so I'm

546
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,760
gonna walk slowly because there's a

547
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,370
little bit of a delay can we drop the

548
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,820
lights a bit is that possible

549
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,480
well it's magic isn't it okay all right

550
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,850
so this there is a bit of a delay isn't

551
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:58,450
uh can we see that so what happens as an

552
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,220
electromagnet passes over the back of

553
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,130
the card is we can permanently

554
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,080
magnetized the different sections of the

555
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,430
magnet so let's have a look and we see

556
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,830
that hello

557
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:22,630
no that's very slow isn't it ah never do

558
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,430
a demo live right all right we're gonna

559
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,260
have to just keep the lights down low

560
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,320
and hopefully you'll be able to see the

561
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,540
lights and I'm gonna go over it alright

562
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,270
so imagine we're getting back into the

563
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,810
mode I'm an electromagnet I'm now facing

564
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,300
the magstripe

565
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,690
now I can firmly magnetize this part of

566
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,320
the magstripe

567
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,580
so that it's North facing up I can then

568
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,880
turn hopefully you can see this and

569
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,380
permanent agatized this part of the

570
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,160
magstripe can you see that at the back

571
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,030
wow that's amazing

572
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,430
so I can go along the whole card this is

573
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,320
basically what's happening but on a much

574
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,370
smaller scale and I can write to the

575
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:23,060
card isn't that much

576
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,909
[Laughter]

577
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:32,929
but there's one more thing all right

578
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:40,129
we're nearly there if you've got this

579
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:42,590
far if you're a security researcher or

580
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,179
interested it meaning a security

581
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,669
researcher now's the point where you

582
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:49,009
need to iterate on your work and develop

583
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:52,100
a body of work and that's really

584
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,019
important because what it means is if

585
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,090
you iterate on your work you can find

586
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,480
subtle variations and you can build

587
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,169
depth let me just turn this off

588
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:12,889
leaping at us so building a body of work

589
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,169
allows you to fully investigate an idea

590
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,509
and I really think that's important so

591
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:19,279
it's something that we do in arts quite

592
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,250
a lot is an artist becomes known for a

593
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,250
single sort of pursuit of an idea and

594
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,019
it's really important in research as

595
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,909
well because you gain a lot of depth and

596
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:34,009
finally at this point if you've been

597
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,899
following my methodology you've become a

598
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,909
researcher or an artist but guess what

599
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,500
you don't have to define yourself as

600
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,649
either you see the beauty of information

601
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,990
security is that we welcome everybody

602
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,379
and if you have interests outside of

603
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:53,360
security you can integrate them into

604
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,730
your into your work there's no reason

605
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,130
why you can't thank you for having me

606
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,169
[Music]

607
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:21,280
any questions no no questions all right

608
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,040
enjoy the conference thank you so much
