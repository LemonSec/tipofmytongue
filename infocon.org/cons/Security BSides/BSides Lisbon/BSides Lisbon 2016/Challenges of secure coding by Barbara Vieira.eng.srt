1
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:20,869
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope you are not tired or I'm tired</font>

2
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:23,840
and thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> still being here I'm</font>

3
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:27,730
Portuguese um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a Dutch</font>

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,680
company the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software improv group and</font>

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:37,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the headphones off SI g I enhancer them</font>

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,710
so i'm gonna tell you about the company

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,559
and what we do because they are

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,149
sponsoring me to be here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my Italian</font>

9
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,449
Boston you want to go conference in

10
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:50,090
Portugal and when you want to what you

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,739
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to justify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,690
budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the money you're spending so</font>

13
00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:00,050
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice company and the</font>

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,769
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do are very nice so basically</font>

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:07,070
what we do is we look at software and we

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,950
measure a software quality by<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping</font>

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,910
people in growing their software quality

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:20,179
so we have models based on the 20 50 10

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:22,039
ISO standard and among these models we

20
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:24,140
look at the maintainability of the

21
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:27,740
software in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term but we also</font>

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,349
look at security reliability performance

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,720
and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> properties so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we might with</font>

24
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:38,770
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we give advice to</font>

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,319
to our clients basically we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> um a</font>

26
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,348
consultancy company I'm not consultants

27
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,800
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> formally of the widest so let's see</font>

28
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:52,160
I'm researcher and I have a background

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,729
on many things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the same</font>

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,238
time so i did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc informal methods</font>

31
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,720
related with cryptography and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

32
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:07,489
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on security right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:10,848
savita there's no no no direct a trail

34
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:12,980
of my my knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I jump from you</font>

35
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:17,769
the different areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> in same related</font>

36
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:21,019
areas at the same time so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:28,170
what you expect from this top

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:33,750
you have any expectations so how many of

39
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:37,560
you know what is a sequel injection how

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:45,530
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did a sequel injection okay</font>

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:49,830
so this is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I yes so</font>

42
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,050
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do when we evaluate a</font>

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,090
software system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to tell</font>

44
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,340
something we have a lot of software but

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,100
we get from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients is for school we</font>

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,510
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge database I cannot say that</font>

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,670
is the biggest in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base in the world</font>

48
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,269
will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge advance of proprietary</font>

49
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,950
software from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what we</font>

50
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:16,250
do is to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the their software so</font>

51
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:20,010
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to develop secure software</font>

52
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:24,239
you have to be systematic and you have

53
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:29,820
to follow some guidelines of secure

54
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:33,330
software development and we start with

55
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:38,010
trading so all the developers should be

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:40,260
trained for secure coding and then when

57
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,959
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> start about developing a product</font>

58
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,480
they should start by finding the

59
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,260
requirements what are the security

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:55,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements of my system then they</font>

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:58,828
started designed coding and then they

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,850
need verify back to their software the

63
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:06,290
the cooler they meant verifies the

64
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:11,489
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they initially part</font>

65
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:16,500
and something went wrong so when you

66
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:20,310
deploy your software<font color="#CCCCCC"> something is not</font>

67
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:26,669
right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why so that's</font>

68
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:28,830
where we help our clients and they

69
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,349
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to earth like what did I do</font>

70
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:36,590
wrong where's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

71
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:42,050
but it is right so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is oops</font>

72
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:46,349
where does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spell so this is my theory</font>

73
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:49,650
but maybe this is right so all the

74
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,860
developers have a training are they are

75
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,469
all trained and then they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define</font>

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">disability requirements and what we</font>

77
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:03,810
usually find is the software needs to be

78
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:07,620
secure what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean no one really</font>

79
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows then because of that so you say</font>

80
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,490
your software is to be secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they</font>

81
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,400
fail to identify the threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're rid</font>

82
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,640
of their vulnerabilities and their risk

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:26,190
so they cannot cannot mitigate their

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,650
home abilities but they continue and

85
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,360
they start developing their software

86
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,070
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a functionalities and then they</font>

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to do something because the</font>

88
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,469
software needs to be secure so what they

89
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:48,200
do they build security has an overlay

90
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:51,540
and they try to do tests or not so

91
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,300
people usually fail in doing in testing

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,510
security requirements they do proper

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,230
unit testing of the functionalities not

94
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:04,200
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but sometimes but for</font>

95
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,170
security we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see any tested even</font>

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,680
fantastic some<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of a cough of our</font>

97
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:12,270
clients don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic so and</font>

98
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">this happens right so you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:25,650
news you have data breach and you fail

100
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:28,740
to be plan to deploy on time so she's

101
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,109
just blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah or it seems so but</font>

102
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,370
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do in the reality how do we</font>

103
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,070
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so basically we get a lot of</font>

104
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,760
code we look at the code and we try to

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:44,880
find the probabilities in the code it

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,610
might seem easy but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

107
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,430
developers are really imaginative they

108
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:54,150
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the most interesting things</font>

109
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:57,930
you can imagine and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

110
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:01,799
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard task because frameworks are</font>

111
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:05,250
different so now there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of height</font>

112
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,560
frameworks and you learn react everyone

113
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,750
is different one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these things</font>

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,510
together together with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend</font>

115
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,230
languages becomes complicated to analyze

116
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,870
because they like to the treaty stuff

117
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:21,000
and that's what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop so</font>

118
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,260
what do we do when we do secure code

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,600
reviews or software inspections hug so

120
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,700
we asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

121
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,100
look at the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture we don't look</font>

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,020
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a software to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the software we need</font>

123
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,890
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture so we asked</font>

124
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,409
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the designer system</font>

125
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,849
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for source code we asked</font>

126
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,930
sometimes for demonstration of the

127
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,560
system because we need to understand

128
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,420
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening and we try to</font>

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,160
understand how is their secure

130
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:55,440
development process but they don't get

131
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,120
on the obvious information so we can

132
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">always get a demo because the system</font>

133
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,980
works can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the source code and get</font>

134
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,490
some information of the development

135
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:12,270
process but that's all no requirements

136
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:17,580
and no design for security so what we

137
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:19,560
see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code it's not just white it's</font>

138
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,120
not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't see</font>

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,430
anything so we see good things so this

140
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not a snuff that everyone does the</font>

141
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,600
same or there's like a hundred percent

142
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,848
of people do exactly the same it's not

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">true but we see some good things</font>

144
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:40,770
happening somos software developers know

145
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:47,730
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some bad things and we</font>

146
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:51,150
see also some ugly so what do we often

147
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,910
find has the best practice

148
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,650
so everyone knows what is a sequel

149
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,579
injection so everyone knows how to

150
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:03,329
mitigate it so everyone is<font color="#E5E5E5"> perimeter and</font>

151
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:07,590
squares but I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

152
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:11,520
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind it's not because they the</font>

153
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:14,220
developers you want to use to validate

154
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,699
inputs to use brother /<font color="#E5E5E5"> impress queries</font>

155
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:22,950
but because all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> orem frameworks that</font>

156
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:27,780
are provided nowadays to parameterize

157
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:31,080
the queries the other thing we always

158
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:35,819
see is that because they use these high

159
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,850
frameworks nowadays and these front-end

160
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,220
frameworks already have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded</font>

161
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,280
security we always<font color="#CCCCCC"> see they take the</font>

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">front-end be validated so you can't do a</font>

163
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:54,089
cross-site scripting on the browser side

164
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,069
you can't do certain attacks or on the

165
00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:01,080
browser side because these frameworks

166
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:05,190
already provided some<font color="#E5E5E5"> security they also</font>

167
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,320
implement authentication correctly and

168
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,360
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

169
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,700
requirement often so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to improve</font>

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,480
login and password and there's mechanism

171
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,830
to implement this in the in the correct

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">way so they always using filters and</font>

173
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:27,180
this always works for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that usually so</font>

174
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,220
now everyone knows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

175
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:36,479
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be secure so</font>

176
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:38,460
everyone uses https TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.0 1.1 not</font>

177
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,130
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right one but they try to</font>

178
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:48,540
protect their connections and they keep

the Cyprus which that are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> four point</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for the web server which sometimes we</font>

181
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,230
dangers so they use security framework

182
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,130
so spring security Spring both security

183
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">those used at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least provide some</font>

184
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:08,759
additional security level or increased

185
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:14,220
purity lo with lo efforts from the good

186
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:16,499
side the developer site and they don't

187
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,209
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show exceptions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> directing to the</font>

188
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:23,399
user or they try to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font>

189
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:26,309
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that printing strike stack</font>

190
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,160
traces or in the accession directly on

191
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:31,259
the on the browser it's a bad practice

192
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,249
so they are going they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing good</font>

193
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:38,730
stuff at least the clients we have seen

194
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:43,529
I'm not we have we haven't seen the

195
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:45,509
whole world but there's things we don't

196
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:53,929
find and these things are actually very

197
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:57,269
easy to implement so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds weird but</font>

198
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:59,699
most of the times all the HTTP headers I

199
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,369
think for some level security or make

200
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:05,910
your application more robust are missing

201
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:11,669
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> cash control they don't they little</font>

202
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:17,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect cash secure cookies there's</font>

203
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:20,879
no one there's the very few developers

204
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:28,259
that actually use correct flats for for

205
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:30,389
cookies so access control so everyone

206
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,189
knows what application is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> login and</font>

207
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,559
password and you block the user from

208
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:39,360
entering and but about what about the

209
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,269
permissions are you allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute</font>

210
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain functionality the system I not</font>

211
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:49,860
allowed so this a part is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always very</font>

212
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:54,029
complicated implemented in a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

213
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,799
play and is sometimes done in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intern</font>

214
00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:02,819
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong part of the other of your</font>

215
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:06,569
system session tokens so they should use

216
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:09,238
the default session manager of the

217
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:14,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">framework we are using but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

218
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:14,269
they generate cookies that are based on

219
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:22,949
on the on user data for instance

220
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:25,230
it has the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is extra cookie so</font>

221
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,330
log files they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never contain the</font>

222
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:32,160
information that's necessary to form a

223
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:33,960
proper audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations and connections</font>

224
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,959
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end so everything is</font>

225
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,240
protected so your external network is

226
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,940
secure connections but internal at work

227
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,980
it's completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> open and this is this</font>

228
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,380
this could be acceptable if your users

229
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,730
are not inside sitting at work so if you

230
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,390
have everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same network and</font>

231
00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:00,120
you don't protect the dimensions then it

232
00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:04,110
becomes a big problem so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

233
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,990
see and this is a huge trend nowadays I

234
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,900
don't know why it's hard coded<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords</font>

235
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,780
so everyone uses the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password all</font>

236
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,920
the time to encrypt the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font>

237
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:19,920
passwords are sometimes in the clear in

238
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,229
configuration files which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already a</font>

239
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,360
bad practice but sometimes you find them

240
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,170
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code so meaning when you patch</font>

241
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,040
this code the code goes with a password

242
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was created by the developer and if</font>

243
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,660
you try to reverse-engineer this code

244
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:42,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can easily see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password that</font>

245
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:45,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's easy trick with the day what I</font>

246
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,140
think that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> often see is that</font>

247
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,599
developers don't know how to use crypto

248
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:57,030
levels and there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons for</font>

249
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,940
these I believe the main reason is

250
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,040
because crypto is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's no</font>

251
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">guidelines on how to use a problem</font>

252
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:10,069
cultural to properly use a crypto

253
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:13,590
library and I'm not going to continue

254
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:16,320
but what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is that most of the home</font>

255
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,600
abilities of software of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car of our</font>

256
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,150
customers it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the live is a use</font>

257
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,790
have vulnerabilities so you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

258
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,949
a secure software without checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

259
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,939
New York dependencies if you're the

260
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:33,350
practices are vulnerable or not

261
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:35,960
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's very</font>

262
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,750
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical it's the access control</font>

263
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,770
problem that exists in software in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:46,130
software systems and the reason that I

265
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,590
believe that so many are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there are</font>

266
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,830
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with permissions and</font>

267
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,810
checking permissions in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system is</font>

268
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:58,220
because they don't centralized at the

269
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,079
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> control and they don't define it</font>

270
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,940
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements face so this all</font>

271
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,590
starts in the beginning so that's why I

272
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,360
showed the development rescue

273
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,220
development life cycle because if you

274
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,900
don't develop in the beginning in the

275
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,150
ill don't start developing the beginning

276
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,130
right way then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will never feel from</font>

277
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">implements your software in the right</font>

278
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:20,240
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we are but we see sometimes so</font>

279
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,010
you see customers implementing access

280
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,110
control policies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front end</font>

281
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:28,450
application so on the browser side and

282
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:31,190
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice but what happens is</font>

283
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:35,120
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications nowadays expose</font>

284
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,430
arresting here in the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

285
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,990
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect your recipe I you can</font>

286
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:44,089
easily bypass all about precision<font color="#CCCCCC"> magni</font>

287
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,790
besides that loading all the content to

288
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:51,050
the browser leads a lot to a lot of

289
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:56,990
little breaches so but nothing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

290
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:58,819
always see is mixing development code

291
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,360
with production code so the production

292
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,180
code that is fast that is released has a

293
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,569
lot of developmental and this is a good

294
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:12,530
way of introducing a vectorial system so

295
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:15,349
you remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to maybe</font>

296
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:20,980
this is an example of what happened

297
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:20,980
there and we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

298
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,310
misconfigurations resulting from

299
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">development code that is embedded in</font>

300
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:38,379
production code and but we always advise

301
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:38,380
is a bit cleaner code is a fur coat so

302
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:48,480
how comfortable are you with crypto I

303
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:57,330
knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that guy that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna run</font>

304
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:59,520
away so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Credo the crypto kudos a</font>

305
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,610
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development in a real</font>

306
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:09,150

president of very cold nowadays

309
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,090
identified some mental mistakes and

315
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,340
lot of homegrown algorithms so people

316
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,140
instead of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard algorithms</font>

317
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,050
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick though they were implementing</font>

319
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:52,230
by obscurity is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> security at all so</font>

320
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:57,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing that he pointed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out is</font>

321
00:18:52,230 --> 00:19:01,550
you could be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a block cipher but</font>

322
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:05,610
with insecure<font color="#E5E5E5"> walls of operations also</font>

323
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:09,450
there was some kiss porky selection and

324
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,199
the key length was not big enough and it

325
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:17,190
was we used a random number generation

326
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:22,080
was never used or it was eased in an

327
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:25,520
improper way and the the current use of

328
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,280
the crypto API was not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

329
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,010
whoever see over this ten year so in

330
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,750
2006 i was even not finished I didn't

331
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,670
finish even my bachelor so I didn't

332
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:40,740
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about free go at a time and</font>

333
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:45,740
what I see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years in</font>

334
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,620
the enterprise world is that most of the

335
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,779
developers don't use homegrown ographers

336
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:56,008
and they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

337
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:59,849
alanis but everything else remains the

338
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:08,149
same so we still see a lot of incorrect

339
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:11,759
usage of crypto and the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

340
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:16,728
where does<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem line like what's the</font>

341
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:20,789
problem not developing your software

342
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:22,710
then some I believe that sometimes when

343
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,960
you train the developers the training is

344
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,469
not effective so you go to a training

345
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,599
off to one week you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

346
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">promised cured you have no background of</font>

347
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:37,859
pickles and you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become an expert</font>

348
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:40,710
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> one week on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security and on some</font>

349
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:46,830
fella p series of secure software that

350
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:51,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't work very well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes security is</font>

351
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:54,330
very difficult concept to grasp<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

352
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:57,899
developers are in the dark the con CNT

353
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:01,228
they try to do things but sometimes it's

354
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:05,758
hard so they try their best but they

355
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:08,489
fail because it's hard to understand and

356
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,710
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we see is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

357
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:12,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">no requirement so defining that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assist</font>

358
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,070
the system is secure is not a

359
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:19,440
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have specified one d150</font>

360
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:26,189
to a force what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

361
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:29,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system and because</font>

362
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:33,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any clue</font>

363
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:36,210
most developers go to very well-known

364
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:41,609
forums and try to understand how to vote

365
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:45,659
in script oh how to implement a security

366
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:49,619
in their software and then these forums

367
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:51,450
sometimes or most of times a lot of

368
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,939
insecure examples but because you don't

369
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,489
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it's what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct way you</font>

370
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:03,089
cannot judge whether it's insecure or

371
00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:04,809
not and the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crypto</font>

372
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,879
these the frameworks and lie

373
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:10,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that you see that I used that</font>

374
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">nowadays have a lot of embedded security</font>

375
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:17,649
sometimes I have the defaults have

376
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,408
defaulted are not secure at least that

377
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:23,320
many reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

378
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big problem because if you tell a</font>

379
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,070
developer use this library your software

380
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,199
is going to be secure if you do these

381
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,149
things and east but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

382
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,840
default then you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and</font>

383
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:39,070
developers don't read the documentation

384
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,259
or sometimes the commutation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

385
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:46,210
libraries is not available or it's not

386
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:51,369
clear enough so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

387
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:54,039
beginning I think the problem fails in

388
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:55,869
the beginning when you know when you

389
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,509
will have training but when you try to

390
00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:02,709
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a value system and when you define</font>

391
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:04,779
requirements and design so you don't

392
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,309
define the requirements then you can

393
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,649
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify threats and</font>

394
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:12,789
vulnerabilities so you can never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

395
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:15,369
together and then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to deploy</font>

396
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:20,320
a system or to verify justice system

397
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:25,299
before the deployment you have to test

398
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,830
it and when we see is so skype analysis

399
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,720
and dynamic analysis are rarely

400
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,379
introduced in the pipeline of the

401
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:37,210
development of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system only the the</font>

402
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:40,658
company have is a big company and have a

403
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:44,559
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature software a secure software</font>

404
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:47,499
development and sometimes clients don't

405
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,600
know what pentesting is which is be

406
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:52,869
dangerous because we think come on how

407
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,309
come you don't know what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all what you</font>

408
00:23:52,869 --> 00:24:02,769
need to do to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> your system</font>

409
00:23:54,309 --> 00:24:05,830
security so that's it um I promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

410
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:08,519
short I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many things to</font>

411
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:14,490
say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to present the ideas</font>

412
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,490
because I was sponsored to come here and

413
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:24,230
what we do is look at software so we

414
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,570
wrote a book about building maintainable

415
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:30,470
software so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 guidelines on how</font>

416
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:34,129
to write software and i only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three</font>

417
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:37,730
copies<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in c-sharp so if you want a</font>

418
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:40,700
coffee you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it afterwards but</font>

419
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can also hear omni hub and you want</font>

420
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to have your coat check for d</font>

421
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,379
steyn guidelines it's free and you can

422
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,840
use the better code hub which is a

423
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,270
platform that tells you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how mundane of</font>

424
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">all it's just awkward it's not free for</font>

425
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,100
enterprise software but if you have a an

426
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:20,020
open soft an open source software you

427
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:25,600
can use this so i guess it so do you

428
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:30,800
model as part of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready we</font>

429
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:35,780
so we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd also do a threat</font>

430
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:38,750
modeling is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the analysis</font>

431
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:42,350
development but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we mostly do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

432
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:45,380
code review because by the time we get

433
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,540
the client the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client already has a</font>

434
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,420
system that is being developed they want

435
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,309
the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> one stupendous system but</font>

436
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,700
they want to know what are the inside of

437
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:59,389
the system or the client has another

438
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,800
external company so I developing the

439
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,220
system and they don't know how the

440
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,169
system is being developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> so most of the</font>

441
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">time schedule secure or reviews but we</font>

442
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:13,940
also do some some threat modeling

443
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,919
analysis for<font color="#E5E5E5"> good you find it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> link on</font>

444
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff on a curve how do you communicate</font>

445
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,670
that your comments on terms what's the

446
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,220
workflow anything knowledge we take a

447
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of screenshots</font>

448
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,950
and we talked to the developer directly

449
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:37,090
and we tell them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did this wrong</font>

450
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:39,730
did you say no like you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

451
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,820
wrong you see it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad price they</font>

452
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,280
say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so</font>

453
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,110
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is to explain the</font>

454
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,918
developers or after afterwards the

455
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:53,379
management how what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact oslet</font>

456
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,750
for mobility in their system and the you

457
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,330
can say oh you don't have the HTTP all

458
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">their HP has it you should have me stay</font>

459
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,770
and Wyoming so you have to explain what

460
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,080
are they in fact the possible attacks if

461
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,289
you see them the most difficult thing

462
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,689
afterwards because not everyone

463
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:14,760
understands easily how what the impact

464
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,760
of the vulnerabilities in their system

465
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,408
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't make any kind of</font>

466
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,710
exploitation or something like that you

467
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:26,530
just shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this is where no we are not</font>

468
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:33,360
pastors so we checked security but in

469
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:37,210
time and some easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nile from developers</font>

470
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,719
easy like when you show page program you

471
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:43,799
let students<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for that we would have</font>

472
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:48,460
with me that infrastructure we could

473
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:51,010
make attacks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic so we usually</font>

474
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,900
we get to the source code we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we</font>

475
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:58,030
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say think that you don't develop</font>

476
00:27:52,900 --> 00:28:01,000
an apartment so how do you how do you

477
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:04,899
guys how do you guys tackle things like

478
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,690
race conditions and and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ghost</font>

479
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,960
was about that usually hard to track and

480
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,000
hard to explain because i worked in

481
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,340
development for eight years and every

482
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,740
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain some junior what a</font>

483
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,168
race condition was and how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell</font>

484
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,740
someone could lift money from the

485
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:28,299
website without<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in the second act</font>

486
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of him he went nuts but i lost four</font>

487
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:36,480
years for all of my life so

488
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,280
our our<font color="#CCCCCC"> made and so we don't fray sister</font>

489
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:45,390
look for buffer overflows in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

490
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:50,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a frenetic use diagnosis if the</font>

491
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:54,270
client asked for what we do is the we

492
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:57,750
try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check whether the development</font>

493
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,879
team performs a secure development from

494
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:03,570
the beginning of the system so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> advise</font>

495
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,930
on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build the the right thing and</font>

496
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:10,230
not not particularly but particular

497
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:13,200
plans of the system we can detect it but

498
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:16,890
that would make our analysis much more

499
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,480
expensive sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that if you</font>

500
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,700
have unlimited time to look at the

501
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,520
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to break all the doors</font>

502
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,800
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what we do we were more</font>

503
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,180
practical<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we try to identify threats</font>

504
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,280
on high level and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan and tell them you</font>

505
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,400
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this into a conference or</font>

506
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,500
authorization they have to do the test

507
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,160
not us so afterwards in two apprentices

508
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:46,230
and what happens most of the times that

509
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:49,470
the pen test<font color="#CCCCCC"> text alerts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we detect</font>

510
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:54,180
but they can't see the inside so the Fed

511
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:59,580
s more<font color="#CCCCCC"> um more black box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next week</font>

512
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:01,080
thanks for thank you so one of the one

513
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identified in</font>

514
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">the process was the requirements</font>

515
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:08,879
specification what are the deliverables

516
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,740
are how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> define the security</font>

517
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,520
requirements because that's really hard

518
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that's really hard on the system</font>

519
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,990
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fat</font>

520
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:23,400
modeling so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> started you can</font>

521
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:26,430
use try ah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> better than the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> holomap</font>

522
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">biology to identify price in the system</font>

523
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:34,850
and then and you identify how to

524
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:37,740
mitigate this these threats so so

525
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:39,719
approximate those there are classes of

526
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,570
potential problems like in fertilization

527
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what we smooth there exactly so our</font>

528
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,129
models will have a model we are not

529
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,610
doing this

530
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,890
so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with the ideas of</font>

531
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:54,340
nowhere so they have a model where we

532
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:57,040
have guidelines of secure development

533
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,780
and we check<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guidelines you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Colbie</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> once again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the</font>

535
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,899
specification for the requirement that's

536
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,909
what that's what that's what I'll be

537

Wireless input validations environment

538
